00:01:04,949 --> 00:01:07,218
<i>I know what you are.</i>

3
00:01:07,285 --> 00:01:10,420
<i>You're not one of us.</i>

4
00:01:10,487 --> 00:01:11,821
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

5
00:01:11,889 --> 00:01:14,125
<i>I look like everyone else.</i>

6
00:01:14,191 --> 00:01:16,426
<i>No. I saw your files.</i>

7
00:01:16,493 --> 00:01:18,195
<i>You're... you're...</i>

8
00:01:18,262 --> 00:01:19,829
<i>An alien?</i>

9
00:01:39,216 --> 00:01:40,717
Aliens are scary.

10
00:01:40,784 --> 00:01:42,420
Aren't you glad
they're not real?

11
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:47,691
Mom!

12
00:01:48,758 --> 00:01:50,061
Thanks
for calling, Deb.

13
00:01:50,127 --> 00:01:53,297
I mean, it wasn't
even that scary.

14
00:01:53,364 --> 00:01:54,999
He just gets
a little jittery.

15
00:02:02,505 --> 00:02:06,543
So that movie
really bothered you, huh?

16
00:02:12,682 --> 00:02:14,852
You didn't say anything,
did you?

17
00:02:25,129 --> 00:02:27,597
It's been days!
It's not healthy.

18
00:02:27,664 --> 00:02:29,400
It's a weak prescription.

19
00:02:29,467 --> 00:02:31,634
Anyway, you try
taking them away.

20
00:02:31,701 --> 00:02:36,140
Now he spends every waking minute,
trying to get that thing to work.

21
00:02:36,207 --> 00:02:38,242
Maybe
we shouldn't have told him.

22
00:02:38,309 --> 00:02:40,911
He lifted a
tractor with one finger, Martha.

23
00:02:40,978 --> 00:02:43,580
He was gonna figure it out.

24
00:02:43,646 --> 00:02:47,418
I don't want him
to feel different.

25
00:02:47,485 --> 00:02:51,688
He is different.
And it scares him, for good reason.

26
00:02:51,755 --> 00:02:54,158
Whoever put him in that ship
had no idea or care

27
00:02:54,225 --> 00:02:57,461
for how dangerous a world
they were sending him to.

28
00:02:57,527 --> 00:03:00,331
The more he knows, the more he can protect himself

29
00:03:00,398 --> 00:03:01,531
and us.

30
00:03:04,768 --> 00:03:07,771
We're supposed
to protect him, Jonathan.

31
00:03:07,837 --> 00:03:09,240
Not the other way around.

32
00:03:37,168 --> 00:03:40,404
<i>Right over left.</i>

33
00:03:40,471 --> 00:03:43,773
- <i>Now, right over...</i>
- <i>No! Left over right!</i>

34
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,742
<i>The image is flipped
on this thing.</i>

35
00:03:45,809 --> 00:03:47,610
<i>What? No, it isn't.</i>

36
00:03:47,677 --> 00:03:49,746
It's okay. I can manage.

37
00:03:49,813 --> 00:03:51,282
You both worry too much.

38
00:03:52,383 --> 00:03:54,051
<i>Shouldn't we?</i>

39
00:03:54,118 --> 00:03:56,887
I can't read
that, Mom. It's...

40
00:03:56,954 --> 00:03:59,957
You have to pull back
from the...

41
00:04:00,024 --> 00:04:03,827
<i>"Flying Man of Metropolis,
Spotted Over South Side."</i>

42
00:04:03,894 --> 00:04:06,263
<i>That's the third story
in two months.</i>

43
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:08,698
<i>Metropolis
isn't Smallville.</i>

44
00:04:08,765 --> 00:04:10,334
There are powerful
people there,

45
00:04:10,401 --> 00:04:12,669
who would love nothing more
than to get their hands on...

46
00:04:13,803 --> 00:04:16,907
You. Please, be careful.

47
00:04:17,475 --> 00:04:20,277
I will. I am.

48
00:04:20,344 --> 00:04:23,080
Now, I really do have to get to work.
Everyone's counting on me.

49
00:04:23,147 --> 00:04:25,483
I'm a big part of the team
covering today's launch.

50
00:04:25,549 --> 00:04:27,485
<i>Launch? Of what?</i>

51
00:04:27,551 --> 00:04:29,686
You'll read about it tomorrow in
<i>the Daily Planet.</i> I love you. Bye.

52
00:04:59,049 --> 00:05:01,118
Coffee boy! Over here.

53
00:05:03,888 --> 00:05:05,722
Here yo go, Mr. Troupe.

54
00:05:05,788 --> 00:05:07,925
Large skinny vanilla latte. No whip.
And I hope you don't mind,

55
00:05:07,992 --> 00:05:12,196
I had them add a dash of cinnamon to
the grinds. It really wakes it up.

56
00:05:12,263 --> 00:05:15,933
Mmm. Now, you know you don't
have to call me Mr. Troupe.

57
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,968
And uh, you don't actually
have to call me...

58
00:05:18,035 --> 00:05:19,970
Coffee boy,
get a move on!

59
00:05:20,037 --> 00:05:21,704
Excuse me.

60
00:05:21,771 --> 00:05:24,475
Mr. Luthor,
what can you tell us about S.T.A.R. Labs?

61
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:31,916
Today, is a great day
for Metropolis.

62
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:34,751
And indeed, the planet.

63
00:05:34,817 --> 00:05:37,955
With any luck, we'll soon have
answered the age-old question,

64
00:05:38,022 --> 00:05:40,991
"Are we alone in the universe?"

65
00:05:41,058 --> 00:05:43,494
The good people at S.T.A.R.
Labs are about to launch

66
00:05:43,561 --> 00:05:47,498
the most sophisticated,
orbital telescope the world has ever seen.

67
00:05:47,565 --> 00:05:50,733
And it's all happening
via a two-stage, liquid-fueled

68
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:55,172
launch vehicle,
built by none other than LexCorp.

69
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:02,012
I'll only be taking
one question.

70
00:06:02,079 --> 00:06:04,982
From the young woman
in the back. Hello, Lois.

71
00:06:08,252 --> 00:06:09,954
Lois Lane,
for those that don't know,

72
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:12,890
is the recipient of the
Luthor Journalism Scholarship.

73
00:06:12,957 --> 00:06:14,992
Haven't heard from
you in months, Lois.

74
00:06:15,059 --> 00:06:16,560
Studies keeping you busy?

75
00:06:16,627 --> 00:06:18,862
I've definitely learned a lot.

76
00:06:18,929 --> 00:06:20,497
Like how you built
that rocket with funds

77
00:06:20,564 --> 00:06:23,234
you received from a rather
hefty government contract.

78
00:06:24,702 --> 00:06:28,072
This president knows a good
investment, when he sees it.

79
00:06:28,138 --> 00:06:30,574
Does he know fraud
when he sees it?

80
00:06:30,641 --> 00:06:32,209
Gross negligence.

81
00:06:33,644 --> 00:06:35,879
Not the question
I expected, Lois.

82
00:06:38,382 --> 00:06:40,150
<i>That's how business is done.</i>

83
00:06:40,217 --> 00:06:42,752
<i>I practically sat him
in the Oval Office myself.</i>

84
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:45,723
<i>He owes me. More champagne?</i>

85
00:06:45,788 --> 00:06:48,359
<i>Legally, it's opaque.</i>

86
00:06:48,425 --> 00:06:50,427
<i>So you set up a ten million
dollar space program</i>

87
00:06:50,494 --> 00:06:53,931
<i>that the feds underwrite
to the tune of six billion...</i>

88
00:06:53,998 --> 00:06:55,966
<i>The rockets are junk, but...</i>

89
00:06:57,101 --> 00:06:59,136
"But who knows,
they might fly,

90
00:06:59,203 --> 00:07:01,838
and anyone moronic enough
to live close to a launch site

91
00:07:01,905 --> 00:07:05,075
deserves to be hit
by fiery debris."

92
00:07:05,876 --> 00:07:07,344
I have copies, Lex.

93
00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:11,315
Well, I hope you enjoyed
the champagne, at least?

94
00:07:14,718 --> 00:07:16,387
One at a time, please.

95
00:07:16,453 --> 00:07:17,554
One at a time.

96
00:07:24,328 --> 00:07:26,297
Looks like you
could use this more than me.

97
00:07:26,363 --> 00:07:30,034
Oh, you're a life saver.
Early shift.

98
00:07:32,303 --> 00:07:34,238
Mmm. Hmm.

99
00:07:34,305 --> 00:07:36,040
That cinnamon
really wakes it up.

100
00:07:36,106 --> 00:07:37,207
Yeah. I think so, too.

101
00:07:40,411 --> 00:07:43,147
Shouldn't you be part of this
feeding frenzy?

102
00:07:43,213 --> 00:07:47,718
No. Well, uh, yes.
But, no.

103
00:07:47,785 --> 00:07:49,787
Well, I'm glad
we cleared that up.

104
00:07:49,853 --> 00:07:53,823
Well, I mean, I'm not a
reporter, not yet, anyway.

105
00:07:53,891 --> 00:07:55,392
Just an intern.

106
00:07:55,459 --> 00:07:57,827
How does an intern
become a reporter?

107
00:07:57,895 --> 00:08:00,197
With a scoop like that.

108
00:08:00,264 --> 00:08:03,934
<i>Three, two, one.</i>

109
00:08:04,001 --> 00:08:05,235
<i>We have lift off!</i>

110
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:22,486
That's nothing.

111
00:08:22,553 --> 00:08:24,855
I've seen stuff in there.

112
00:08:24,922 --> 00:08:27,491
Experiments. Bizarre weapons.

113
00:08:28,192 --> 00:08:29,993
Containment cells.

114
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:32,663
All designed to neutralize
the kind of weird powers

115
00:08:32,730 --> 00:08:34,598
you read about these days.

116
00:08:34,665 --> 00:08:36,700
Super speed. Strength.

117
00:08:36,767 --> 00:08:39,203
All that alien stuff.

118
00:08:39,269 --> 00:08:41,271
It's like, we're preparing
for something.

119
00:08:42,139 --> 00:08:43,807
If you ask me,

120
00:08:43,874 --> 00:08:47,111
I'd say somebody already knows
we're not alone in the universe.

121
00:08:50,948 --> 00:08:52,549
Can you get me inside?

122
00:08:52,616 --> 00:08:53,650
Helluva scoop, huh?

123
00:08:53,717 --> 00:08:56,286
But no, uh...

124
00:08:56,954 --> 00:08:58,555
I gotta work.

125
00:08:58,622 --> 00:09:02,359
My kid, he's in first grade.
We got another on the way.

126
00:09:03,093 --> 00:09:04,628
What if my name came out?

127
00:09:05,529 --> 00:09:07,598
I protect my people.

128
00:09:07,664 --> 00:09:10,033
I think you're the one
that might need protecting.

129
00:09:11,802 --> 00:09:14,104
Two tours in Iraq.

130
00:09:14,171 --> 00:09:16,807
I know a shadow
when I see it.

131
00:09:16,875 --> 00:09:20,077
Someone's interested in you, kid.
I'd watch your back.

132
00:09:29,019 --> 00:09:30,921
Look! Up in the sky!

133
00:09:40,899 --> 00:09:42,366
Whoa! Hey, maybe we should...

134
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:48,405
Damn.

135
00:09:53,744 --> 00:09:54,978
You gotta be kidding me.

136
00:11:17,761 --> 00:11:21,298
Eyes up here!
Everybody, come on.

137
00:11:21,365 --> 00:11:25,469
I know I don't say it very often, but I
am always, always, looking out for you!

138
00:11:25,536 --> 00:11:27,337
We're a team.

139
00:11:29,874 --> 00:11:33,710
That's why I'm showing you what
a real reporter looks like!

140
00:11:33,777 --> 00:11:36,813
Maybe knock some sense into
the more worthless of you.

141
00:11:36,881 --> 00:11:39,149
- Oh, Jesus!
- Oh, classic Perry!

142
00:11:39,216 --> 00:11:41,920
Anyway, meet the newest
addition to the team.

143
00:11:41,986 --> 00:11:46,056
The grad student who took
down a billionaire genius.

144
00:11:46,123 --> 00:11:48,592
An actual talent. Lois Lane.

145
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,770
- A grad student? Are you kidding me with this?
- Welcome, kid.

146
00:11:59,836 --> 00:12:00,837
Welcome to the team.

147
00:12:03,307 --> 00:12:06,677
See, now they hate you.
That couldn't have gone better.

148
00:12:31,735 --> 00:12:33,303
Uh, Miss Lane.

149
00:12:33,370 --> 00:12:35,405
Don't worry,
it's under control.

150
00:12:40,243 --> 00:12:42,746
There. Lois, by the way.

151
00:12:42,813 --> 00:12:44,147
Just... Lois.

152
00:12:44,214 --> 00:12:46,283
Cool. Just Lois.

153
00:12:48,585 --> 00:12:49,820
And you are?

154
00:12:49,887 --> 00:12:52,155
Oh, I'm coffee... Uh, Clark.

155
00:12:52,222 --> 00:12:54,625
I'm Clark Kent. <i>Daily Planet.</i>

156
00:12:54,691 --> 00:12:56,259
No kidding.

157
00:12:56,326 --> 00:12:59,563
Right. Sorry. I'm just...
I was there at S.T.A.R. Labs.

158
00:12:59,630 --> 00:13:01,899
I saw what you did.
It was amazing.

159
00:13:01,966 --> 00:13:03,433
That creep had it coming.

160
00:13:05,268 --> 00:13:07,404
Can I just... how did you do it?

161
00:13:07,471 --> 00:13:09,439
I mean, I know, the champagne.

162
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:14,678
It wasn't like that.
Trust me.

163
00:13:14,745 --> 00:13:18,749
People with that much power think
they wield it over everyone.

164
00:13:18,815 --> 00:13:21,351
If you can take that away
from them, for a moment,

165
00:13:21,418 --> 00:13:23,353
you can take it away for good.

166
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:24,989
It's called a power move.

167
00:13:25,056 --> 00:13:28,492
And I don't want to brag,
but it's kind of my specialty.

168
00:13:29,593 --> 00:13:31,395
Well that, and paper jams.

169
00:13:31,461 --> 00:13:34,032
Any other questions?

170
00:13:34,098 --> 00:13:38,136
If you're gonna be a reporter, kid,
you gotta ask all the questions.

171
00:13:38,201 --> 00:13:40,671
It's just... what do you do now?

172
00:13:40,737 --> 00:13:43,407
You've already taken down the
most powerful man in the world.

173
00:13:45,275 --> 00:13:46,576
Have I?

174
00:13:48,146 --> 00:13:50,247
Have a nice weekend,
Coffee Boy!

175
00:13:53,650 --> 00:13:54,919
Uh, Lois, you left your...

176
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,535
Hmm.

177
00:14:14,771 --> 00:14:16,174
All right.

178
00:14:16,239 --> 00:14:18,575
<i>Breaking news.
An unidentified object</i>

179
00:14:18,642 --> 00:14:22,046
<i>heading towards Earth
was detected by S.T.A.R. Labs.</i>

180
00:14:22,113 --> 00:14:23,547
<i>Stay tuned for updates.</i>

181
00:14:23,613 --> 00:14:25,282
Has anybody seen
this thing?

182
00:14:25,348 --> 00:14:26,683
Do we have a visual?

183
00:14:38,595 --> 00:14:40,363
You gotta figure out
what happened.

184
00:14:40,430 --> 00:14:41,832
- Does anyone know where it is?
- Hold on one second.

185
00:15:28,278 --> 00:15:29,579
Why are you here?

186
00:15:32,382 --> 00:15:34,718
Why are you here?

187
00:15:34,785 --> 00:15:35,987
Kryptonian!

188
00:15:37,354 --> 00:15:38,789
What did you say?

189
00:15:38,856 --> 00:15:42,759
'Course I never heard
of no flying Kryptonian!

190
00:15:42,826 --> 00:15:44,828
But, whatevs.

191
00:16:16,326 --> 00:16:19,329
Guess we're doing this
the fun way!

192
00:16:56,868 --> 00:17:01,371
Don't struggle now.
You'll just make 'em vengeful.

193
00:17:28,966 --> 00:17:31,401
This planet
is protected, alien.

194
00:17:35,273 --> 00:17:36,740
Alien?

195
00:17:36,806 --> 00:17:39,110
They ain't got mirrors
on this dump?

196
00:17:39,176 --> 00:17:43,214
You're as alien as they come
around here, Kryptonian.

197
00:17:43,281 --> 00:17:46,783
Kryptonian? I'm a Kryptonian.

198
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:53,124
You're <i>the</i> Kryptonian.

199
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:57,494
Last one in the universe
tucked away in Sector 2814.

200
00:17:57,560 --> 00:18:01,464
You got an awful big bounty on
that stupid looking head o' yers.

201
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,235
You're here for me.

202
00:18:04,302 --> 00:18:09,173
So, I guess... I guess that means,
you have to bring me in alive,

203
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:10,740
bounty hunter.

204
00:18:13,177 --> 00:18:14,844
Name's Lobo.

205
00:18:15,812 --> 00:18:16,746
And...

206
00:18:18,648 --> 00:18:19,816
Nah.

207
00:18:26,489 --> 00:18:29,060
Mess with the main man,

208
00:18:29,126 --> 00:18:30,460
and you get the...

209
00:18:35,433 --> 00:18:38,035
Well, frag the shit out of me.

210
00:18:49,512 --> 00:18:51,681
You sure you're from Krypton?

211
00:18:52,283 --> 00:18:53,884
I'm from Kansas.

212
00:18:53,951 --> 00:18:57,288
Well, something about Kansas
made you strong.

213
00:18:57,355 --> 00:18:58,621
Weird strong.

214
00:19:06,763 --> 00:19:09,166
I like it.

215
00:20:06,190 --> 00:20:08,426
<i>It appears the flying man
is headed towards the bay.</i>

216
00:20:08,492 --> 00:20:11,362
<i>Perhaps, he's had enough
and is in retreat.</i>

217
00:20:11,429 --> 00:20:14,865
<i>Perhaps, he's trying to move
the fight to safer ground.</i>

218
00:20:26,210 --> 00:20:27,777
They're coming here.

219
00:20:27,844 --> 00:20:30,014
Go! Go! Move!

220
00:21:13,257 --> 00:21:14,859
I wonder...

221
00:21:16,626 --> 00:21:18,195
can you see in the dark!

222
00:22:05,476 --> 00:22:06,410
Agh!

223
00:22:55,059 --> 00:22:55,993
Agh!

224
00:23:21,652 --> 00:23:22,886
Get back!

225
00:23:42,406 --> 00:23:44,642
Purty, ain't it?

226
00:23:44,708 --> 00:23:47,044
You know I'm not one
fer poetry,

227
00:23:47,111 --> 00:23:51,415
but seeing how it was Krypton
itself killed yer people,

228
00:23:51,482 --> 00:23:53,150
s'only right this ring,

229
00:23:53,217 --> 00:23:56,153
carved from the remains
of that doomed rock,

230
00:23:56,220 --> 00:23:59,390
should be the thing
to mess you up.

231
00:24:17,308 --> 00:24:18,542
Huh? Agh!

232
00:24:30,454 --> 00:24:32,856
- Oh! What is that thing?
- What in God's name...

233
00:24:32,923 --> 00:24:34,325
- Do you see that?
- Let's get outta here!

234
00:24:34,391 --> 00:24:36,560
Tell me you're rolling.
Roll tape! Roll tape!

235
00:24:36,627 --> 00:24:40,464
Well, how 'bout this?
A goddamn Martian.

236
00:25:54,705 --> 00:25:56,440
Look!

237
00:26:19,963 --> 00:26:23,200
You were right.
This was the fun way.

238
00:26:41,051 --> 00:26:43,053
Oh, my God,
it's incredible!

239
00:26:49,359 --> 00:26:52,129
Great Caesar's ghost!

240
00:26:52,196 --> 00:26:55,332
It's been days, people! Days!

241
00:26:55,399 --> 00:26:57,234
I may be the managing editor,

242
00:26:57,301 --> 00:27:00,137
but I'm also
a <i>Daily Planet</i> subscriber.

243
00:27:00,204 --> 00:27:02,339
I read the damn thing
every day.

244
00:27:02,406 --> 00:27:04,975
Hell, I read it
the night before every day

245
00:27:05,042 --> 00:27:06,543
and I still don't know

246
00:27:06,610 --> 00:27:10,447
Where are the aliens from?
What do they want with us?

247
00:27:10,514 --> 00:27:13,784
And what are their weaknesses,
if any?

248
00:27:13,852 --> 00:27:14,953
Chief, maybe if we...

249
00:27:15,018 --> 00:27:17,488
Are you talking
or am I talking?

250
00:27:18,088 --> 00:27:19,690
You're talking.

251
00:27:19,756 --> 00:27:23,293
Damn skippy! And, yes, Troupe,
we got a little carried away

252
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:25,195
with coverage
of the Flying Man.

253
00:27:25,262 --> 00:27:27,966
The Superman.

254
00:27:28,031 --> 00:27:31,201
Write it all you want, Lois,
it's never gonna catch on.

255
00:27:31,268 --> 00:27:35,439
Listen up! The flying man
is no longer the story.

256
00:27:35,506 --> 00:27:37,474
I want aliens.

257
00:27:37,541 --> 00:27:39,978
Everybody stop
whatever you're doing

258
00:27:40,043 --> 00:27:43,146
and get me copy
about the aliens!

259
00:27:43,213 --> 00:27:46,216
Well that's it.
Get back to work.

260
00:27:51,154 --> 00:27:52,623
Speaking of the Superman,

261
00:27:52,689 --> 00:27:54,458
though I think
Perry's right by the way,

262
00:27:54,525 --> 00:27:56,026
it's never going to catch on.

263
00:27:56,093 --> 00:27:57,227
Didn't you have
an interview scheduled?

264
00:27:57,294 --> 00:27:59,931
Like five minutes ago?

265
00:27:59,998 --> 00:28:03,834
Oh, Clark.
So innocent.

266
00:28:03,902 --> 00:28:05,802
I'm not going to that.

267
00:28:05,870 --> 00:28:08,238
See, right now, the Superman is
waiting for me up there on the roof,

268
00:28:08,305 --> 00:28:11,009
getting more
and more impatient.

269
00:28:11,074 --> 00:28:13,477
Ah, it's a "power move."

270
00:28:13,544 --> 00:28:16,547
It's a power move.
Eventually, he'll give up

271
00:28:16,613 --> 00:28:19,017
and, if he's the egomaniac
I think he is,

272
00:28:19,082 --> 00:28:22,085
he will beg me to reschedule.

273
00:28:25,055 --> 00:28:26,925
And when you do...

274
00:28:26,991 --> 00:28:30,193
Big Brave Strong Man
will be putty in my hands.

275
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:32,663
He'll answer anything.

276
00:28:32,729 --> 00:28:36,500
Where do you come from? Do you
report to some kind of leader?

277
00:28:39,570 --> 00:28:41,405
It sounds like
you think he's...

278
00:28:41,471 --> 00:28:44,976
Another alien?
He flies and can push rockets.

279
00:28:45,043 --> 00:28:47,244
Of course he is.

280
00:28:47,311 --> 00:28:51,582
But, uh, what if he denies it?

281
00:28:51,648 --> 00:28:53,684
Then he's fallen
right into my trap.

282
00:28:53,750 --> 00:28:55,786
See, by then, I'll have
gotten the real truth

283
00:28:55,853 --> 00:28:58,388
from my interview
with the loud, hairy one.

284
00:28:58,455 --> 00:29:00,691
Wait, you're interviewing Lobo?

285
00:29:00,757 --> 00:29:03,226
Isn't he locked up
at S.T.A.R. Labs?

286
00:29:03,293 --> 00:29:05,228
He knows the Superman.

287
00:29:05,295 --> 00:29:08,298
He wants to take him down,
but now he's behind bars.

288
00:29:08,365 --> 00:29:12,102
Lucky for Lobo, I'm not.

289
00:29:12,169 --> 00:29:14,404
So that's it.
You took down Luthor

290
00:29:14,471 --> 00:29:17,774
and now you're doing
an expose on the Flying Man?

291
00:29:18,709 --> 00:29:20,410
No.

292
00:29:20,477 --> 00:29:23,280
I'm winning a Pulitzer
for my revelatory takedown

293
00:29:23,347 --> 00:29:26,985
of the alien who calls himself
"The Superman."

294
00:29:27,051 --> 00:29:28,619
He doesn't call himself that!

295
00:29:33,457 --> 00:29:37,594
Not "Flying Man,"
not "Superman," not "Clark..."

296
00:29:39,396 --> 00:29:41,365
Certainly not "Kryptonian."

297
00:29:41,431 --> 00:29:43,500
It's everything
you warned me about.

298
00:29:43,567 --> 00:29:44,902
They meet someone
from the stars

299
00:29:44,969 --> 00:29:47,905
and their first instinct
is to fire at will.

300
00:29:49,239 --> 00:29:51,208
They love you.

301
00:29:54,979 --> 00:29:56,513
They don't know me.

302
00:29:57,581 --> 00:30:00,417
And I'm afraid that,
when they do...

303
00:30:00,484 --> 00:30:03,220
Maybe you're what they need.
If they knew about you,

304
00:30:03,286 --> 00:30:04,788
maybe they'd
see things differently.

305
00:30:04,856 --> 00:30:09,426
Or maybe the government
will lock him up, or worse.

306
00:30:09,493 --> 00:30:11,062
At some point
they're gonna ask me

307
00:30:11,129 --> 00:30:13,530
where I'm from
and why I was sent here,

308
00:30:13,597 --> 00:30:16,299
and I won't have the answers.

309
00:30:16,366 --> 00:30:18,201
And in the meantime,
one way or another,

310
00:30:18,268 --> 00:30:22,572
Lois is going to
publish her expose.

311
00:30:22,639 --> 00:30:25,609
You know what we're gonna say.
What we've always said.

312
00:30:25,676 --> 00:30:29,579
"The world is dangerous
and unforgiving."

313
00:30:29,646 --> 00:30:32,950
If you're different, special,
you have two options.

314
00:30:33,017 --> 00:30:34,518
You can either...

315
00:30:34,584 --> 00:30:36,186
"Either meet it head-on
and accept the consequences,

316
00:30:36,253 --> 00:30:39,489
or you can keep your head down
and accept the consequences.

317
00:30:39,556 --> 00:30:41,224
There's no wrong choice,
but..."

318
00:30:41,291 --> 00:30:43,427
You have to make one.

319
00:30:43,861 --> 00:30:45,328
Why?

320
00:30:45,395 --> 00:30:48,598
Because you're not
our little boy anymore.

321
00:30:48,665 --> 00:30:51,668
Becoming a man means making
these choices for yourself.

322
00:30:52,703 --> 00:30:54,005
Just be ready,

323
00:30:54,072 --> 00:30:57,841
because each choice,
each action, has a consequence.

324
00:31:12,489 --> 00:31:14,291
Excuse me, do we know...

325
00:31:14,357 --> 00:31:15,459
Nothing yet.

326
00:31:16,293 --> 00:31:18,762
Is Daddy gonna be okay?

327
00:31:33,111 --> 00:31:34,745
Here we go.

328
00:31:39,851 --> 00:31:42,452
Half the liver,
one kidney, the spleen.

329
00:31:42,519 --> 00:31:44,654
Every day another organ fails.

330
00:31:44,721 --> 00:31:46,958
What the hell happened
to this guy?

331
00:31:47,024 --> 00:31:48,458
I'm going to
close him back up.

332
00:31:48,525 --> 00:31:49,894
Give me the...

333
00:31:52,864 --> 00:31:55,332
Code Black!
Call it in! Go!

334
00:31:56,566 --> 00:31:58,401
Agh! Agh!

335
00:32:34,906 --> 00:32:37,707
I know it's not for good,
but sure is nice

336
00:32:37,774 --> 00:32:40,310
having you here
helping out, Clark.

337
00:32:40,377 --> 00:32:42,146
Pa, I can help anytime.

338
00:32:42,213 --> 00:32:44,282
It takes me less than ten minutes
to get here from the city,

339
00:32:44,347 --> 00:32:46,250
you just have to
let me know when...

340
00:32:46,316 --> 00:32:47,417
Clark?

341
00:32:47,484 --> 00:32:49,053
Stop the truck.

342
00:33:08,272 --> 00:33:10,107
Evening, stranger.

343
00:33:11,275 --> 00:33:13,044
I've come for your son.

344
00:33:16,214 --> 00:33:17,714
Our son isn't here.

345
00:33:19,283 --> 00:33:21,118
Something we can do for ya?

346
00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:24,055
You can tell me where he is.

347
00:33:25,655 --> 00:33:28,192
Sir, unless you want to
show us some credentials,

348
00:33:28,259 --> 00:33:30,393
I think we're done here.

349
00:33:32,362 --> 00:33:33,898
Martha, get behind me.

350
00:33:34,899 --> 00:33:37,301
I'm sorry.

351
00:33:37,367 --> 00:33:39,303
Sorry for wh...

352
00:33:39,369 --> 00:33:44,407
Jonathan? What's happening?
What are you doing to him?

353
00:34:00,390 --> 00:34:01,893
Get inside, lock the doors.

354
00:34:30,754 --> 00:34:32,722
Are you another bounty hunter?

355
00:34:40,331 --> 00:34:42,766
I am no Bounty Hunter.

356
00:34:44,467 --> 00:34:47,737
My name is J'onn.

357
00:34:49,173 --> 00:34:52,542
And I only wish to
speak with you.

358
00:35:00,351 --> 00:35:02,153
Call me when you
need the refill.

359
00:35:04,454 --> 00:35:05,990
Ahem. Next?

360
00:35:11,329 --> 00:35:14,831
Uh, did, uh, someone call in
a prescription for you, sir?

361
00:35:14,899 --> 00:35:17,734
Pain... I have... so much...

362
00:35:17,801 --> 00:35:20,271
- Sir, you don't look...
- Drugs.

363
00:35:20,338 --> 00:35:23,074
I'm sorry, without a
prescription, I can't help you.

364
00:35:23,140 --> 00:35:26,043
But there is a clinic nearby
where you can detox...

365
00:35:26,110 --> 00:35:27,311
I need to get home!

366
00:35:33,084 --> 00:35:34,651
I need...

367
00:35:34,718 --> 00:35:37,121
a post-surgical analgesic.

368
00:35:38,055 --> 00:35:39,622
Fentanyl.

369
00:35:39,689 --> 00:35:41,624
I need fentanyl!

370
00:35:52,236 --> 00:35:53,204
Huh?

371
00:36:06,649 --> 00:36:09,586
I apologize
for frightening you earlier.

372
00:36:09,652 --> 00:36:11,255
- Are you...
- I'm fine.

373
00:36:11,322 --> 00:36:14,524
Just don't get
in my head again, okay?

374
00:36:14,591 --> 00:36:17,727
I'm sure you boys
have a lot to talk about.

375
00:36:17,794 --> 00:36:21,132
Clark, if...
John is staying over,

376
00:36:21,198 --> 00:36:23,300
there are sheets
in the hall cupboard and...

377
00:36:23,367 --> 00:36:25,635
We're fine, Ma. G'night.

378
00:36:34,844 --> 00:36:37,814
I thought Martians
only existed in the movies.

379
00:36:39,917 --> 00:36:42,219
Those movies are terrible.

380
00:36:45,022 --> 00:36:49,659
Thank you. For S.T.A.R. Labs.
You saved my life.

381
00:36:51,828 --> 00:36:55,199
I should never have
revealed my natural form.

382
00:36:55,266 --> 00:36:57,034
Why did you?

383
00:36:57,101 --> 00:36:59,602
I mean, if you can
disguise yourself...

384
00:36:59,669 --> 00:37:01,472
To distract Lobo.

385
00:37:01,539 --> 00:37:04,341
He came for
the last Kryptonian.

386
00:37:04,408 --> 00:37:07,278
I offered him something
of equal value.

387
00:37:07,344 --> 00:37:11,282
You're... the last.
You're like me.

388
00:37:14,051 --> 00:37:17,121
It was
a foolish miscalculation.

389
00:37:17,188 --> 00:37:20,257
This world wasn't ready.

390
00:37:20,324 --> 00:37:25,863
Ready or not, Lobo came to us.
That's when everything changed.

391
00:37:25,930 --> 00:37:29,433
Nevertheless, I will be
reverting to human form

392
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:33,904
and maintaining a low profile
for the foreseeable future.

393
00:37:33,971 --> 00:37:36,540
I advise you to do the same.

394
00:37:36,606 --> 00:37:39,910
If we remain hidden, we live.

395
00:37:41,345 --> 00:37:43,581
Doesn't sound like
much of a life.

396
00:37:43,646 --> 00:37:45,015
Perhaps not.

397
00:37:45,082 --> 00:37:48,018
But as the last survivors
of our people,

398
00:37:48,085 --> 00:37:51,754
is self-preservation
not our chief responsibility?

399
00:37:53,790 --> 00:37:56,894
I have seen firsthand
how rampant xenophobia

400
00:37:56,961 --> 00:37:59,997
can destroy
a great civilization.

401
00:38:00,064 --> 00:38:02,867
If humanity is to have
a chance to thrive,

402
00:38:02,933 --> 00:38:06,836
we mustn't further
stoke its fears.

403
00:38:06,904 --> 00:38:09,406
I don't think anything
can stop that now.

404
00:38:09,473 --> 00:38:13,444
<i>The Daily Planet</i> is about to
publish the truth about me.

405
00:38:13,511 --> 00:38:15,012
Then we must stop them.

406
00:38:15,079 --> 00:38:17,414
J'onn, this world
is beginning to see me

407
00:38:17,481 --> 00:38:19,049
as some sort of champion.

408
00:38:20,117 --> 00:38:22,586
What if knowing
the truth about me

409
00:38:22,652 --> 00:38:23,888
is what turns this around,

410
00:38:23,954 --> 00:38:26,190
makes people
see things differently?

411
00:38:31,095 --> 00:38:33,330
You are an optimist, Kal-El.

412
00:38:33,898 --> 00:38:35,466
Like your father.

413
00:38:35,533 --> 00:38:37,700
Kal-El?

414
00:38:37,767 --> 00:38:40,404
Forgive me.
When I first became aware

415
00:38:40,471 --> 00:38:43,607
that you possess abilities
similar to my own,

416
00:38:43,673 --> 00:38:47,211
I assumed...
hoped you were Martian.

417
00:38:48,811 --> 00:38:51,781
I attempted a telepathic link
between our minds

418
00:38:51,848 --> 00:38:53,384
and in doing so,

419
00:38:53,450 --> 00:38:57,588
I inadvertently accessed
your memories of Krypton.

420
00:38:57,655 --> 00:38:59,623
I have no memories of Krypton.

421
00:38:59,689 --> 00:39:01,892
You were only an infant.

422
00:39:14,038 --> 00:39:16,440
I've never been able to
make this thing work.

423
00:39:27,885 --> 00:39:28,886
Is that...

424
00:39:28,953 --> 00:39:31,121
Your parents.

425
00:39:31,188 --> 00:39:33,123
I was able to pick up
some Kryptonian

426
00:39:33,190 --> 00:39:35,025
from your memories of them.

427
00:39:35,092 --> 00:39:38,795
I could teach you and help you
access those memories.

428
00:39:38,862 --> 00:39:40,464
But you should know
that the last thing

429
00:39:40,531 --> 00:39:44,935
your mother ever said to you
was that "to dwell in the past

430
00:39:45,002 --> 00:39:47,271
is to lose one's path."

431
00:39:52,176 --> 00:39:54,612
You have
a weighty decision to make.

432
00:39:54,678 --> 00:39:56,247
I'll leave you to it.

433
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:04,154
Wait.

434
00:40:05,356 --> 00:40:06,957
How will I find you?

435
00:40:07,024 --> 00:40:08,892
<i>Just listen.</i>

436
00:40:30,014 --> 00:40:31,814
Have you been up all night?

437
00:40:31,882 --> 00:40:33,984
Yeah, pretty much.

438
00:40:36,287 --> 00:40:37,221
Thank you.

439
00:40:37,288 --> 00:40:39,156
Twenty-four years
collecting dust

440
00:40:39,223 --> 00:40:41,859
and your new friend
gets it working in one try.

441
00:40:41,925 --> 00:40:43,360
So what is it?

442
00:40:43,427 --> 00:40:46,330
I don't know.
Some kind of historical record?

443
00:40:46,397 --> 00:40:49,099
I've barely
scratched the surface.

444
00:40:49,799 --> 00:40:51,201
It was incredible, Ma.

445
00:40:51,268 --> 00:40:53,470
I can't believe
I'll never get to see it.

446
00:40:55,072 --> 00:40:56,573
Maybe you will.

447
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:59,009
I'm beginning to think
you can do almost anything.

448
00:40:59,076 --> 00:41:02,179
Go anywhere. Only...

449
00:41:03,914 --> 00:41:04,915
What?

450
00:41:04,982 --> 00:41:06,550
You can go anywhere,

451
00:41:06,617 --> 00:41:10,554
but, as all those photos
posted all over the world show,

452
00:41:10,621 --> 00:41:12,890
your clothes can't.

453
00:41:21,031 --> 00:41:22,599
Did you make this?

454
00:41:22,666 --> 00:41:26,804
From the only fabric I know
that's been to outer space.

455
00:41:26,870 --> 00:41:29,606
You were swaddled in it
when we found you.

456
00:41:31,442 --> 00:41:34,244
Otherwise, I just copied
the design of that nice Batman

457
00:41:34,311 --> 00:41:36,880
I always see in the papers
at the checkout.

458
00:41:39,183 --> 00:41:40,617
You even did the cape.

459
00:41:40,684 --> 00:41:42,319
Now I don't know
if it'll hold up

460
00:41:42,386 --> 00:41:43,987
to the stress
you'll put it through,

461
00:41:44,054 --> 00:41:46,023
but we went through
16 bandsaw blades

462
00:41:46,090 --> 00:41:48,792
just to cut the fabric, so...

463
00:41:48,859 --> 00:41:51,061
Whattaya think?

464
00:41:51,128 --> 00:41:53,063
I think you're saying

465
00:41:53,130 --> 00:41:56,066
you want me to
tell the world who I really am.

466
00:41:56,667 --> 00:41:58,402
No, I'm saying

467
00:41:58,469 --> 00:42:02,106
we're not buying you any more
nice clothes to destroy.

468
00:42:03,707 --> 00:42:06,610
I love it, Ma. Thank you.

469
00:42:12,716 --> 00:42:14,351
It's out!

470
00:42:28,665 --> 00:42:30,100
Well?

471
00:42:30,167 --> 00:42:32,236
It's only part one.
She's teasing something big,

472
00:42:32,302 --> 00:42:35,205
but won't say what
until she interviews Lobo.

473
00:42:36,306 --> 00:42:38,475
I have to get back
to Metropolis.

474
00:42:38,542 --> 00:42:40,811
Maybe I can get her
to put the brakes on

475
00:42:40,879 --> 00:42:42,746
while I figure out what to do.

476
00:42:42,813 --> 00:42:44,715
What about your laundry?

477
00:42:44,782 --> 00:42:45,983
I'll get it later.

478
00:42:46,049 --> 00:42:48,552
Love the suit,
especially the cape!

479
00:42:50,954 --> 00:42:52,723
You added a cape?

480
00:42:52,790 --> 00:42:54,525
I think it looks cool.

481
00:43:02,533 --> 00:43:03,767
Stop it!

482
00:43:03,834 --> 00:43:07,638
Oh, don't like that one?
How 'bout this:

483
00:43:07,704 --> 00:43:10,441
"I met an old female in heat"

484
00:43:10,507 --> 00:43:14,645
Stop! Oh, my God!
What is wrong with you?

485
00:43:15,746 --> 00:43:17,815
Why don't I show ya?

486
00:43:17,882 --> 00:43:19,851
Come on, girlie.

487
00:43:33,063 --> 00:43:34,832
Good for you?

488
00:43:34,899 --> 00:43:36,500
Last question.

489
00:43:36,567 --> 00:43:38,635
You told me he's the only one
of his people here on Earth.

490
00:43:38,702 --> 00:43:40,103
Are there more on the way?

491
00:43:40,170 --> 00:43:43,841
Kryptonians? Yeah,
they're on their way all right.

492
00:43:43,908 --> 00:43:47,244
A whole army
comin' just for him.

493
00:43:47,311 --> 00:43:50,314
And those bloodthirsty
sons of bitches don't care

494
00:43:50,380 --> 00:43:53,083
who they gotta liquify
to get 'im.

495
00:43:54,618 --> 00:43:56,787
Nah!

496
00:43:56,855 --> 00:43:58,188
Jes' kiddin'.

497
00:43:58,255 --> 00:43:59,858
They're all dead,

498
00:43:59,924 --> 00:44:03,694
but you shoulda seen
the look on yer face though!

499
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:05,195
Classic!

500
00:44:10,834 --> 00:44:13,303
And then summa this.
And summa that.

501
00:44:13,370 --> 00:44:16,573
And then I give it a little
bit 'o wam-bam-boom...

502
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:19,276
Ugh. All right,
that's enough.

503
00:44:19,343 --> 00:44:20,945
That's enough.

504
00:44:21,011 --> 00:44:24,883
That wasn't even half
the Appellaxian mating dance.

505
00:44:24,949 --> 00:44:26,483
I don't blame ya,

506
00:44:26,550 --> 00:44:28,685
- I'm a whole lotta man...
- We're done here.

507
00:44:28,752 --> 00:44:30,354
Open up.

508
00:44:32,991 --> 00:44:34,057
What on Earth...

509
00:44:42,232 --> 00:44:45,302
Maybe you should run along
now, sweetybits.

510
00:45:48,599 --> 00:45:50,634
You...

511
00:45:50,701 --> 00:45:52,202
You did this!

512
00:45:52,269 --> 00:45:55,105
Hey, man,
I jes' work here.

513
00:45:55,172 --> 00:45:57,407
What's happening to me?

514
00:46:28,605 --> 00:46:29,539
Okay then.

515
00:46:33,610 --> 00:46:36,713
Now where'd those assholes
put my bike.

516
00:47:07,310 --> 00:47:08,812
Are you all right, Miss Lane?

517
00:47:11,415 --> 00:47:13,183
I think so.

518
00:47:13,250 --> 00:47:14,751
Paramedics are on their way.

519
00:47:16,120 --> 00:47:17,554
But I have to go after him.

520
00:47:19,756 --> 00:47:21,458
Superman?

521
00:47:21,525 --> 00:47:23,694
You're right about my origins,
Lois,

522
00:47:24,594 --> 00:47:26,263
but not my intentions.

523
00:47:27,330 --> 00:47:29,332
Please don't run your story.

524
00:47:29,399 --> 00:47:31,334
I should be the one
to tell the world.

525
00:47:35,472 --> 00:47:36,974
First you have to save it.

526
00:47:39,476 --> 00:47:41,244
We're overdue
for that interview.

527
00:47:43,948 --> 00:47:45,682
Maybe when this is over.

528
00:47:45,749 --> 00:47:46,817
I'll be there.

529
00:47:46,884 --> 00:47:48,285
No games, I promise.

530
00:47:50,587 --> 00:47:53,757
And Superman...
Don't let him touch you.

531
00:48:28,926 --> 00:48:30,327
What the hell?

532
00:48:33,463 --> 00:48:34,798
Let them go.

533
00:48:51,082 --> 00:48:52,415
Nice work.

534
00:48:52,482 --> 00:48:54,518
Now let's get these
people to safety before...

535
00:49:00,191 --> 00:49:01,825
Go! I'll try to hold him back.

536
00:49:17,942 --> 00:49:21,913
So... much... power!

537
00:49:34,324 --> 00:49:37,661
Oh, yes...

538
00:49:38,728 --> 00:49:40,463
Yes...

539
00:49:41,132 --> 00:49:43,366
More...

540
00:49:49,606 --> 00:49:51,075
How are we doing J'onn?

541
00:50:06,157 --> 00:50:07,824
Yes...

542
00:50:08,259 --> 00:50:10,027
Yes...

543
00:50:13,931 --> 00:50:14,966
Kent.

544
00:50:15,967 --> 00:50:17,068
The intern...

545
00:50:18,302 --> 00:50:21,138
Or is it Kal-El?

546
00:50:30,982 --> 00:50:33,416
No, don't touch him.

547
00:50:41,558 --> 00:50:43,526
J'onn J'onzz...

548
00:50:43,593 --> 00:50:45,263
the manhunter...

549
00:50:52,602 --> 00:50:54,005
Stop this.

550
00:50:55,006 --> 00:50:56,506
Please.

551
00:50:59,076 --> 00:51:01,444
No. No, please.

552
00:51:04,781 --> 00:51:05,883
Ahhh.

553
00:51:23,700 --> 00:51:25,468
Oh!

554
00:52:23,793 --> 00:52:25,662
Clark!

555
00:52:25,729 --> 00:52:27,064
Hey, Clark!

556
00:52:29,733 --> 00:52:31,801
- Clark?
- It was unlocked.

557
00:52:32,569 --> 00:52:33,971
What happened?

558
00:52:34,038 --> 00:52:35,306
I, uh...

559
00:52:35,373 --> 00:52:36,673
I broke the glass.

560
00:52:36,740 --> 00:52:38,608
No kidding.

561
00:52:38,675 --> 00:52:40,077
I mean, what were you doing

562
00:52:40,144 --> 00:52:42,213
in the middle
of the attack yesterday?

563
00:52:42,279 --> 00:52:43,280
How did you know?

564
00:52:44,848 --> 00:52:46,484
You gave a statement
to the police.

565
00:52:46,549 --> 00:52:47,852
You know, Clark,

566
00:52:47,918 --> 00:52:49,552
there are much easier ways
to get the story.

567
00:52:50,388 --> 00:52:51,255
There are?

568
00:52:51,922 --> 00:52:52,822
No!

569
00:52:52,890 --> 00:52:54,125
Actually running in there

570
00:52:54,191 --> 00:52:55,558
was exactly what
I should have done.

571
00:52:56,494 --> 00:52:58,095
Why are you here?

572
00:52:58,162 --> 00:53:00,830
Perry read the police report
and asked me to check on you.

573
00:53:02,632 --> 00:53:05,835
Actually he ordered me
to fire you

574
00:53:05,903 --> 00:53:07,570
for not showing up today but

575
00:53:07,637 --> 00:53:09,773
I think I got
the translation right.

576
00:53:16,414 --> 00:53:18,015
Well, did you see him
in action?

577
00:53:20,617 --> 00:53:22,053
Who?

578
00:53:22,119 --> 00:53:23,220
The Superman.

579
00:53:23,287 --> 00:53:24,288
Oh.

580
00:53:24,355 --> 00:53:25,523
Yeah.

581
00:53:25,588 --> 00:53:27,124
And the Martian Manhunter.

582
00:53:27,191 --> 00:53:29,726
The Martian Manhunter?
That's terrible.

583
00:53:29,793 --> 00:53:31,761
But it's your story so...

584
00:53:32,629 --> 00:53:34,564
It burnt him alive, Lois.

585
00:53:35,299 --> 00:53:36,867
That Parasite thing.

586
00:53:37,935 --> 00:53:39,904
I can still hear the screams.

587
00:53:41,539 --> 00:53:42,973
And the Superman?

588
00:53:49,646 --> 00:53:51,215
I think he's dead, too.

589
00:53:56,187 --> 00:53:57,321
Lois, this job...

590
00:53:59,323 --> 00:54:00,858
Not what you expected?

591
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:04,528
It's so much harder...

592
00:54:04,594 --> 00:54:07,531
this whole story.

593
00:54:07,597 --> 00:54:09,033
I'd only just gotten started

594
00:54:09,100 --> 00:54:11,202
and now I think
I may have lost it.

595
00:54:12,203 --> 00:54:13,170
Maybe for good.

596
00:54:15,339 --> 00:54:16,273
Clark.

597
00:54:17,541 --> 00:54:18,808
You've chosen a job

598
00:54:18,876 --> 00:54:19,944
that can put you face to face

599
00:54:20,010 --> 00:54:22,279
to some pretty bad stuff.

600
00:54:22,346 --> 00:54:25,715
You try and make a difference
and fight for truth,

601
00:54:26,150 --> 00:54:27,184
justice,

602
00:54:27,251 --> 00:54:28,685
and sometimes
you get smacked down.

603
00:54:28,751 --> 00:54:30,820
But let me tell you,
Clark Kent.

604
00:54:30,888 --> 00:54:32,289
If this is what you want,

605
00:54:32,356 --> 00:54:33,656
if it's who you are,

606
00:54:33,723 --> 00:54:35,259
then you have to do it.

607
00:54:35,960 --> 00:54:37,595
But this job takes guts.

608
00:54:37,660 --> 00:54:39,497
It takes risk.

609
00:54:39,563 --> 00:54:41,298
And maybe
one of those risks is,

610
00:54:41,365 --> 00:54:42,900
when you feel overwhelmed

611
00:54:42,967 --> 00:54:44,301
to open yourself up

612
00:54:44,368 --> 00:54:46,703
and ask someone
smarter than you for help.

613
00:54:48,606 --> 00:54:50,707
Someone smarter than me?

614
00:54:50,773 --> 00:54:52,775
I bet, they're closer
than you think.

615
00:54:54,644 --> 00:54:56,046
You're totally right.

616
00:54:57,148 --> 00:54:58,048
Perfect.

617
00:54:59,049 --> 00:55:00,650
First, give me your source.

618
00:55:01,952 --> 00:55:04,654
Lois, did you come here
to steal my story?

619
00:55:04,721 --> 00:55:05,688
What?

620
00:55:05,755 --> 00:55:07,757
No! No!

621
00:55:08,926 --> 00:55:12,062
I thought that
we would share it.

622
00:55:12,129 --> 00:55:13,696
You know what,
thanks for coming, Lois.

623
00:55:13,763 --> 00:55:14,865
Really, thank you.
Tell Perry

624
00:55:14,932 --> 00:55:16,901
he can't fire me
because I quit.

625
00:55:16,967 --> 00:55:19,136
For now, sorry, I got to go.

626
00:55:19,203 --> 00:55:20,703
What? Where?

627
00:55:20,770 --> 00:55:21,939
To talk to someone smart.

628
00:55:22,006 --> 00:55:23,908
I was going to split
the byline.

629
00:55:42,660 --> 00:55:44,228
Is it still Halloween?

630
00:55:46,230 --> 00:55:47,264
No.

631
00:55:47,331 --> 00:55:48,566
Let's just say,
it's more practical

632
00:55:48,632 --> 00:55:50,267
than cargos and aviator caps.

633
00:55:52,303 --> 00:55:53,736
Ah-ha.

634
00:55:53,803 --> 00:55:55,139
And what's the "S" for?

635
00:55:56,440 --> 00:55:57,341
Superman.

636
00:55:59,276 --> 00:56:00,277
Right.

637
00:56:00,344 --> 00:56:02,845
Well, Superman,
what's this about?

638
00:56:04,348 --> 00:56:05,316
I need your help.

639
00:56:06,617 --> 00:56:08,185
I've seen you in action,
flyboy.

640
00:56:08,252 --> 00:56:10,254
You're as powerful
as a locomotive.

641
00:56:11,388 --> 00:56:12,590
More.

642
00:56:12,656 --> 00:56:14,024
Usually.

643
00:56:14,091 --> 00:56:17,161
So how could I possibly
help you?

644
00:56:18,429 --> 00:56:19,930
I need to get into space.

645
00:56:20,397 --> 00:56:22,166
Fast.

646
00:56:22,233 --> 00:56:24,902
Not the most practical
getaway plan.

647
00:56:28,572 --> 00:56:29,839
The sun!

648
00:56:29,907 --> 00:56:32,343
It's like a power source
for you, isn't it?

649
00:56:32,409 --> 00:56:34,378
And if you need help
getting closer to it,

650
00:56:34,445 --> 00:56:35,713
that means you're...

651
00:56:35,778 --> 00:56:36,914
powerless.

652
00:56:37,681 --> 00:56:38,882
Interesting.

653
00:56:40,817 --> 00:56:42,620
You've seen the news reports.

654
00:56:42,686 --> 00:56:45,522
This creature, this Parasite.

655
00:56:46,724 --> 00:56:48,492
It killed my friend.

656
00:56:48,559 --> 00:56:51,761
Now everyone is in danger
and I can't stop it.

657
00:56:51,828 --> 00:56:53,497
Not like this.

658
00:56:53,564 --> 00:56:54,764
Can you help me?

659
00:56:55,499 --> 00:56:57,234
Of course I can, but...

660
00:56:59,003 --> 00:57:00,404
How much do you want?

661
00:57:01,372 --> 00:57:03,374
Money? I have money.

662
00:57:03,440 --> 00:57:05,609
No, I don't want anything
but to help.

663
00:57:05,676 --> 00:57:09,046
It can only look good
to the parole board.

664
00:57:09,113 --> 00:57:11,415
But I can't help you
from in here.

665
00:57:11,482 --> 00:57:12,916
I have to get out.

666
00:57:12,983 --> 00:57:15,386
That's not going to happen,
Luthor.

667
00:57:15,452 --> 00:57:16,854
Relax.

668
00:57:16,920 --> 00:57:18,322
I can get a day pass.

669
00:57:19,657 --> 00:57:20,891
A day pass?

670
00:57:20,958 --> 00:57:23,360
That's not even a thing.

671
00:57:24,528 --> 00:57:25,795
Wanna bet?

672
00:57:41,278 --> 00:57:42,513
Kaylie!

673
00:57:42,579 --> 00:57:43,647
Breakfast!

674
00:57:43,714 --> 00:57:46,250
I can't find my shoe, Mommy!

675
00:58:14,678 --> 00:58:16,380
Ahhh!

676
00:58:19,249 --> 00:58:20,918
Kaylie, what's wrong?

677
00:58:46,243 --> 00:58:47,945
It's good to be home.

678
00:58:48,512 --> 00:58:50,013
You live here?

679
00:58:50,080 --> 00:58:51,215
Practically.

680
00:58:54,418 --> 00:58:56,420
So this "Parasite" zaps
your powers,

681
00:58:56,487 --> 00:58:58,522
now you're a filthy mortal
like the rest of us.

682
00:58:58,589 --> 00:58:59,590
Do I have it?

683
00:59:00,524 --> 00:59:01,625
Something like that.

684
00:59:01,692 --> 00:59:03,093
I still have my abilities

685
00:59:03,160 --> 00:59:04,661
but they are very weak.

686
00:59:04,728 --> 00:59:05,929
Some more than others.

687
00:59:05,996 --> 00:59:07,231
It may be slow going,

688
00:59:07,297 --> 00:59:09,133
but you'll return
to full strength.

689
00:59:11,135 --> 00:59:12,369
Eventually.

690
00:59:12,436 --> 00:59:14,838
There's no time.
I need a jump start.

691
00:59:14,905 --> 00:59:17,040
Can you shoot me
into orbit or not?

692
00:59:17,107 --> 00:59:19,176
I'm not launching you
into space.

693
00:59:19,243 --> 00:59:20,310
Why not?

694
00:59:20,377 --> 00:59:22,746
Because you are right now
a fragile egg.

695
00:59:22,813 --> 00:59:24,248
Untrained and unprepared

696
00:59:24,314 --> 00:59:26,517
for the grueling reality
of space flight.

697
00:59:26,583 --> 00:59:29,153
Unless your secret identity
is an astronaut.

698
00:59:30,754 --> 00:59:32,589
Didn't think so.

699
00:59:32,656 --> 00:59:33,757
Anyway, don't worry.

700
00:59:33,824 --> 00:59:35,125
I have a plan.

701
00:59:42,433 --> 00:59:44,968
This is from S.T.A.R. labs.
How did you get this?

702
00:59:45,035 --> 00:59:46,203
Yup.

703
00:59:46,270 --> 00:59:48,238
There's your problem.

704
00:59:49,440 --> 00:59:50,407
The janitor...

705
00:59:50,474 --> 00:59:52,676
That grenade
was an organic EMP,

706
00:59:52,743 --> 00:59:54,011
designed to absorb

707
00:59:54,077 --> 00:59:56,346
all the power
it comes in contact with.

708
00:59:56,413 --> 00:59:59,082
It's almost like it
melded with the janitor's DNA

709
00:59:59,149 --> 01:00:01,585
and turned him into
some kind of energy vampire.

710
01:00:03,922 --> 01:00:06,123
It takes everything.

711
01:00:06,190 --> 01:00:07,926
How do you fight
something like that?

712
01:00:07,991 --> 01:00:09,726
I just told you.

713
01:00:09,793 --> 01:00:12,329
"It takes everything."

714
01:00:12,396 --> 01:00:14,598
It's like buying a company,
when you absorb the assets,

715
01:00:14,665 --> 01:00:17,534
you also absorb
the vulnerabilities.

716
01:00:17,601 --> 01:00:21,104
If we can employ those,
we can defeat it.

717
01:00:21,171 --> 01:00:24,741
So... what are Superman's
weaknesses?

718
01:00:24,808 --> 01:00:26,743
I don't know. I'm not sure
if I ever had any.

719
01:00:26,810 --> 01:00:27,912
I wasn't talking to you.

720
01:00:35,018 --> 01:00:36,019
Lobo.

721
01:00:36,086 --> 01:00:37,087
Even on the inside,

722
01:00:37,154 --> 01:00:38,655
I like to keep close tabs

723
01:00:38,722 --> 01:00:40,390
on all the happenings
about town.

724
01:00:40,457 --> 01:00:42,961
Once the Czarnian here
was liberated from the cell

725
01:00:43,026 --> 01:00:44,528
you put him in
at S.T.A.R. Labs...

726
01:00:46,263 --> 01:00:48,098
Thanks fer that, by the way.

727
01:00:48,165 --> 01:00:50,000
it was an easy matter
for one of my surrogates

728
01:00:50,067 --> 01:00:51,535
to track down
the bounty hunter

729
01:00:51,602 --> 01:00:52,904
and... cut a deal.

730
01:00:52,971 --> 01:00:54,204
A deal?

731
01:00:54,271 --> 01:00:56,173
You might say
I bought the company.

732
01:00:56,240 --> 01:00:59,610
Lobo is now my asset...

733
01:00:59,676 --> 01:01:01,478
...or vulnerability.

734
01:01:01,545 --> 01:01:02,579
Time will tell.

735
01:01:03,982 --> 01:01:05,315
The ring.

736
01:01:05,382 --> 01:01:08,018
Carved from irradiated remains
of Krypton.

737
01:01:08,085 --> 01:01:10,420
I don't know how or why,
but it weakened me.

738
01:01:10,855 --> 01:01:11,788
A lot.

739
01:01:14,825 --> 01:01:18,295
That's what we use to fight off
the superpowered Parasite.

740
01:01:26,004 --> 01:01:27,972
Extraordinary amount
of radiation

741
01:01:28,038 --> 01:01:29,673
for something so minuscule.

742
01:01:30,875 --> 01:01:32,209
Harmless to humans,

743
01:01:32,276 --> 01:01:34,545
but having absorbed
your powers...

744
01:01:34,611 --> 01:01:35,746
this might work.

745
01:01:38,448 --> 01:01:40,517
We just need
to get its attention.

746
01:01:45,122 --> 01:01:46,256
Mmm,

747
01:01:46,323 --> 01:01:49,126
somethin' I like
about this place.

748
01:01:49,192 --> 01:01:50,895
This plant powers
the entire city.

749
01:01:50,962 --> 01:01:52,262
Where is everybody?

750
01:01:55,332 --> 01:01:58,835
I called in a bomb threat
before we left.

751
01:01:58,903 --> 01:02:00,771
You shouldn't lie about bombs.

752
01:02:03,240 --> 01:02:04,675
I didn't.

753
01:02:28,765 --> 01:02:31,234
Looks like Lex was able
to boost the output.

754
01:02:32,003 --> 01:02:33,236
Now we wait.

755
01:02:58,930 --> 01:03:00,098
Wait's over.

756
01:03:00,163 --> 01:03:02,566
It's ass-whoopin'
time.

757
01:03:15,046 --> 01:03:16,114
Here we go.

758
01:03:16,179 --> 01:03:17,514
Feeling any stronger?

759
01:03:17,581 --> 01:03:18,649
Let's see.

760
01:03:43,206 --> 01:03:45,943
Well? Am I paying you
to stand around?

761
01:03:46,010 --> 01:03:49,479
Yeah, yeah, don't get
your panties in a twist.

762
01:03:53,684 --> 01:03:55,652
Hell, yeah!

763
01:04:12,036 --> 01:04:14,172
Whoo...

764
01:04:22,245 --> 01:04:24,448
Go down, damn it!

765
01:04:28,052 --> 01:04:30,320
The ring, it's not working.

766
01:04:30,387 --> 01:04:31,688
It looks like there's a limit

767
01:04:31,755 --> 01:04:33,925
to how long the Parasite
can retain your power...

768
01:04:34,825 --> 01:04:35,860
and weakness.

769
01:04:42,232 --> 01:04:43,300
Lobo!

770
01:04:44,869 --> 01:04:46,470
Eat... shit...

771
01:04:47,370 --> 01:04:48,839
bastich...

772
01:04:48,906 --> 01:04:49,874
No.

773
01:05:10,962 --> 01:05:11,863
No.

774
01:05:54,304 --> 01:05:56,107
They have to hold their fire!

775
01:05:56,174 --> 01:05:57,641
It's only
making him stronger!

776
01:05:57,707 --> 01:06:00,278
I'll make a call,
but we need Lobo's ring.

777
01:06:00,343 --> 01:06:02,512
If this thing absorbs
all the power from the plant,

778
01:06:02,579 --> 01:06:04,514
it'll become
too strong to take down.

779
01:06:04,581 --> 01:06:06,316
Then he can't
make it to the plant.

780
01:06:06,383 --> 01:06:07,784
What are you going to do?

781
01:06:14,258 --> 01:06:15,692
Give him a weakness.

782
01:06:19,130 --> 01:06:21,299
Hey! Want some more?

783
01:06:21,364 --> 01:06:22,732
I'm right here!

784
01:07:15,418 --> 01:07:17,520
Troupe. T-R-O...

785
01:07:17,587 --> 01:07:20,291
Yeah. Yeah. I'm still
holding for the Pentagon.

786
01:07:20,358 --> 01:07:21,926
What? Are you...

787
01:07:21,993 --> 01:07:24,195
That's 45 minutes
on hold, Lane.

788
01:07:24,262 --> 01:07:25,897
I was almost through!

789
01:07:25,963 --> 01:07:27,664
City is on lockdown. We're not
allowed to leave the building.

790
01:07:27,731 --> 01:07:29,733
- But...
- Yeah?

791
01:07:29,799 --> 01:07:31,735
The story is out there.

792
01:07:51,122 --> 01:07:52,489
Need more power?

793
01:07:52,555 --> 01:07:53,925
Well, come and get it!

794
01:08:18,548 --> 01:08:20,184
Lex!

795
01:08:20,251 --> 01:08:21,953
See, here's my problem.

796
01:08:22,954 --> 01:08:24,821
The Parasite
is very powerful.

797
01:08:24,889 --> 01:08:28,025
But the Superman
is also very powerful.

798
01:08:28,092 --> 01:08:30,493
Lex, no!

799
01:08:33,530 --> 01:08:35,465
Right now, the man
with the ring

800
01:08:35,532 --> 01:08:37,667
is the most
powerful of all.

801
01:08:37,734 --> 01:08:39,971
So, which is
the bigger threat?

802
01:08:44,141 --> 01:08:48,611
A simple janitor transformed into
a monster by futuristic tech?

803
01:08:48,678 --> 01:08:50,513
Or the super-powered alien

804
01:08:51,315 --> 01:08:52,849
lying to humanity

805
01:08:52,917 --> 01:08:54,986
masquerading
as one of us?

806
01:09:00,490 --> 01:09:02,426
Oh, hell.

807
01:09:02,492 --> 01:09:04,996
I'll just make
you both my slaves.

808
01:09:28,853 --> 01:09:31,654
Magnifying Pulse Rifle.

809
01:09:31,721 --> 01:09:34,025
LexCorp security issue.

810
01:09:34,091 --> 01:09:35,359
Pretty sweet, huh?

811
01:09:50,673 --> 01:09:52,043
Are you all right?

812
01:09:54,844 --> 01:09:56,447
But, the Parasite...

813
01:09:56,514 --> 01:09:58,015
I saw it kill you.

814
01:09:59,749 --> 01:10:02,086
You saw what
I wanted it to see.

815
01:10:25,976 --> 01:10:28,913
Those people
are in grave danger.

816
01:10:40,224 --> 01:10:41,559
That ring will kill you.

817
01:10:41,624 --> 01:10:44,161
I don't know any other way.

818
01:10:49,400 --> 01:10:50,700
Find one.

819
01:11:09,320 --> 01:11:11,388
Choppers are grounded.
TV crews can't get in.

820
01:11:38,916 --> 01:11:41,018
Lois Lane, live at the scene.

821
01:11:41,085 --> 01:11:42,586
We're on foot
and we have a phone,

822
01:11:42,652 --> 01:11:44,088
so we're live-streaming.

823
01:11:44,155 --> 01:11:46,157
The military have tried
to keep the crowd back,

824
01:11:46,223 --> 01:11:48,192
but at this point, we've
got a lot of angry people

825
01:11:48,259 --> 01:11:49,894
who are ready
to make a stand

826
01:11:49,960 --> 01:11:52,863
against what they see as
an extra-terrestrial threat.

827
01:11:55,732 --> 01:11:58,668
Superman may be
the only thing

828
01:11:58,735 --> 01:12:01,005
that stands between
the people of Metropolis

829
01:12:01,071 --> 01:12:02,940
and total annihilation.

830
01:12:03,007 --> 01:12:05,176
But, if the eyewitness
reports are true,

831
01:12:05,242 --> 01:12:07,144
the Parasite
can absorb our strength,

832
01:12:07,211 --> 01:12:09,812
knowledge, our feelings,
our essence...

833
01:12:12,682 --> 01:12:14,051
Feelings?

834
01:12:14,885 --> 01:12:16,420
My essence.

835
01:12:21,358 --> 01:12:22,593
Rudy!

836
01:12:22,660 --> 01:12:24,028
Rudy Jones!

837
01:12:24,094 --> 01:12:26,096
I know you're still
in there, Rudy.

838
01:12:30,568 --> 01:12:32,136
I know you remember me.

839
01:12:33,571 --> 01:12:36,373
And I know if you've
absorbed everything about me,

840
01:12:36,440 --> 01:12:39,910
then you haven't just gotten
just my powers or my knowledge.

841
01:12:39,977 --> 01:12:42,812
You've gotten my heart.

842
01:12:42,880 --> 01:12:45,683
My love for my family
and friends.

843
01:12:45,748 --> 01:12:47,618
My need to keep them safe.

844
01:12:47,685 --> 01:12:51,021
Rudy, you are a combat veteran
who served with honor.

845
01:12:55,426 --> 01:12:58,429
A proud father
of one in first grade.

846
01:12:59,430 --> 01:13:00,564
<i>Kaylie, right?</i>

847
01:13:00,631 --> 01:13:02,066
<i>And another on the way.</i>

848
01:13:03,300 --> 01:13:05,369
I'm sorry this
happened to you.

849
01:13:06,237 --> 01:13:07,871
But, whatever else you are,

850
01:13:07,938 --> 01:13:10,374
Rudy, whatever you've become,

851
01:13:10,441 --> 01:13:12,910
I know you're still
the same as me.

852
01:13:14,144 --> 01:13:16,947
You don't really want
anyone to get hurt.

853
01:13:19,984 --> 01:13:21,952
What are you doing?

854
01:13:22,019 --> 01:13:24,088
Stop! All of you!

855
01:13:25,822 --> 01:13:27,790
He's not the alien.

856
01:13:27,858 --> 01:13:29,159
I am.

857
01:13:31,428 --> 01:13:33,197
I see the anger in you.

858
01:13:33,264 --> 01:13:37,901
But, the truth is,
you don't hate aliens.

859
01:13:37,968 --> 01:13:40,971
You're scared,
terrified of them,

860
01:13:41,038 --> 01:13:42,973
even when they're not there.

861
01:13:44,241 --> 01:13:45,842
This man's name
is Rudy Jones.

862
01:13:45,909 --> 01:13:48,479
He's the victim
of a terrible accident.

863
01:13:49,413 --> 01:13:51,615
But, he was born here.

864
01:13:51,682 --> 01:13:53,050
He's one of you.

865
01:13:55,586 --> 01:13:57,054
And so am I.

866
01:14:00,457 --> 01:14:04,261
I was born in the last days
of a dying planet.

867
01:14:04,328 --> 01:14:06,829
My parents' hope was that
they had sent me to a world

868
01:14:06,897 --> 01:14:09,033
where I would be
safe and protected.

869
01:14:09,099 --> 01:14:11,268
But, the price
of that protection,

870
01:14:11,335 --> 01:14:14,405
silence about who
and what I really am,

871
01:14:14,471 --> 01:14:18,008
while others like me
face persecution, or worse...

872
01:14:19,343 --> 01:14:22,179
I was scared,
but I'm not scared anymore.

873
01:14:25,883 --> 01:14:28,252
My name is Kal-El of Krypton.

874
01:14:29,153 --> 01:14:30,521
And I come in peace.

875
01:15:06,357 --> 01:15:08,392
Die, you bastard!

876
01:15:11,662 --> 01:15:13,397
Stop!

877
01:15:17,368 --> 01:15:18,469
Rudy, wait!

878
01:15:56,640 --> 01:15:59,543
Oh, God.

879
01:16:13,791 --> 01:16:16,360
You should have let me
turn the damn thing off.

880
01:16:18,929 --> 01:16:21,398
Superman!
The reactor!

881
01:18:02,967 --> 01:18:04,268
Rudy!

882
01:19:32,656 --> 01:19:34,458
Is that
really you this time?

883
01:19:34,524 --> 01:19:36,493
Or is it
a telepathic trick?

884
01:19:38,930 --> 01:19:40,898
I've apologized already.

885
01:19:40,965 --> 01:19:43,901
It bought me the time
I needed to recuperate

886
01:19:43,968 --> 01:19:46,803
so I could save your ass.

887
01:19:48,873 --> 01:19:50,140
Better.

888
01:19:51,408 --> 01:19:55,145
But you still
sound like a dweeb.

889
01:19:55,212 --> 01:19:57,147
You could've mentioned
the immortality.

890
01:19:58,448 --> 01:20:00,817
I like to keep
people guessing.

891
01:20:03,754 --> 01:20:05,522
Three aliens.

892
01:20:05,589 --> 01:20:07,491
The last surviving members

893
01:20:07,557 --> 01:20:09,826
of each of our people.

894
01:20:09,894 --> 01:20:13,497
Of course I killed
all my peoples myself.

895
01:20:13,563 --> 01:20:15,699
So, why do I give a shit?

896
01:20:20,837 --> 01:20:22,974
Nah.

897
01:20:23,041 --> 01:20:26,510
Just kidding. You should
have seen your face, though.

898
01:20:33,517 --> 01:20:36,020
You know those are
just stories, right?

899
01:20:36,087 --> 01:20:38,056
Every rat bastard I hunt

900
01:20:38,122 --> 01:20:40,190
is the last of his people.

901
01:20:40,257 --> 01:20:42,994
Something you say
to keep the bounty high.

902
01:20:43,061 --> 01:20:46,229
Are you saying there are
other Martians out there?

903
01:20:46,864 --> 01:20:48,832
Hell yeah!

904
01:20:48,900 --> 01:20:50,902
Seen 'em myself.

905
01:20:50,968 --> 01:20:53,670
Might even be
a Kryptonian, or two.

906
01:20:57,041 --> 01:20:58,642
All right, ladies.

907
01:20:58,709 --> 01:21:01,445
I gotta take
a big old space dump

908
01:21:01,511 --> 01:21:03,981
and I don't do it no place
but my own.

909
01:21:04,048 --> 01:21:05,415
So...

910
01:21:05,983 --> 01:21:07,784
smell you later!

911
01:21:15,659 --> 01:21:17,828
I really hope
he doesn't come back.

912
01:21:20,363 --> 01:21:22,033
You should go.

913
01:21:22,100 --> 01:21:23,266
Follow him.

914
01:21:24,367 --> 01:21:25,702
Find your people.

915
01:21:28,305 --> 01:21:29,840
And you, Kal-El.

916
01:21:35,812 --> 01:21:37,181
It's Superman.

917
01:21:37,247 --> 01:21:38,849
My people are right here.

918
01:21:47,058 --> 01:21:48,358
You...

919
01:21:48,425 --> 01:21:50,460
You couldn't meet me
over by the stairs?

920
01:21:50,527 --> 01:21:52,662
We're losing
valuable interview time.

921
01:21:52,729 --> 01:21:54,798
Sorry, Ms. Lane. Not today.

922
01:21:56,901 --> 01:21:58,035
Call me to reschedule.

923
01:22:22,359 --> 01:22:23,827
Way to go, Superman!

924
01:22:25,963 --> 01:22:27,899
So, how was
the interview, Lois?

925
01:22:29,666 --> 01:22:31,568
You know what I told you
about power moves, Clark?

926
01:22:31,635 --> 01:22:33,770
Well, I was right.
They really do work.

927
01:22:33,837 --> 01:22:35,873
Has anybody
seen my calendar?

928
01:22:46,692 --> 01:22:51,692

00:00:35,368 --> 00:00:37,103
(knocking)

2
00:00:37,103 --> 00:00:37,970
Come in!

3
00:00:39,272 --> 00:00:41,441
Good morning, Mrs. Ricardo.

4
00:00:41,441 --> 00:00:42,742
Good morning, Miss Lewis.
Come in.

5
00:00:42,742 --> 00:00:43,609
Oh, thank you.

6
00:00:43,609 --> 00:00:45,344
How's everything down in your
apartment?

7
00:00:45,344 --> 00:00:46,646
Oh, fine, fine.

8
00:00:46,646 --> 00:00:48,815
Help yourself to a cup of coffee.

9
00:00:48,815 --> 00:00:49,682
Oh, I'd like some.

10
00:00:49,682 --> 00:00:50,983
It's chilly out.

11
00:00:50,983 --> 00:00:51,851
Yes, it is.

12
00:00:51,851 --> 00:00:55,755
(juicer whirring noisily)

13
00:00:58,357 --> 00:01:00,093
Mrs. Ricardo.

14
00:01:00,093 --> 00:01:01,828
Mrs. Ricardo...

15
00:01:01,828 --> 00:01:04,430
(loudly): Mrs. Ricardo, could I
speak...

16
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:05,731
Oh.

17
00:01:05,731 --> 00:01:07,900
Could I speak to you for a minute?

18
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:09,635
Oh, surely, what's on your mind?

19
00:01:09,635 --> 00:01:11,370
Well, I, um...

20
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:14,407
I wanted to ask you a big favor.

21
00:01:14,841 --> 00:01:17,009
It's about a, hmm...

22
00:01:17,009 --> 00:01:18,311
m-a-n.

23
00:01:18,311 --> 00:01:20,913
M-a-n?

24
00:01:20,913 --> 00:01:21,781
Oh, a man.

25
00:01:22,215 --> 00:01:23,950
Ooh, shh!

26
00:01:24,383 --> 00:01:26,986
Well, is it any special m-a-n?

27
00:01:26,986 --> 00:01:28,721
It's mister, um...

28
00:01:28,721 --> 00:01:30,456
Ritter.

29
00:01:30,456 --> 00:01:32,625
Mr. Ritter, the grocery man?

30
00:01:33,493 --> 00:01:36,963
Oh, why, Miss Lewis, I believe you're
blushing.

31
00:01:36,963 --> 00:01:39,999
I know, I know.

32
00:01:39,999 --> 00:01:44,337
Oh, oh, Mrs. Ricardo, I don't mind
telling you

33
00:01:44,337 --> 00:01:49,108
that as far as I'm concerned, Mr.
Ritter is the bee's knees.

34
00:01:49,108 --> 00:01:52,145
(laughing)

35
00:01:52,145 --> 00:01:53,446
What's the matter?

36
00:01:53,446 --> 00:01:54,313
Oh, nothing.

37
00:01:54,313 --> 00:01:56,916
It's just that I never expected you

38
00:01:56,916 --> 00:01:58,651
to think things like that.

39
00:01:58,651 --> 00:02:01,687
Ooh, ooh, I do!

40
00:02:02,989 --> 00:02:05,158
Well, you know the old saying

41
00:02:05,158 --> 00:02:07,760
"Just because there's snow on the
roof

42
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:10,796
doesn't mean there's no fire in the
furnace."

43
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:18,171
Well, well, well, here this big
romance is going on

44
00:02:18,171 --> 00:02:21,641
between you and Mr. Ritter and I
never knew about it.

45
00:02:21,641 --> 00:02:22,942
There's somebody else

46
00:02:22,942 --> 00:02:24,677
that doesn't know about it.

47
00:02:24,677 --> 00:02:25,545
Who?

48
00:02:25,545 --> 00:02:26,846
Mr. Ritter.

49
00:02:28,581 --> 00:02:30,316
Mr. Ritter?

50
00:02:30,316 --> 00:02:33,352
To Mr. Ritter, I'm just a box of
groceries

51
00:02:33,352 --> 00:02:35,087
twice a week.

52
00:02:35,087 --> 00:02:38,124
Oh... well, why don't you do
something about it?

53
00:02:38,124 --> 00:02:39,859
I'm going to, I'm going to.

54
00:02:39,859 --> 00:02:41,594
I want to invite him

55
00:02:41,594 --> 00:02:44,630
to a little intimate supper for two
in my apartment.

56
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:45,498
Oh.

57
00:02:45,498 --> 00:02:46,799
Oh, but I need your help.

58
00:02:46,799 --> 00:02:49,835
Oh, what do you want me to do, hold
him for you?

59
00:02:50,269 --> 00:02:51,571
Oh, no, no, no!

60
00:02:51,571 --> 00:02:54,173
I want you to give him this.

61
00:02:54,173 --> 00:02:56,776
It's... oh, it's a little dirty.

62
00:02:56,776 --> 00:02:59,812
I've been carrying it around for five
years.

63
00:03:01,113 --> 00:03:03,282
Five years?

64
00:03:03,282 --> 00:03:06,319
I've been carrying the blowtorch for
Mr. Ritter

65
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:08,487
for five years.

66
00:03:08,487 --> 00:03:11,090
Well, I better give this to him
today.

67
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:12,391
Is breakfast ready?

68
00:03:12,391 --> 00:03:14,126
Oh, hello, Mrs. Lewis.

69
00:03:14,126 --> 00:03:16,295
Good morning, Mr. Ricardo.

70
00:03:16,295 --> 00:03:17,163
Good morning.

71
00:03:17,163 --> 00:03:19,332
Oh, well...

72
00:03:19,332 --> 00:03:21,500
I guess I'll be running along.

73
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:22,368
Toodle-oo!

74
00:03:22,368 --> 00:03:23,669
Good-bye, dear.

75
00:03:23,669 --> 00:03:24,537
Toodle-oo.

76
00:03:26,706 --> 00:03:28,441
What's on Grandma Lewis's mind?

77
00:03:28,441 --> 00:03:31,043
Listen, don't let Grandma Lewis fool
you.

78
00:03:31,043 --> 00:03:32,345
Yes, sir.

79
00:03:32,345 --> 00:03:34,513
You never know what's in a box by the
wrapper.

80
00:03:34,513 --> 00:03:38,417
Well, really, I didn't even look at
her wrapper.

81
00:03:38,417 --> 00:03:39,285
I didn't mean that.

82
00:03:39,285 --> 00:03:41,020
It's just an expression.

83
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:44,490
It means just because there isn't any
fire on her roof

84
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:46,659
that there is no snow in her furnace.

85
00:03:49,695 --> 00:03:50,997
What?

86
00:03:50,997 --> 00:03:53,165
Sounded better when she said it.

87
00:03:53,165 --> 00:03:54,033
Yeah.

88
00:03:57,503 --> 00:04:00,106
Honestly, Ricky, it's the cutest
thing.

89
00:04:00,106 --> 00:04:02,708
Miss Lewis has a crush on Mr. Ritter.

90
00:04:02,708 --> 00:04:03,576
Mr. Ritter?
Yeah.

91
00:04:03,576 --> 00:04:05,311
The grocery man?
Yeah.

92
00:04:05,311 --> 00:04:06,612
And she is so bashful

93
00:04:06,612 --> 00:04:09,649
that she doesn't want to ask him up
to supper,

94
00:04:09,649 --> 00:04:12,685
so I'm going to give him the
invitation for her.

95
00:04:12,685 --> 00:04:13,986
Uh-huh. Give it to me, nosy.

96
00:04:13,986 --> 00:04:16,589
Nosy? What are you talking about?

97
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:18,324
You know what I'm talking about.

98
00:04:18,324 --> 00:04:19,625
How many times have I told you

99
00:04:19,625 --> 00:04:21,794
not to get involved in other people's
lives?

100
00:04:21,794 --> 00:04:23,095
But I'm just trying to help a sweet
old lady.

101
00:04:23,095 --> 00:04:26,565
They might even get married, and then
they'll thank me.

102
00:04:26,565 --> 00:04:29,168
Yeah, she'll thank you; he'll sue
you.

103
00:04:29,168 --> 00:04:33,506
Well, is that the way you feel about
marriage?

104
00:04:33,506 --> 00:04:34,807
Oh, honey, of course not.

105
00:04:34,807 --> 00:04:36,976
I think marriage is wonderful.

106
00:04:36,976 --> 00:04:40,012
Why, I think marriage is the greatest
thing there is

107
00:04:40,446 --> 00:04:41,314
in the whole world.

108
00:04:41,314 --> 00:04:43,049
It's the only way to live.

109
00:04:43,049 --> 00:04:46,952
But if the guy has been clever enough
to escape it this long

110
00:04:46,952 --> 00:04:48,254
why louse him up now?

111
00:04:52,591 --> 00:04:54,327
What?

112
00:04:54,327 --> 00:04:55,628
Honey, I didn't mean...

113
00:04:55,628 --> 00:04:57,797
I suppose you weren't clever enough.

114
00:04:57,797 --> 00:05:01,701
Well... Well, honey, now...
I mean, uh...

115
00:05:01,701 --> 00:05:05,171
Well, I could have been clever
enough,

116
00:05:05,171 --> 00:05:09,508
but you were so cute, I decided to
play dumb.

117
00:05:09,508 --> 00:05:12,111
Well, all right, then, it's all
settled.

118
00:05:12,111 --> 00:05:14,714
I'll give this invitation to Mr.
Ritter.

119
00:05:14,714 --> 00:05:16,882
It's all settled; you'll do nothing
of the kind.

120
00:05:16,882 --> 00:05:18,617
What do you mean?

121
00:05:18,617 --> 00:05:20,353
Are you going to give that invitation
back

122
00:05:20,353 --> 00:05:21,220
to Mrs. Lewis or not?

123
00:05:21,654 --> 00:05:22,521
No!

124
00:05:22,521 --> 00:05:24,256
Lucy, if you're going to act like a
child,

125
00:05:24,256 --> 00:05:25,991
I'm going to have to treat you like
one.

126
00:05:25,991 --> 00:05:27,293
Meaning what?

127
00:05:27,293 --> 00:05:29,895
Meaning I'll put you over my knees...

128
00:05:29,895 --> 00:05:31,630
You wouldn't dare!

129
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:32,932
Oh, I wouldn't?

130
00:05:32,932 --> 00:05:34,233
No, you wouldn't!

131
00:05:34,233 --> 00:05:35,968
Ricky, Ricky!
Come here.

132
00:05:35,968 --> 00:05:38,571
Ricky, Ricky, Ricky!

133
00:05:38,571 --> 00:05:40,306
Are you going to do what I say?

134
00:05:40,306 --> 00:05:41,607
Oh, yes!

135
00:05:41,607 --> 00:05:42,475
All right.

136
00:05:42,475 --> 00:05:43,342
Oh, Ricky!

137
00:05:44,643 --> 00:05:46,379
(humming)

138
00:05:46,379 --> 00:05:47,680
(knocking at door)

139
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,415
Oh, come in.

140
00:05:50,716 --> 00:05:52,885
Oh, Mrs. Ricardo!

141
00:05:52,885 --> 00:05:54,186
Hello, Miss Lewis.

142
00:05:54,186 --> 00:05:55,921
I was just ironing the dress I'm
going to wear tonight.

143
00:05:56,355 --> 00:05:58,524
Yeah, well, that's what I came down
to talk to you about.

144
00:05:58,524 --> 00:06:01,560
This isn't really the one that I
wanted to wear at all.

145
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,295
I wanted to wear my good one,

146
00:06:03,295 --> 00:06:07,199
but it's in my hope chest and the
lock is rusted shut.

147
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:10,669
Oh. Well, it really won't make any
difference because I'm...

148
00:06:11,103 --> 00:06:12,405
Oh, of course it doesn't.

149
00:06:12,405 --> 00:06:14,140
Sit down, dear.

150
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:16,742
No, I don't think I care to sit down.

151
00:06:18,043 --> 00:06:20,212
Well, let me show you, here.

152
00:06:20,212 --> 00:06:24,984
Now, look, I thought that we'd eat by
candlelight,

153
00:06:24,984 --> 00:06:27,586
because they say it makes you look
younger.

154
00:06:27,586 --> 00:06:29,755
Oh, yes, that's right.

155
00:06:29,755 --> 00:06:33,225
Maybe I'll look like a girl of 50
again, huh?

156
00:06:33,225 --> 00:06:34,960
Oh, easily.

157
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:37,563
Oh, you're sweet, you're awfully
sweet.

158
00:06:40,599 --> 00:06:41,467
Look.

159
00:06:45,371 --> 00:06:48,841
Elderberry wine-- I made it myself.

160
00:06:48,841 --> 00:06:53,179
It's been fermenting since I was 21
years old.

161
00:06:53,179 --> 00:06:55,781
Twenty-one?

162
00:06:55,781 --> 00:06:58,818
Must have quite a tang by now.

163
00:06:58,818 --> 00:07:01,420
I thought Mr. Ritter and I could have

164
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:03,589
a couple of belts before dinner.

165
00:07:04,457 --> 00:07:06,625
Well, I don't think you're going to
get

166
00:07:06,625 --> 00:07:08,360
much chance to serve it, Miss Lewis.

167
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:10,529
You see, I had a long talk with my
husband...

168
00:07:10,529 --> 00:07:11,831
(gasps)

169
00:07:11,831 --> 00:07:13,566
Oh, husband!

170
00:07:13,999 --> 00:07:17,036
That's the most beautiful word in the
English language.

171
00:07:17,036 --> 00:07:18,337
(knocking at door)

172
00:07:18,337 --> 00:07:19,205
MAN: Miss Lewis!

173
00:07:19,205 --> 00:07:21,807
Don't forget... the invitation!

174
00:07:21,807 --> 00:07:25,277
I wanted to talk to you about that...

175
00:07:25,277 --> 00:07:27,012
Pretty late today, and I'm awful
sorry,

176
00:07:27,012 --> 00:07:28,747
but I want to tell you something.

177
00:07:28,747 --> 00:07:30,483
The traffic has been something awful.

178
00:07:30,483 --> 00:07:33,519
Oh, Mrs. Ricardo, howdy, howdy!

179
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:36,121
Awful cold out-- it's awful cold,
really.

180
00:07:36,121 --> 00:07:37,423
How are you?

181
00:07:37,423 --> 00:07:38,290
Fine.

182
00:07:38,290 --> 00:07:39,592
How are you?

183
00:07:39,592 --> 00:07:43,496
Me, I can't kick-- rheumatism.

184
00:07:43,496 --> 00:07:45,231
Get it?

185
00:07:45,231 --> 00:07:47,399
I don't know how I think of them.

186
00:07:47,399 --> 00:07:49,568
Just like that, you know, comical.

187
00:07:50,002 --> 00:07:51,303
Where is, uh, where is Miss Lewis?

188
00:07:51,303 --> 00:07:53,906
Well, she ought to be back in a
minute.

189
00:07:53,906 --> 00:07:54,773
Well, she can, uh...

190
00:07:54,773 --> 00:07:56,942
She can pay me for these when I come
the next time.

191
00:07:56,942 --> 00:07:59,111
Okay.

192
00:07:59,111 --> 00:08:00,846
Mr. Ritter?

193
00:08:00,846 --> 00:08:01,714
Huh?

194
00:08:01,714 --> 00:08:03,015
Come here.

195
00:08:06,051 --> 00:08:09,088
I have a secret to tell you.

196
00:08:10,823 --> 00:08:12,124
Uh...

197
00:08:13,425 --> 00:08:16,896
Someone around here is very fond of
you.

198
00:08:16,896 --> 00:08:18,197
No!

199
00:08:18,197 --> 00:08:20,799
Yes, a certain someone thinks

200
00:08:20,799 --> 00:08:23,402
that you're the bee's knees.

201
00:08:23,402 --> 00:08:26,005
Well, hot diggity!

202
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:28,607
You want to know something, Mrs.
Ricardo?

203
00:08:28,607 --> 00:08:29,475
What?

204
00:08:29,909 --> 00:08:32,077
I like you, too.

205
00:08:32,077 --> 00:08:33,379
What?

206
00:08:33,379 --> 00:08:35,548
You're just my type, Red.

207
00:08:35,548 --> 00:08:38,150
Oh, no, no, you don't understand.

208
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:39,451
Here, read this.
This will explain.

209
00:08:39,885 --> 00:08:43,789
"Can you make it for dinner tonight,
just the two of us?"

210
00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:44,657
Uh-oh.

211
00:08:44,657 --> 00:08:45,958
"Will be waiting for you in my
apartment."

212
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:46,825
Can I make it?

213
00:08:47,259 --> 00:08:49,428
Say, speed's my middle name, Lucy.

214
00:08:49,428 --> 00:08:50,729
Oh, now, now, stay away!

215
00:08:50,729 --> 00:08:52,464
I didn't write that note.
Miss Lewis did.

216
00:08:52,464 --> 00:08:54,199
Miss Lewis? Aw, who are you joshing?

217
00:08:54,199 --> 00:08:56,368
No, really, look at the signature.

218
00:08:56,368 --> 00:08:58,537
It says...
"Your secret lover."

219
00:08:58,537 --> 00:08:59,838
Secret lover?

220
00:08:59,838 --> 00:09:02,875
You don't have to keep anything
secret from me, lover.

221
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:04,610
No! Miss Lewis!
Miss Lewis!

222
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:07,212
Now, listen, you're not fooling
anybody.

223
00:09:07,212 --> 00:09:08,948
She's not here, you said so yourself.

224
00:09:08,948 --> 00:09:10,249
Don't try to fight this, Lucy.

225
00:09:10,249 --> 00:09:11,550
It's bigger than both of us.

226
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:12,851
It is not!

227
00:09:12,851 --> 00:09:15,888
Miss Lewis, Miss Lewis, where are
you?

228
00:09:15,888 --> 00:09:16,755
Miss Lewis!

229
00:09:16,755 --> 00:09:18,924
See, alone. I tell you it's fate,
really.

230
00:09:18,924 --> 00:09:20,225
But she was here, honest.

231
00:09:20,225 --> 00:09:21,527
Sure, she was, sure.

232
00:09:21,527 --> 00:09:24,129
You know you're even cuter when you
get shy like this.

233
00:09:24,129 --> 00:09:24,997
Mr. Ritter!

234
00:09:24,997 --> 00:09:27,166
Don't worry about anything--

235
00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:28,901
your apartment, dinner, tonight,
sure.

236
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:31,503
I'm afraid I can't make it till about
half past 7:00.

237
00:09:31,503 --> 00:09:32,805
Mr. Ritter!

238
00:09:32,805 --> 00:09:37,142
Oh, honey, I got to keep the store
open till 7:00, honest.

239
00:09:37,142 --> 00:09:38,010
Mr. Ritter!

240
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:43,649
(doorbell buzzing)

241
00:09:45,818 --> 00:09:47,987
Oh, Miss Lewis, where have you been?

242
00:09:47,987 --> 00:09:50,155
I've been calling you for hours.

243
00:09:50,155 --> 00:09:52,758
Oh, Mrs. Ricardo, I just lost control
of myself.

244
00:09:52,758 --> 00:09:55,361
When I found out that Mr. Ritter
thought

245
00:09:55,361 --> 00:09:57,096
you were inviting him to dinner,

246
00:09:57,096 --> 00:09:59,698
I got hysterical and started running.

247
00:09:59,698 --> 00:10:01,867
Ran eight laps around the park.

248
00:10:01,867 --> 00:10:05,337
Passed lots of horses.

249
00:10:06,205 --> 00:10:07,940
Oh...

250
00:10:09,675 --> 00:10:11,410
I'm pooped.

251
00:10:12,711 --> 00:10:15,748
Well, you certainly got me in a fine
mess.

252
00:10:15,748 --> 00:10:18,350
Your secret lover is coming here for
dinner at 7:30

253
00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:20,953
and my husband is due home at the
same time.

254
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:23,122
Oh... well, why don't you call him

255
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:25,290
and tell him your husband's going to
be here?

256
00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:27,026
I did-- he was delighted.

257
00:10:27,026 --> 00:10:29,194
He wants to tell Ricky that we love
each other

258
00:10:29,194 --> 00:10:31,363
and that he should start getting a
divorce right away.

259
00:10:31,363 --> 00:10:35,701
Oh... oh, I wish there was some way I
could help.

260
00:10:35,701 --> 00:10:37,002
There is.

261
00:10:37,002 --> 00:10:38,303
What?

262
00:10:38,303 --> 00:10:39,605
You stay on those stairs tonight

263
00:10:39,605 --> 00:10:41,774
and don't let Mr. Ritter get into
this apartment.

264
00:10:41,774 --> 00:10:43,509
You get him into your apartment.

265
00:10:43,509 --> 00:10:44,376
How?

266
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:46,545
I don't know how you're going to do
it, but you do it.

267
00:10:46,545 --> 00:10:48,714
Mrs. Ricardo?

268
00:10:48,714 --> 00:10:50,015
What?

269
00:10:50,015 --> 00:10:53,919
Would you teach me how to attract the
opposite...

270
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:55,654
sex?

271
00:10:56,955 --> 00:10:58,257
Well, all right.

272
00:10:58,257 --> 00:11:00,859
Stand up, let's have a look at you.

273
00:11:01,727 --> 00:11:02,594
(groans)

274
00:11:06,498 --> 00:11:07,800
Well...

275
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,968
um, let's see you walk back and forth

276
00:11:09,968 --> 00:11:11,270
and swing your hips.

277
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:13,005
Swing my hips?

278
00:11:13,005 --> 00:11:14,306
Yes.

279
00:11:22,114 --> 00:11:23,415
Oh, no, no, no, no.

280
00:11:23,415 --> 00:11:24,717
All that will get you

281
00:11:24,717 --> 00:11:28,187
is a Boy Scout to help you across the
street.

282
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:29,922
Look, now, watch me.

283
00:11:29,922 --> 00:11:31,657
You just shift them gently.

284
00:11:31,657 --> 00:11:33,826
Shift, shift, shift

285
00:11:33,826 --> 00:11:35,561
shift, shift...

286
00:11:35,561 --> 00:11:36,428
Shift them?

287
00:11:36,428 --> 00:11:38,597
That's easy for you.

288
00:11:38,597 --> 00:11:41,200
I've got a rusty transmission.

289
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,935
(sighs)

290
00:11:42,935 --> 00:11:44,236
I'm sorry.

291
00:11:44,236 --> 00:11:46,839
Maybe we could try a "come hither"
look.

292
00:11:52,911 --> 00:11:53,779
Yeah.

293
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:57,249
Miss Lewis, what's the matter?

294
00:11:57,249 --> 00:11:58,117
Are you all right?

295
00:11:58,550 --> 00:11:59,418
What's the matter?

296
00:11:59,418 --> 00:12:01,153
There's nothing the matter.

297
00:12:01,153 --> 00:12:03,322
That's my "come hither" look.

298
00:12:03,322 --> 00:12:04,189
Oh.

299
00:12:04,189 --> 00:12:06,792
Oh, no, dear, try something like
this.

300
00:12:09,828 --> 00:12:11,997
Oh, dear.

301
00:12:12,431 --> 00:12:13,298
(phone rings)

302
00:12:13,298 --> 00:12:14,600
Oh, excuse me.

303
00:12:15,033 --> 00:12:15,901
Hello.

304
00:12:15,901 --> 00:12:16,769
Yes, dear?

305
00:12:16,769 --> 00:12:18,070
It's Ricky.

306
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:21,106
Honey, I won't be home tonight for
dinner.

307
00:12:21,106 --> 00:12:22,407
LUCY: Oh?

308
00:12:22,407 --> 00:12:24,143
No, I have to stay in town.

309
00:12:24,576 --> 00:12:27,613
Jerry and I are going to talk some
business.

310
00:12:27,613 --> 00:12:29,782
Oh, well, all right, dear.

311
00:12:29,782 --> 00:12:31,950
Don't be too lonesome.

312
00:12:31,950 --> 00:12:33,685
Oh, no, no, I won't.

313
00:12:33,685 --> 00:12:35,420
Good-bye.

314
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:37,589
Ricky isn't coming home to dinner.

315
00:12:37,589 --> 00:12:39,324
You know, I just think

316
00:12:39,324 --> 00:12:42,361
I might keep that date with Mr.
Ritter tonight.

317
00:12:42,361 --> 00:12:44,530
That's not fair.

318
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:45,831
He's mine.

319
00:12:45,831 --> 00:12:47,566
Oh, you don't understand, dear.

320
00:12:47,566 --> 00:12:49,301
I'm going to get him up here

321
00:12:49,301 --> 00:12:51,470
and disappoint him so completely

322
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:54,506
that he wouldn't have me on a silver
platter.

323
00:12:54,506 --> 00:12:56,675
Then the road will be nice and clear
for you.

324
00:12:56,675 --> 00:12:58,410
Oh, oh, fine, fine.

325
00:12:58,410 --> 00:13:01,013
Let's see now, how can I disappoint
Mr. Ritter?

326
00:13:01,013 --> 00:13:02,748
What do you know about him?

327
00:13:02,748 --> 00:13:07,519
Well, we had a long conversation once
over the pickle barrel.

328
00:13:07,953 --> 00:13:10,122
That sort of raised my hopes.

329
00:13:10,122 --> 00:13:12,291
Um...

330
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:14,459
he can't stand children.

331
00:13:14,459 --> 00:13:17,062
And he likes a tidy appearance,

332
00:13:17,062 --> 00:13:20,532
and he demands immaculate
housekeeping.

333
00:13:20,532 --> 00:13:22,267
He likes good cooking...

334
00:13:22,267 --> 00:13:24,436
Hold it, hold it.

335
00:13:24,436 --> 00:13:27,472
I think I can change Mr. Ritter's
heartthrob

336
00:13:27,472 --> 00:13:29,208
to heartburn in one sitting.

337
00:13:40,052 --> 00:13:44,389
(doorbell buzzing)

338
00:13:56,101 --> 00:13:58,704
Well, Mr. Ritter!

339
00:13:58,704 --> 00:14:00,873
How are you tonight?

340
00:14:00,873 --> 00:14:03,041
You ask that at a time like this?

341
00:14:05,210 --> 00:14:07,379
Oh, for me?

342
00:14:07,379 --> 00:14:09,114
Uh-huh, the whole bag.

343
00:14:09,114 --> 00:14:09,982
Oh, thank you.

344
00:14:09,982 --> 00:14:11,717
Oh, gumdrops!

345
00:14:11,717 --> 00:14:13,018
Thank you.

346
00:14:13,452 --> 00:14:14,753
Can I take your coat off?

347
00:14:14,753 --> 00:14:16,488
Please.

348
00:14:16,488 --> 00:14:18,657
There we are.

349
00:14:18,657 --> 00:14:20,392
Hat?

350
00:14:20,392 --> 00:14:21,260
Oh.

351
00:14:22,561 --> 00:14:23,428
Just a minute.

352
00:14:23,428 --> 00:14:24,730
What's that?

353
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:25,597
Oh!

354
00:14:45,117 --> 00:14:47,719
Well, sit down; dinner's almost
ready.

355
00:14:47,719 --> 00:14:49,021
Yeah, that's right.

356
00:14:49,021 --> 00:14:52,057
I'm very anxious for you to sample my
cooking.

357
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:53,792
So am I.

358
00:14:53,792 --> 00:14:56,828
Oh! Oh! Pardon me.

359
00:14:56,828 --> 00:14:59,865
Oh, I'm so sorry.

360
00:14:59,865 --> 00:15:01,600
There we are.

361
00:15:06,805 --> 00:15:09,841
Well, I hope you like tomato juice.

362
00:15:09,841 --> 00:15:11,143
Oh, I do, I like it very much.

363
00:15:11,143 --> 00:15:12,444
Yeah, this, huh?
Yeah.

364
00:15:12,444 --> 00:15:15,480
This is our special every Thursday
down at my store.

365
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:16,348
Oh, is that so?

366
00:15:16,782 --> 00:15:17,649
Yeah, yes.

367
00:15:17,649 --> 00:15:19,818
Well, the same brand it is, yes,
sure.

368
00:15:19,818 --> 00:15:20,686
Is that so?

369
00:15:20,686 --> 00:15:22,854
Well, here's...
uh, what is it now?

370
00:15:22,854 --> 00:15:24,156
Here's mud in your eye.
Oh!

371
00:15:24,156 --> 00:15:25,891
Of course, it ain't mud;

372
00:15:25,891 --> 00:15:27,626
it's really tomato juice.

373
00:15:27,626 --> 00:15:30,662
Yeah. You know, I put the tiniest
dash of Tabasco in this.

374
00:15:30,662 --> 00:15:31,530
Inside?

375
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:32,831
Yeah.

376
00:15:32,831 --> 00:15:35,434
Yes, it helps, you know, everything,
you know...

377
00:15:39,338 --> 00:15:40,639
Just right, huh?

378
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:41,940
Oh, fine...

379
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:43,675
(gasps)

380
00:15:43,675 --> 00:15:45,410
(coughing)

381
00:15:45,410 --> 00:15:47,579
Want some more?

382
00:15:47,579 --> 00:15:50,182
No, something to chew on, like a
piece of bread.

383
00:15:50,182 --> 00:15:51,917
Oh, I have some nice, fluffy
biscuits.

384
00:15:51,917 --> 00:15:53,218
Oh, I'm crazy about...

385
00:15:53,218 --> 00:15:54,953
Hurry, will you, hurry!

386
00:15:59,725 --> 00:16:01,026
Oh!

387
00:16:09,701 --> 00:16:12,304
Well, a little dirt never hurt
anybody.

388
00:16:13,605 --> 00:16:16,641
No, really, I don't think I care for
biscuits.

389
00:16:16,641 --> 00:16:17,509
Oh, no?

390
00:16:17,509 --> 00:16:18,810
No.

391
00:16:18,810 --> 00:16:20,112
Well, I hope you like soup.

392
00:16:20,112 --> 00:16:21,413
That's what's coming up next.

393
00:16:21,413 --> 00:16:22,714
Soup, yes.
Soothing soup.

394
00:16:22,714 --> 00:16:23,582
Yeah, hot.

395
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:28,353
There you are.

396
00:16:28,353 --> 00:16:29,654
Mmm...

397
00:16:29,654 --> 00:16:31,390
(cans clank)

398
00:16:34,426 --> 00:16:35,727
Mine's too hot.

399
00:16:35,727 --> 00:16:37,896
It's always too hot for me.

400
00:16:37,896 --> 00:16:39,631
(slurping)

401
00:16:39,631 --> 00:16:42,234
(continues slurping)

402
00:17:19,271 --> 00:17:20,405
Want some more?

403
00:17:20,405 --> 00:17:23,008
I'm not really much of a soup eater.

404
00:17:23,008 --> 00:17:23,875
You're not?

405
00:17:23,875 --> 00:17:25,177
Why not?

406
00:17:25,177 --> 00:17:26,478
A throat condition.

407
00:17:26,478 --> 00:17:27,345
Oh.

408
00:17:27,779 --> 00:17:30,382
You know, you have a very finicky
appetite.

409
00:17:30,382 --> 00:17:33,418
No, I'm pretty rugged as a rule,
pretty rugged.

410
00:17:33,418 --> 00:17:36,021
You like roast turkey with sage
dressing?

411
00:17:36,021 --> 00:17:38,623
I love it, yes-- dark meat, you know.

412
00:17:38,623 --> 00:17:39,925
Nice and juicy, huh?

413
00:17:39,925 --> 00:17:42,094
Well, we're not having that tonight.

414
00:17:44,696 --> 00:17:46,865
How about pot roast and...

415
00:17:46,865 --> 00:17:47,732
Oh, with the pancake, huh?

416
00:17:47,732 --> 00:17:49,901
Potato pancakes, apple sauce.

417
00:17:49,901 --> 00:17:51,203
Oh, my. I had a banquet once...

418
00:17:51,636 --> 00:17:53,805
We're not having that tonight either.

419
00:17:53,805 --> 00:17:55,107
We're having steak.

420
00:17:55,107 --> 00:17:55,974
Steak?
Yeah.

421
00:17:55,974 --> 00:17:57,275
Oh, steak.
Yeah.

422
00:17:57,275 --> 00:17:59,010
Oh, haven't had it for months.

423
00:17:59,444 --> 00:18:02,481
We have them down at my store, but I
can't afford to buy them.

424
00:18:10,722 --> 00:18:13,758
Well, here we are, nice, sizzling
steak.

425
00:18:36,314 --> 00:18:37,616
Hang on to this, will you?

426
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:38,917
Oh, I don't think...

427
00:18:38,917 --> 00:18:41,086
Oh, go ahead, I won't hurt you.

428
00:18:41,086 --> 00:18:41,953
Come on, hang on.

429
00:18:41,953 --> 00:18:43,255
Attaboy.

430
00:18:44,556 --> 00:18:45,857
There we are.

431
00:18:45,857 --> 00:18:47,159
Oop!

432
00:18:47,159 --> 00:18:49,761
Sorry, I lose more friends that way.

433
00:18:51,496 --> 00:18:53,231
Well, here we are.

434
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:05,810
(sneezes)

435
00:19:05,810 --> 00:19:07,112
Gesundheit.

436
00:19:10,148 --> 00:19:11,449
Lucy?

437
00:19:11,449 --> 00:19:12,751
Yeah?
You know something?

438
00:19:12,751 --> 00:19:14,052
What?

439
00:19:14,052 --> 00:19:15,353
I'm not hungry.

440
00:19:15,353 --> 00:19:16,221
You're not?

441
00:19:16,221 --> 00:19:17,522
I'm not hungry.

442
00:19:17,522 --> 00:19:19,691
You don't like my cooking.
No...

443
00:19:19,691 --> 00:19:21,860
You're disappointed in me.

444
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:24,896
You're going away and you're never
coming back.

445
00:19:24,896 --> 00:19:26,631
I am not!

446
00:19:26,631 --> 00:19:28,800
Lucy, I'll never leave you, never.

447
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:29,668
You won't?

448
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:31,836
What's food compared to the
fundamental principles?

449
00:19:31,836 --> 00:19:33,572
We love each other; that's all that
counts.

450
00:19:33,572 --> 00:19:36,608
Now, I'm going to do all the cooking
until you learn how.

451
00:19:37,042 --> 00:19:38,343
The important thing is...

452
00:19:38,343 --> 00:19:40,946
Quiet, you're waking the children.

453
00:19:40,946 --> 00:19:42,681
Don't stop me. The important thing
is...

454
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:43,548
The what?

455
00:19:43,548 --> 00:19:44,416
The children.

456
00:19:44,849 --> 00:19:46,151
You haven't any children.

457
00:19:46,151 --> 00:19:47,452
Oh, yes, I have.

458
00:19:47,452 --> 00:19:49,187
You never told me.
I've never seen one...

459
00:19:49,187 --> 00:19:50,488
I keep them hidden.

460
00:19:50,488 --> 00:19:52,657
They don't like kids in this
apartment house.

461
00:19:53,091 --> 00:19:55,260
You mean to tell me that you're the
mother

462
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:56,561
of these lollipop-eating,

463
00:19:56,561 --> 00:19:58,296
sticky-fingered, candy-stealing...

464
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:00,031
That's right, and if you're not going
to eat your dinner,

465
00:20:00,031 --> 00:20:01,333
I'm going to have to give it to the
kids.

466
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:02,634
I can't eat that.

467
00:20:02,634 --> 00:20:05,237
All right, children, come and get it!

468
00:20:05,237 --> 00:20:07,839
Come and get it!

469
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:21,286
Oh, oh, oh, Mr. Ricardo?

470
00:20:21,286 --> 00:20:22,587
Yes, Miss Lewis?

471
00:20:22,587 --> 00:20:26,057
Mr. Ricardo, could I see you for a
minute?

472
00:20:26,057 --> 00:20:28,660
Why, sure, Miss Lewis.

473
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:30,829
Yes, yes, it's, um...

474
00:20:30,829 --> 00:20:33,865
Oh, it's a nice evening, isn't it?

475
00:20:33,865 --> 00:20:37,769
Yes, lovely, if you like it below
zero.

476
00:20:37,769 --> 00:20:39,070
Oh, below zero.

477
00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:41,239
Well, um...

478
00:20:41,239 --> 00:20:42,974
uh... is...

479
00:20:42,974 --> 00:20:46,444
Miss Lewis, if there's nothing else
on your mind,

480
00:20:46,444 --> 00:20:48,179
I'm anxious to get upstairs.

481
00:20:48,613 --> 00:20:49,481
Oh...

482
00:21:02,927 --> 00:21:05,964
Miss Lewis, are you having an attack?

483
00:21:09,434 --> 00:21:11,603
Razz-a-matazz.

484
00:21:14,205 --> 00:21:15,940
Razz-a... razz-a-matazz...

485
00:21:17,676 --> 00:21:18,977
I'll see you later.

486
00:21:18,977 --> 00:21:20,278
No, no, no!

487
00:21:20,278 --> 00:21:23,315
You can't go up there until Mr.
Ritter leaves.

488
00:21:23,315 --> 00:21:25,050
What?!

489
00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:26,785
Did Lucy give him that invitation?

490
00:21:28,086 --> 00:21:29,387
Oh...

491
00:21:29,387 --> 00:21:32,424
Yes, poor dear, and he thought it was
from her,

492
00:21:32,424 --> 00:21:34,592
and now he wants to marry her.

493
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:36,761
He wants to...

494
00:21:43,268 --> 00:21:44,569
She's... she's...

495
00:21:44,569 --> 00:21:47,605
she's upstairs now trying to
discourage him.

496
00:21:47,605 --> 00:21:48,473
She is?

497
00:21:48,473 --> 00:21:51,076
Oh, this is great, this is wonderful.

498
00:21:51,076 --> 00:21:53,244
I'll see you later, good-bye.

499
00:21:53,244 --> 00:21:54,546
Oh, Mr. Ricardo...

500
00:21:54,546 --> 00:21:56,715
Yes, yes, dear?

501
00:21:56,715 --> 00:21:59,751
You're the first man I ever flirted
with,

502
00:21:59,751 --> 00:22:02,354
and do you want to know something?

503
00:22:02,354 --> 00:22:03,221
What?

504
00:22:03,221 --> 00:22:04,522
I like it.

505
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:07,992
Well, I think you're very cute.

506
00:22:07,992 --> 00:22:09,294
I'll see you later.

507
00:22:09,294 --> 00:22:11,896
(Ricky laughing)

508
00:22:12,764 --> 00:22:14,499
Twenty-two...

509
00:22:14,499 --> 00:22:16,234
twenty-three...

510
00:22:16,234 --> 00:22:17,535
twenty-four...

511
00:22:24,909 --> 00:22:26,211
Twenty-four and a half.

512
00:22:26,211 --> 00:22:29,681
You know, Lucy, that's an awful lot
of children.

513
00:22:29,681 --> 00:22:31,416
Six of them are missing.

514
Missing
515
00:22:32,283 --> 00:22:33,151
Yeah. Well, now you know.

516
00:22:33,151 --> 00:22:34,886
Go ahead and leave me.

517
00:22:34,886 --> 00:22:36,187
I wouldn't blame you.

518
00:22:36,187 --> 00:22:37,922
Lucy, you know that I hate kids.

519
00:22:38,356 --> 00:22:39,224
Yeah?

520
00:22:39,224 --> 00:22:40,959
I can't stand bad housekeeping...
Yeah.

521
00:22:41,393 --> 00:22:42,260
and sloppy food.
Yeah.

522
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:44,429
But when a guy has got a chickadee
like you

523
00:22:44,863 --> 00:22:46,164
nothing else really matters.

524
00:22:46,164 --> 00:22:47,465
Come to me, baby!

525
00:22:47,465 --> 00:22:49,200
No, now, Mr. Ritter!

526
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,502
Hi, Lucy.

527
00:22:54,406 --> 00:22:56,141
Hello, Mr. Ritter.

528
00:23:01,346 --> 00:23:02,647
What's new?

529
00:23:04,382 --> 00:23:06,551
What's new?!

530
00:23:06,551 --> 00:23:09,587
Mr. Ricardo, there's something you
ought to know.

531
00:23:09,587 --> 00:23:11,756
Your wife and I love each other.

532
00:23:11,756 --> 00:23:12,624
No!

533
00:23:12,624 --> 00:23:14,793
No, Ricky, let me explain.

534
00:23:14,793 --> 00:23:16,528
Well, honey, there's nothing to
explain.

535
00:23:16,528 --> 00:23:19,564
I've been expecting this for some
time.

536
00:23:19,564 --> 00:23:21,299
You been "specting" what?

537
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:25,203
Well, I can't possibly hope to keep

538
00:23:25,203 --> 00:23:27,372
such a glorious hunk of stuff like
you

539
00:23:27,372 --> 00:23:29,107
all to myself forever.

540
00:23:29,107 --> 00:23:29,974
Of course not.

541
00:23:29,974 --> 00:23:31,276
I pass her on to you.

542
00:23:31,276 --> 00:23:33,878
And you pass her into waiting hands.

543
00:23:33,878 --> 00:23:34,746
Wait a minute.

544
00:23:34,746 --> 00:23:37,348
Can the football say something?

545
00:23:37,348 --> 00:23:40,819
Mr. Ritter, please be good to her.

546
00:23:40,819 --> 00:23:42,987
She'll make a wonderful wife.

547
00:23:42,987 --> 00:23:44,722
Ricardo, you're a good scout.

548
00:23:44,722 --> 00:23:48,193
I'm going to send you a whole case of
lima beans.

549
00:23:48,193 --> 00:23:50,361
And don't you worry about Lucy,

550
00:23:50,361 --> 00:23:53,398
and don't you worry about those
children.

551
00:23:53,398 --> 00:23:55,133
What children?

552
00:23:55,133 --> 00:23:59,904
Say, you really hid those kids,
didn't you?

553
00:24:01,639 --> 00:24:03,374
Now, Ricky, listen...

554
00:24:03,374 --> 00:24:05,977
Honey, please, please don't say
another word.

555
00:24:05,977 --> 00:24:09,013
Just stand there like you are.

556
00:24:09,013 --> 00:24:12,484
I want to remember you like this
forever.

557
00:24:13,351 --> 00:24:15,954
Good-bye-- I'll pack my things.

558
00:24:15,954 --> 00:24:17,255
Ricky!

559
00:24:17,255 --> 00:24:18,556
Don't worry about him, don't-- you
got me.

560
00:24:18,990 --> 00:24:20,291
Oh, wait a minute, leave me alone!

561
00:24:20,291 --> 00:24:22,894
At last, at last you're altogether
mine.

562
00:24:22,894 --> 00:24:24,195
Mr. Ritter!

563
00:24:29,834 --> 00:24:30,702
What's the matter?

564
00:24:30,702 --> 00:24:32,437
What's the matter with you?

565
00:24:32,437 --> 00:24:33,738
Lover boy!

566
00:24:33,738 --> 00:24:34,606
(screams)

567
00:25:17,115 --> 00:25:21,019
Captioned by Media Access Group at
WGBH access.wgbh.org

568
00:25:33,598 --> 00:25:35,333
We'd like to give our special thanks

569
00:25:35,333 --> 00:25:38,803
to Mr. Edward Everett Horton for
appearing with us tonight.

570
00:25:38,803 --> 00:25:41,839
The part of Miss Lewis was played by
Bea Benaderet.

571
00:26:13,938 --> 00:26:16,541
I Love Lucy is a Desilu production.

(theme music ending)

00:00:28,094 --> 00:00:29,996
Ricky!

5
00:00:29,996 --> 00:00:31,498
Ricky!

6
00:00:34,501 --> 00:00:36,002
Ricky!

7
00:00:36,002 --> 00:00:38,004
LUCY: He isn't home yet.

8
00:00:38,004 --> 00:00:40,507
(whines:)
Oh!

9
00:00:40,507 --> 00:00:41,424
And what is this, Ethel?

10
00:00:41,424 --> 00:00:42,425
It's the third time today

11
00:00:42,425 --> 00:00:44,427
you've been up here asking for Ricky.

12
00:00:44,427 --> 00:00:46,429
Well, Fred and I want to talk to him
about his ad in Variety.

13
00:00:46,429 --> 00:00:47,914
Ethel...
Ad in Variety?
Uh-huh.

14
00:00:47,914 --> 00:00:49,916
See you later, Lucy.
We got to go.

15
00:00:49,916 --> 00:00:50,917
Ethel, what is it?

16
00:00:50,917 --> 00:00:52,419
Come on, Ethel.
Ethel, tell me.

17
00:00:52,419 --> 00:00:53,420
Come on!
Ethel!

18
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:54,421
Wait a minute!

19
00:00:54,421 --> 00:00:55,422
One of you let go

20
00:00:55,422 --> 00:00:57,924
or I'm going to have a split
personality.

21
00:00:57,924 --> 00:01:00,927
All right, Ethel, let's have it.

22
00:01:00,927 --> 00:01:03,430
Well?
Well, as long as you've opened your
big bazoo

23
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:05,432
you might as well tell her the whole
thing.

24
00:01:05,432 --> 00:01:06,933
All right.

25
00:01:06,933 --> 00:01:07,934
You see, it's this way.

26
00:01:07,934 --> 00:01:09,436
We saw Ricky's ad in Variety.

27
00:01:09,436 --> 00:01:10,937
Ricky's ad?
What's it for?

28
00:01:10,937 --> 00:01:13,440
He's looking for new acts for his
show down at the club.

29
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:15,442
I didn't see that.

30
00:01:15,442 --> 00:01:16,943
Where's our Variety?

31
00:01:16,943 --> 00:01:17,944
Here it is.

32
00:01:18,445 --> 00:01:20,447
It's inside the back page, I think.

33
00:01:20,447 --> 00:01:21,448
Oh. (gasps)

34
00:01:21,448 --> 00:01:22,449
How do you like that?

35
00:01:22,949 --> 00:01:23,950
He cut it out.

36
00:01:24,451 --> 00:01:25,452
He told me there was

37
00:01:25,452 --> 00:01:27,954
a recipe in here he wanted to save.

38
00:01:27,954 --> 00:01:28,955
He's a slick one, all right.

39
00:01:28,955 --> 00:01:31,458
He'd do anything to keep you from
going in show business.

40
00:01:31,458 --> 00:01:34,461
Yeah, well, what kind of acts does
Tricky Ricky need?

41
00:01:34,961 --> 00:01:35,962
Well, he needs a dance team.

42
00:01:35,962 --> 00:01:37,464
That's where Fred and I come in.

43
00:01:37,464 --> 00:01:39,466
Yeah, anywhere where I come in?

44
00:01:39,466 --> 00:01:41,468
Well, he needs a good dog act.

45
00:01:41,468 --> 00:01:43,470
Well, thanks a lot.

46
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:44,971
Fred Mertz!

47
00:01:44,971 --> 00:01:47,474
And the ad said he needed a beautiful
showgirl, too.

48
00:01:47,474 --> 00:01:48,475
That's me!
Sure.

49
00:01:48,475 --> 00:01:49,976
Hey, looks like there's a spot

50
00:01:49,976 --> 00:01:51,478
for all of us in his show.
Yeah.

51
00:01:51,478 --> 00:01:53,480
And this time, we're not going to let
him

52
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:54,481
talk us out of it...
No.

53
00:01:54,481 --> 00:01:55,482
Not for one minute.

54
00:01:55,482 --> 00:01:56,483
Hi, everybody.

55
00:01:56,483 --> 00:02:01,988
(all humming tunes)

56
00:02:16,002 --> 00:02:18,004
What's going on here?

57
00:02:18,004 --> 00:02:21,007
We're answering your recipe in
Variety.

58
00:02:21,007 --> 00:02:22,509
Oh, so that's it, huh?
Yeah.

59
00:02:22,509 --> 00:02:24,010
(Lucy humming)
Yeah, that's it.

60
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:25,011
Give us a chance

61
00:02:25,011 --> 00:02:27,013
to show you our routine, will you,
Rick?

62
00:02:27,013 --> 00:02:28,515
Come on, you might...
you might like it

63
00:02:28,515 --> 00:02:30,517
if you give us a chance to show it to
you.

64
00:02:30,517 --> 00:02:32,018
(all clamoring)

65
00:02:32,018 --> 00:02:33,520
LUCY: Ricky!

66
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,021
(clamoring continuing)

67
00:02:35,522 --> 00:02:37,023
Thanks for coming down, folks.

68
00:02:37,023 --> 00:02:39,025
And don't call us, we'll call you.

69
00:02:39,025 --> 00:02:40,527
(knocking/door buzzer buzzing)

70
00:02:40,527 --> 00:02:42,028
LUCY: Ricky, you open this door!

71
00:02:42,028 --> 00:02:45,031
I'm sorry, but the casting office is
closed for the day.

72
00:02:45,031 --> 00:02:48,535
Ricky Ricardo, you open this door!
(buzzing/pounding continuing)

73
00:02:48,535 --> 00:02:50,537
Who wants to come in--

74
00:02:50,537 --> 00:02:54,541
two dancers and a showgirl or the
Mertzes and my wife?

75
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:56,042
(buzzing/pounding stops)

76
00:02:56,042 --> 00:02:59,045
Well, you better make up your mind.

77
00:02:59,045 --> 00:03:00,046
Who is going to be?

78
00:03:00,046 --> 00:03:02,999
(all humming)

79
00:03:10,006 --> 00:03:13,509
Hold it. Hold it.

80
00:03:13,509 --> 00:03:15,011
Hold it!

81
00:03:15,011 --> 00:03:16,012
FRED: What?

82
00:03:16,012 --> 00:03:17,013
Now, wait a minute.

83
00:03:17,013 --> 00:03:19,515
Now, Ricky, before you say no, take a
good look at us.

84
00:03:19,515 --> 00:03:21,517
Look at the Mertzes; they're
wonderful dancers.

85
00:03:21,517 --> 00:03:23,519
The least you could do is give them
an audition.

86
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:26,522
Tah-dah!

87
00:03:26,522 --> 00:03:29,525
All right, all right, they can come
down and audition

88
00:03:29,525 --> 00:03:32,028
but you're not going to get any more
consideration

89
00:03:32,028 --> 00:03:33,029
than anyone else.

90
00:03:33,029 --> 00:03:34,530
Oh, fine, Ricky.
Good enough.

91
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:36,032
All right. Now that that's all
settled

92
00:03:36,032 --> 00:03:37,533
how about a little game of cards, eh?

93
00:03:37,533 --> 00:03:39,035
Well, Ricky, what about me?

94
00:03:39,035 --> 00:03:40,536
Oh, you can play, too.

95
00:03:40,536 --> 00:03:43,539
No, no, I mean you're giving Fred and
Ethel their chance.

96
00:03:43,539 --> 00:03:46,042
Haven't you got a place for me in the
show?

97
00:03:46,042 --> 00:03:48,044
Why, sure, honey.
I got just the place for you.

98
00:03:48,544 --> 00:03:50,046
Where?
Out front, in the audience.

99
00:03:50,046 --> 00:03:51,547
Oh, you.

100
00:03:51,547 --> 00:03:53,549
Ricky, I think you're being mean.

101
00:03:53,549 --> 00:03:56,052
If you keep Lucy from doing what she
wants to do

102
00:03:56,052 --> 00:03:58,054
she'll develop some sort of a
complex.

103
00:03:58,054 --> 00:04:00,056
Yeah.

104
00:04:02,058 --> 00:04:03,559
She might become depressed.

105
00:04:03,559 --> 00:04:06,562
Yeah.

106
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:10,566
She might even go off her trolley.

107
00:04:10,566 --> 00:04:14,504
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

108
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:17,507
Thank you, Dr. Mertz.

109
00:04:17,507 --> 00:04:20,510
Now, what is it going to be-- bridge
or canasta?

110
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:22,011
Oh, Ricky, you make me so mad.

111
00:04:22,011 --> 00:04:24,013
Now, we're going to have this out
right now.

112
00:04:24,013 --> 00:04:26,516
You're never going to let me be in
your show, are you?

113
00:04:26,516 --> 00:04:28,017
Never! Never! Never!

114
00:04:28,017 --> 00:04:30,019
Now, honey, don't be so upset.

115
00:04:30,019 --> 00:04:31,020
Who knows?

116
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:34,023
Maybe some day in the far, distant
future

117
00:04:34,023 --> 00:04:36,025
you may get your chance.

118
00:04:36,025 --> 00:04:37,026
Where?

119
00:04:37,026 --> 00:04:39,529
In that big nightclub up yonder?

120
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:41,030
I can see it now--

121
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:43,533
Ricky Ricardo and his Heavenly Revue

122
00:04:43,533 --> 00:04:46,035
starring Lucy and her magic harp.

123
00:04:58,915 --> 00:05:01,417
Good morning, Lucy.

124
00:05:01,417 --> 00:05:02,418
Hi.

125
00:05:06,422 --> 00:05:08,424
Pour yourself a cup of coffee.

126
00:05:08,424 --> 00:05:10,927
Thanks, I will.

127
00:05:10,927 --> 00:05:12,428
Why don't you sit down?

128
00:05:12,428 --> 00:05:14,430
Don't mind if I do.

129
00:05:16,432 --> 00:05:18,434
Help yourself to a cookie.

130
00:05:18,434 --> 00:05:21,938
No, thanks, I'm not hungry.

131
00:05:21,938 --> 00:05:23,439
What are you reading?

132
00:05:23,439 --> 00:05:25,942
Listen, do you remember last night
when you told Ricky

133
00:05:25,942 --> 00:05:27,944
that if I didn't get into show
business

134
00:05:27,944 --> 00:05:29,946
I might develop some sort of a
complex?

135
00:05:29,946 --> 00:05:30,947
Yeah.
Well, you were right.

136
00:05:30,947 --> 00:05:32,448
Yeah?
I got this book at the library

137
00:05:32,949 --> 00:05:34,951
and it says anybody who is constantly
frustrated

138
00:05:34,951 --> 00:05:36,452
may do all sorts of things.

139
00:05:36,452 --> 00:05:37,453
So?

140
00:05:37,453 --> 00:05:38,454
So, look.

141
00:05:38,454 --> 00:05:39,956
Abnormal Psychology.

142
00:05:39,956 --> 00:05:43,459
Yeah, I'm learning to act abnormal.

143
00:05:43,459 --> 00:05:45,461
For this, you need a book?

144
00:05:45,461 --> 00:05:46,963
I thought you were on my side.

145
00:05:46,963 --> 00:05:48,965
I am, but I was just making all that
stuff up

146
00:05:48,965 --> 00:05:49,966
as I went along last night.

147
00:05:49,966 --> 00:05:51,467
I don't really know anything about
it.

148
00:05:51,968 --> 00:05:53,469
Oh, yes, you do.
Listen to this.

149
00:05:53,469 --> 00:05:57,473
"A person who is kept

150
00:05:57,473 --> 00:05:58,975
"may manifest this frustration

151
00:05:58,975 --> 00:06:00,476
"in the following ways:

152
00:06:00,476 --> 00:06:02,979
"One, he may assume the
characteristics

153
00:06:02,979 --> 00:06:05,481
of the person he is kept from
becoming."

154
00:06:05,481 --> 00:06:08,985
Now, you know Ricky's kept me from
becoming a famous actress.

155
00:06:08,985 --> 00:06:09,986
Uh-huh.

156
00:06:09,986 --> 00:06:11,988
"Two, he may develop amnesia."

157
00:06:11,988 --> 00:06:13,489
Uh-huh.

158
00:06:13,489 --> 00:06:15,992
"Three, he may withdraw from reality

159
00:06:15,992 --> 00:06:17,994
and become childlike again."

160
00:06:18,494 --> 00:06:19,996
Gee, what a keen bunch of complexes.

161
00:06:19,996 --> 00:06:20,997
Which one of them

162
00:06:20,997 --> 00:06:22,498
are you going to have?

163
00:06:22,498 --> 00:06:25,001
Which one? I'm going to have all
three of them.

164
00:06:26,502 --> 00:06:28,004
All three of them?

165
00:06:28,004 --> 00:06:29,505
Certainly.

166
00:06:29,505 --> 00:06:32,008
Well, this, I got to see.

167
00:06:35,511 --> 00:06:37,513
Lucy!

168
00:06:37,513 --> 00:06:39,015
I'm home!

169
00:06:50,526 --> 00:06:52,528
(husky voice:)
Hello, darling.

170
00:06:59,035 --> 00:07:00,536
Hello.

171
00:07:00,536 --> 00:07:04,040
How'd things go at rehearsal,
darling?

172
00:07:06,042 --> 00:07:08,044
Fine.

173
00:07:08,044 --> 00:07:10,046
How'd things go here at home?

174
00:07:10,046 --> 00:07:11,547
Oh, frightful, darling.

175
00:07:12,048 --> 00:07:13,549
The phone woke me at the crack of
noon.

176
00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:15,551
Noel called.

177
00:07:15,551 --> 00:07:18,054
We chatted till 1:00, I bathed till
2:00

178
00:07:18,054 --> 00:07:20,056
turned down scripts until 3:00.

179
00:07:20,056 --> 00:07:23,559
Then Noel darling sent me the most
darling present.

180
00:07:23,559 --> 00:07:25,561
Oh, yes, it was a darling Cadillac.

181
00:07:25,561 --> 00:07:29,065
You should really see it, darling,
it's darling.

182
00:07:32,068 --> 00:07:34,570
What is this?

183
00:07:34,570 --> 00:07:36,572
What's what, darling?

184
00:07:39,075 --> 00:07:42,078
Why don't you cut it out and be
yourself, huh?

185
00:07:42,078 --> 00:07:44,580
I'd be happy to be myself if I could
remember who I am.

186
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:46,082
Who am I?

187
00:07:49,085 --> 00:07:50,586
Who are you?

188
00:07:50,586 --> 00:07:54,590
Well, don't you know either, buster?

189
00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:56,592
Buster?

190
00:07:56,592 --> 00:07:59,095
What kind of a gag is this?

191
00:07:59,095 --> 00:08:01,097
Now, Lucy, what are you trying to do?

192
00:08:01,597 --> 00:08:05,101
(with Southern drawl:)
Lucy... is that my name?

193
00:08:05,101 --> 00:08:08,104
Well, it was when I left here this
morning.

194
00:08:08,604 --> 00:08:12,608
Oh, do you live here, too?

195
00:08:12,608 --> 00:08:15,111
I have for the past five years.

196
00:08:15,111 --> 00:08:19,115
Oh, we better get married.

197
00:08:19,115 --> 00:08:20,616
We are married.

198
00:08:20,616 --> 00:08:22,118
Ha!

199
00:08:22,118 --> 00:08:25,621
You say that, but how do I know that
it's true?

200
00:08:25,621 --> 00:08:27,123
Honey, what are you talking about?

201
00:08:27,123 --> 00:08:29,625
You stay away from me, fresh.

202
00:08:29,625 --> 00:08:31,127
Fresh?

203
00:08:31,127 --> 00:08:33,629
I was told never to talk to strange
men.

204
00:08:33,629 --> 00:08:35,131
My mother told me...

205
00:08:35,131 --> 00:08:38,134
whoever she is.

206
00:08:43,139 --> 00:08:46,642
Honey, are you sure you're well?

207
00:08:46,642 --> 00:08:49,645
No, I'm not.

208
00:08:49,645 --> 00:08:51,147
Could it possibly be

209
00:08:51,147 --> 00:08:53,649
that you're suffering from magnesia?

210
00:08:57,153 --> 00:08:59,155
Amnesia!

211
00:08:59,155 --> 00:09:00,656
Oh, who am I?

212
00:09:00,656 --> 00:09:02,158
What am I?

213
00:09:02,158 --> 00:09:03,659
Where am I?

214
00:09:03,659 --> 00:09:05,661
Oh, honey...
Look, honey.
Look around you.

215
00:09:05,661 --> 00:09:08,164
Doesn't this place look familiar to
you?

216
00:09:08,164 --> 00:09:09,165
No.

217
00:09:09,165 --> 00:09:10,666
No.

218
00:09:10,666 --> 00:09:12,668
No.

219
00:09:12,668 --> 00:09:13,669
No.

220
00:09:13,669 --> 00:09:15,671
No.

221
00:09:15,671 --> 00:09:16,672
Oh!

222
00:09:18,674 --> 00:09:20,676
No.

223
00:09:23,179 --> 00:09:24,680
Oh, honey, now, come on, try to
think.

224
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:25,681
Honey, look...

225
00:09:25,681 --> 00:09:27,183
Oh, oh, honey, come here.

226
00:09:27,183 --> 00:09:28,684
Where?
Look. Look there. Look.

227
00:09:28,684 --> 00:09:31,187
Do you remember this picture?
I gave it to you.

228
00:09:31,187 --> 00:09:33,689
Oh, she's pretty.

229
00:09:33,689 --> 00:09:35,691
Who is she?

230
00:09:35,691 --> 00:09:37,693
Honey, I think you're really sick.

231
00:09:37,693 --> 00:09:40,696
May-May-Maybe you better go and lie
down, huh?

232
00:09:40,696 --> 00:09:42,698
All right, I'll go lie down.

233
00:09:42,698 --> 00:09:43,699
Yeah.

234
00:09:43,699 --> 00:09:45,701
Tha-That's not the bedroom, dear.

235
00:09:45,701 --> 00:09:46,702
Oh.

236
00:09:46,702 --> 00:09:47,703
That's not, either.

237
00:09:47,703 --> 00:09:49,205
Oh.

238
00:09:49,205 --> 00:09:50,206
No, honey, over...

239
00:09:50,206 --> 00:09:52,208
Honey, over here.
That's where the bedroom is.

240
00:09:52,208 --> 00:09:53,209
Oh.
Right here, honey.

241
00:09:53,209 --> 00:09:54,710
Oh.
Now, you take it easy, honey.

242
00:09:58,214 --> 00:10:02,218
You have a very lovely apartment
here, mister.

243
00:10:03,719 --> 00:10:05,721
Ay-ay-ay-ay-ay.

244
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:16,732
Hello.

245
00:10:16,732 --> 00:10:19,235
Hello, is Dr. Stevenson in?

246
00:10:19,235 --> 00:10:20,736
Oh.

247
00:10:20,736 --> 00:10:23,239
Well, look, please-please tell him to
call me

248
00:10:23,239 --> 00:10:24,240
as soon as he gets in.

249
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,742
Oh, this is Ricky Ricardo.

250
00:10:26,742 --> 00:10:27,743
Yes.

251
00:10:27,743 --> 00:10:29,745
It's about my wife.

252
00:10:29,745 --> 00:10:31,747
She's acting peculiar.

253
00:10:31,747 --> 00:10:34,250
Yeah, I know, I know.

254
00:10:37,253 --> 00:10:39,255
Well, this time it's even worse.

255
00:10:41,257 --> 00:10:42,258
What?

256
00:10:42,258 --> 00:10:44,260
Oh, I see.

257
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:47,263
I should humor her until-until the
doctor calls me.

258
00:10:47,263 --> 00:10:49,265
All right, all right, I'll humor her.

259
00:10:49,265 --> 00:10:50,266
Yes.

260
00:10:50,266 --> 00:10:51,267
Bye.

261
00:10:51,267 --> 00:10:53,769
(childlike voice:)
Hi!

262
00:10:53,769 --> 00:10:55,271
Hi!

263
00:10:55,271 --> 00:10:57,773
(tricycle bell ringing)

264
00:10:57,773 --> 00:11:00,776
You want to play with me, little boy?

265
00:11:00,776 --> 00:11:02,778
Will you?
Huh? Huh? Huh?

266
00:11:02,778 --> 00:11:04,780
Yeah, sure, sure, I'll play with you.

267
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:06,282
Take a lick of my sucker.

268
00:11:06,282 --> 00:11:07,783
Go on.

269
00:11:07,783 --> 00:11:09,785
Take a big lick.

270
00:11:09,785 --> 00:11:10,286
Go on.

271
00:11:10,286 --> 00:11:11,787
That's enough.

272
00:11:13,789 --> 00:11:16,292
(squealing gleefully)

273
00:11:19,295 --> 00:11:21,297
You want to play games, little boy?

274
00:11:21,297 --> 00:11:22,798
Sure, yeah, I'll play a game with
you.

275
00:11:22,798 --> 00:11:25,301
Okay, I'll be the leader.
You stay where you are.

276
00:11:25,301 --> 00:11:26,802
You want to play "May I?"

277
00:11:26,802 --> 00:11:27,303
Yeah, whatever you say.

278
00:11:27,803 --> 00:11:29,805
All right.
Okay, you stay right there, now.

279
00:11:29,805 --> 00:11:31,307
I won't, no.
Don't you go away.

280
00:11:31,807 --> 00:11:33,809
Okay, you take two giant steps.

281
00:11:33,809 --> 00:11:35,311
All right.

282
00:11:35,311 --> 00:11:36,312
May I?

283
00:11:36,312 --> 00:11:39,315
No!

284
00:11:39,315 --> 00:11:41,317
I want you to take me for a ride.

285
00:11:41,317 --> 00:11:42,318
All right.

286
00:11:42,318 --> 00:11:43,319
On my tricycle.

287
00:11:43,319 --> 00:11:44,320
Now, wait a minute...

288
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,322
On my tricycle!
On my tricycle!

289
00:11:46,322 --> 00:11:47,823
(groans loudly)

290
00:11:51,327 --> 00:11:52,328
All right.

291
00:11:52,328 --> 00:11:52,828
All right.

292
00:11:53,329 --> 00:11:54,330
All right, on the tricycle.

293
00:11:54,330 --> 00:11:55,331
All right.
I'll take you.

294
00:11:55,331 --> 00:11:56,832
I'll take you.
On the tricycle.

295
00:11:56,832 --> 00:11:57,833
All right.

296
00:11:57,833 --> 00:11:59,335
On the tricycle, I'll take you for a
ride.

297
00:11:59,335 --> 00:12:00,836
Whee! Whee!
Ring the bell!

298
00:12:00,836 --> 00:12:01,837
Ring the bell!
Ring the bell!

299
00:12:02,338 --> 00:12:03,839
Toot the horn!
Toot the horn!

300
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:05,341
Toot the horn!
All right!

301
00:12:05,341 --> 00:12:07,843
No eyes! No eyes!
Toot the horn! Toot the horn!

302
00:12:07,843 --> 00:12:11,347
(blathering)
All right!
All right!

303
00:12:11,347 --> 00:12:13,349
(grunting)

304
00:12:13,349 --> 00:12:16,352
(wailing)

305
00:12:16,352 --> 00:12:18,354
You pushed me!

306
00:12:18,354 --> 00:12:20,356
(crying continuing)

307
00:12:30,466 --> 00:12:31,967
(clucking tongue)

308
00:12:36,472 --> 00:12:37,473
Hi, Rick.

309
00:12:37,473 --> 00:12:39,975
Hello, Fred.

310
00:12:39,975 --> 00:12:42,978
How's Lucy? Does she still think
she's a child?

311
00:12:42,978 --> 00:12:44,980
Yeah.

312
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:47,483
She's in the bedroom with Ethel.

313
00:12:47,483 --> 00:12:48,984
They're playing jacks.

314
00:12:48,984 --> 00:12:50,986
Ricky, I got to tell you something.

315
00:12:50,986 --> 00:12:52,988
Not now, Fred.
Not now; later, please.

316
00:12:52,988 --> 00:12:54,990
Lucy is faking.

317
00:12:54,990 --> 00:12:56,992
Look, Fred, we'll talk about it
later.

318
00:12:56,992 --> 00:12:59,495
The most important thing right now is
her heal...

319
00:13:03,499 --> 00:13:05,501
What do you mean, she's faking?

320
00:13:05,501 --> 00:13:07,002
I was downstairs in the basement

321
00:13:07,002 --> 00:13:09,004
listening through the furnace pipe

322
00:13:09,004 --> 00:13:11,507
and I heard everything that Lucy and
Ethel said.

323
00:13:11,507 --> 00:13:13,509
Well, why didn't you tell me before?

324
00:13:13,509 --> 00:13:17,012
It took me an hour to get my head out
of the pipe.

325
00:13:19,515 --> 00:13:21,517
Why, that little monkey.

326
00:13:21,517 --> 00:13:24,520
She'll do anything to get in the act,
won't she?

327
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:26,522
Looks like.

328
00:13:26,522 --> 00:13:29,024
Oh, brother, I got a wonderful idea.

329
00:13:29,024 --> 00:13:32,027
I'm going to teach her a lesson she
will never forget.

330
00:13:34,530 --> 00:13:36,532
Are you phoning the doctor?

331
00:13:36,532 --> 00:13:37,533
No.

332
00:13:37,533 --> 00:13:38,534
(chuckles)

333
00:13:38,534 --> 00:13:41,537
I'm phoning an actor friend of mine,
Hal March.

334
00:13:41,537 --> 00:13:44,039
(phone rings)

335
00:13:44,039 --> 00:13:45,040
Hello.

336
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,542
RICKY: Hello, Hal?

337
00:13:46,542 --> 00:13:47,543
Who's this, Ricky?

338
00:13:47,543 --> 00:13:49,044
Yeah, this is Ricky.

339
00:13:49,044 --> 00:13:52,548
Listen, Hal, I got a job for you--
the part of a doctor.

340
00:13:52,548 --> 00:13:54,550
Good. What's the show?

341
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:57,553
Well, the show is called, uh...
"Getting Even with Lucy"

342
00:13:58,053 --> 00:14:01,056
and it all takes place right here in
my apartment.

343
00:14:01,056 --> 00:14:02,558
What?

344
00:14:02,558 --> 00:14:04,560
Yes, here's the way it goes.

345
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:07,062
Lucy's been pretending that she's
sick

346
00:14:07,062 --> 00:14:09,064
so that I'd feel sorry for her

347
00:14:09,064 --> 00:14:11,066
and give her a part in my new show.

348
00:14:11,066 --> 00:14:13,068
So I want you to come over here

349
00:14:13,068 --> 00:14:15,571
and pretend that you're a doctor,
see?

350
00:14:15,571 --> 00:14:17,573
And while you're giving her a checkup

351
00:14:17,573 --> 00:14:21,076
you will discover that she has a very
unusual condition.

352
00:14:21,076 --> 00:14:25,581
Uh... some rare tropical disease.

353
00:14:25,581 --> 00:14:26,582
(chuckling)

354
00:14:26,582 --> 00:14:27,583
Like what?

355
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:28,584
I don't know.

356
00:14:28,584 --> 00:14:29,585
Make it up.

357
00:14:29,585 --> 00:14:30,586
(laughing)

358
00:14:30,586 --> 00:14:32,588
Be tough to keep a straight face.

359
00:14:32,588 --> 00:14:34,089
It's an awful dirty trick, Ricky.

360
00:14:34,089 --> 00:14:35,591
Yeah, I know.

361
00:14:36,091 --> 00:14:37,593
Like they say in Mexico

362
00:14:38,093 --> 00:14:41,096
"Mi amigo, alla va el zorrillo."

363
00:14:41,096 --> 00:14:42,598
What's that mean?

364
00:14:42,598 --> 00:14:44,600
I'm a real stinker.

365
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:56,862
What comes after twosies?

366
00:14:56,862 --> 00:14:57,863
Threesies.

367
00:14:57,863 --> 00:14:59,365
Oh, yeah.

368
00:15:02,868 --> 00:15:03,869
(laughs)

369
00:15:03,869 --> 00:15:06,372
I'd forgotten how much fun this was.

370
00:15:06,372 --> 00:15:07,373
(chuckles)

371
00:15:07,373 --> 00:15:08,874
(knocking at door)
Yes?

372
00:15:08,874 --> 00:15:09,875
RICKY: May I come in?

373
00:15:09,875 --> 00:15:11,877
Oh, yes.

374
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:16,882
How do you feel, little girl?

375
00:15:16,882 --> 00:15:18,384
Oh, she's not at all well.

376
00:15:18,384 --> 00:15:19,885
She has a terrible fever.

377
00:15:23,389 --> 00:15:25,391
I feel fine, mister.

378
00:15:25,391 --> 00:15:26,892
I'm playing jacks.

379
00:15:29,895 --> 00:15:32,398
Oh, Ethel, it's all my fault.

380
00:15:32,398 --> 00:15:34,400
I wish she would snap out of it.

381
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:37,403
You know, I just decided to star her
in the club.

382
00:15:37,403 --> 00:15:39,905
Ricky, that's wonderful.

383
00:15:39,905 --> 00:15:42,908
Wow, what do you know?!
She got her memory back.

384
00:15:42,908 --> 00:15:46,412
Oh, yes, I know who I am.

385
00:15:46,412 --> 00:15:49,415
I'm Lucy, and you're Ricky.

386
00:15:49,915 --> 00:15:51,417
Ethel!

387
00:15:51,417 --> 00:15:52,918
Welcome home, honey.

388
00:15:55,421 --> 00:15:56,922
Well, when do we start rehearsal?

389
00:15:56,922 --> 00:15:58,424
Now, wait a minute, honey.

390
00:15:58,424 --> 00:15:59,425
Wait a minute.

391
00:15:59,425 --> 00:16:00,926
You know, you've been very sick.

392
00:16:00,926 --> 00:16:02,428
So I asked a doctor to come over.

393
00:16:02,428 --> 00:16:06,432
A doctor?

394
00:16:06,432 --> 00:16:07,433
But I feel fine.

395
00:16:07,433 --> 00:16:08,934
Oh, no, no, no, never mind that.

396
00:16:08,934 --> 00:16:09,935
But I feel fine.

397
00:16:10,436 --> 00:16:11,437
Doctor!

398
00:16:11,937 --> 00:16:13,939
Come in, doctor.

399
00:16:13,939 --> 00:16:15,941
This is my wife Lucy, doctor.

400
00:16:15,941 --> 00:16:18,444
How do you do, Mrs. Ricardo?

401
00:16:18,944 --> 00:16:19,945
I feel fine.

402
00:16:19,945 --> 00:16:22,448
Yeah.
Yeah. Well, would you remove this,
please?

403
00:16:22,448 --> 00:16:23,449
I-I won't need that.

404
00:16:23,449 --> 00:16:24,450
Excuse me.

405
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:26,452
(clearing throat)

406
00:16:31,457 --> 00:16:33,459
(humming)

407
00:16:48,974 --> 00:16:50,476
Well, now...

408
00:16:50,476 --> 00:16:52,478
Oh... oh...

409
00:16:52,478 --> 00:16:55,481
I'm glad you called me in, Mr.
Ricardo.

410
00:16:55,481 --> 00:16:56,982
Pretty bad, huh?
Oh, yes.

411
00:16:56,982 --> 00:16:59,485
Now, if you'll just open your mouth,
Mrs. Ricardo

412
00:16:59,485 --> 00:17:00,486
and stick out your tongue.

413
00:17:00,486 --> 00:17:01,487
Say, "Ah." Ah.

414
00:17:01,487 --> 00:17:02,488
Ah.
Ah.

415
00:17:02,488 --> 00:17:03,489
Ah.
Ah.

416
00:17:03,989 --> 00:17:04,990
Ah.
Ah.

417
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:06,492
Uh-oh.
Uh-oh.

418
00:17:10,996 --> 00:17:12,498
What is it, doctor?

419
00:17:13,999 --> 00:17:15,501
I don't know yet.

420
00:17:15,501 --> 00:17:17,503
Is it very bad, doctor?

421
00:17:17,503 --> 00:17:18,504
We'll have to see.

422
00:17:18,504 --> 00:17:20,005
Well, I feel fine.

423
00:17:20,005 --> 00:17:21,006
Yeah, well, I'm...

424
00:17:21,006 --> 00:17:23,008
Please, please, Mrs.
Ricardo, don't talk.

425
00:17:23,008 --> 00:17:24,009
You may need all your strength.

426
00:17:24,009 --> 00:17:25,511
Just hold that right there.

427
00:17:25,511 --> 00:17:26,512
Now, if you'll just turn around

428
00:17:27,012 --> 00:17:28,514
and give me a little cough, Mrs.
Ricardo.

429
00:17:28,514 --> 00:17:29,515
A little cough?

430
00:17:29,515 --> 00:17:30,516
(coughs)

431
00:17:30,516 --> 00:17:31,517
Louder.

432
00:17:31,517 --> 00:17:32,518
(coughs)

433
00:17:32,518 --> 00:17:33,519
Louder.

434
00:17:33,519 --> 00:17:37,022
(coughing repeatedly)

435
00:17:37,022 --> 00:17:38,524
Now, Mrs. Ricardo

436
00:17:38,524 --> 00:17:41,026
if you'll just give me one good
cough.

437
00:17:41,026 --> 00:17:42,528
(coughs loudly)

438
00:17:47,533 --> 00:17:50,035
Hmm, just as I feared.

439
00:17:50,035 --> 00:17:51,036
Oh...

440
00:17:51,036 --> 00:17:52,037
Well, what is it?

441
00:17:52,037 --> 00:17:53,539
You can tell me; I can take it.

442
00:17:53,539 --> 00:17:55,541
Frankly, Mrs. Ricardo

443
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:58,043
you've contracted a terrible,
terrible attack

444
00:17:58,043 --> 00:18:00,045
of the go-bloots.

445
00:18:02,047 --> 00:18:03,549
Go-bloots?

446
00:18:03,549 --> 00:18:06,051
Doctor, what kind of a disease is
that?

447
00:18:06,051 --> 00:18:08,554
Well, we doctors don't know too much
about it

448
00:18:08,554 --> 00:18:11,557
but there's a terrible epidemic of it
lately.

449
00:18:11,557 --> 00:18:14,059
It seems... it seems it came into the
country

450
00:18:14,059 --> 00:18:16,562
on the hind legs of the booshoo bird.

451
00:18:19,064 --> 00:18:23,068
I got the go-bloots from a booshoo
bird?

452
00:18:23,068 --> 00:18:25,571
Ew...

453
00:18:27,573 --> 00:18:30,075
Tell me, doctor, is it very, very
serious?

454
00:18:30,075 --> 00:18:31,076
Well, Mr. Ricardo

455
00:18:31,076 --> 00:18:33,078
I may as well be honest with you.

456
00:18:33,078 --> 00:18:35,581
If it gets worse, we may have to
operate.

457
00:18:35,581 --> 00:18:36,582
Operate?

458
00:18:36,582 --> 00:18:41,086
Yes, we'll have to go in and take out
your zorch.

459
00:18:44,089 --> 00:18:45,591
My zorch?!

460
00:18:45,591 --> 00:18:48,594
There's nothing wrong with my zorch.

461
00:18:48,594 --> 00:18:51,597
Now, now, don't be alarmed, Mrs.
Ricardo.

462
00:18:51,597 --> 00:18:55,100
Some people go on for years without a
zorch.

463
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:57,102
Well, is the operation painful?

464
00:18:57,102 --> 00:19:01,106
No, no, we anesthetize thoroughly for
a zorchectomy.

465
00:19:01,106 --> 00:19:03,609
Well, tell me, doctor, uh...

466
00:19:03,609 --> 00:19:07,112
would you be forced to remove the
entire zorch?

467
00:19:07,112 --> 00:19:13,118
Well, Mr. Ricardo, we may be very
fortunate and save half

468
00:19:13,118 --> 00:19:14,620
and as I always say

469
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:17,122
half a zorch is better than none.

470
00:19:17,122 --> 00:19:18,624
(others chuckling)

471
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:28,634
Of course, even if I'm able to save
half

472
00:19:28,634 --> 00:19:32,137
you'll never be able to...
trummel again.

473
00:19:32,137 --> 00:19:35,140
I won't?

474
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:37,142
Oh...

475
00:19:37,142 --> 00:19:38,644
What's trummeling?

476
00:19:38,644 --> 00:19:41,647
Well, it's an involuntary internal
process.

477
00:19:41,647 --> 00:19:43,148
Oh.

478
00:19:43,148 --> 00:19:46,151
Doctor, is there anything we can do
for her?

479
00:19:46,151 --> 00:19:48,654
All we can do is just wait.

480
00:19:48,654 --> 00:19:51,657
She should reach the crisis very
soon.

481
00:19:51,657 --> 00:19:55,661
Just wait and hope that she doesn't
turn green.

482
00:19:55,661 --> 00:19:57,663
Green!

483
00:19:57,663 --> 00:19:58,664
Yes, yes, green.

484
00:19:58,664 --> 00:20:00,666
That's the danger sign.

485
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:02,167
Well, what happens then?

486
00:20:02,167 --> 00:20:05,671
If you turn green, a half hour
later...

487
00:20:05,671 --> 00:20:07,172
(snaps) ...gone.

488
00:20:07,172 --> 00:20:09,174
Gone?

489
00:20:10,676 --> 00:20:11,677
Gone.

490
00:20:14,179 --> 00:20:16,682
(wailing)

491
00:20:21,553 --> 00:20:23,055
Deal me out, boys.

492
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:24,056
How's the patient?

493
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:26,058
Did the patient got rid of the
go-bloots?

494
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:28,560
I'm afraid not, Fred.

495
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,562
She just turned green.

496
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:31,563
Now, don't be silly.

497
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:34,066
There's no such thing as go-bloots.

498
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:35,067
(chuckling)
Thanks.

499
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:36,568
I know, I know...

500
00:20:36,568 --> 00:20:40,072
but there's such a thing as a green
light bulb.

501
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:41,573
You didn't...

502
00:20:41,573 --> 00:20:43,075
Yes, I did.

503
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:45,077
Oh, you rascal, you.

504
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:46,078
(laughing)

505
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:48,580
I sneaked in there when she was
asleep

506
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:51,083
and I put a green light bulb in the
lamp by her bed.

507
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:53,585
Well, how did you keep Ethel from
finding out?

508
00:20:53,585 --> 00:20:54,586
I sent Florence Nightingale

509
00:20:54,586 --> 00:20:56,588
to the drugstore for some aspirin.

510
00:20:56,588 --> 00:20:57,589
Oh, good.

511
00:20:57,589 --> 00:20:59,591
Now, listen, when she comes back

512
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:00,592
you better get her to bed.

513
00:21:00,592 --> 00:21:01,593
Why?

514
00:21:01,593 --> 00:21:04,096
Well, she told me that she's starting

515
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:06,598
to feel some pains in her zorch, too.

516
00:21:06,598 --> 00:21:08,600
Oh, no, no.

517
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,602
LUCY: Ricky! Ricky!

518
00:21:10,602 --> 00:21:13,605
Ricky!
Come on, the fun is about to begin.

519
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:16,108
Ricky!
I'm coming! I'm coming!

520
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:18,610
Ricky...
What's the matter, honey?

521
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:21,113
My hands, they're green.

522
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:22,114
Why, they are.

523
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:23,615
Your face is green, too.

524
00:21:23,615 --> 00:21:26,618
Oh, no! Give me the mirror, give me
the mirror.

525
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:29,121
Oh! Oh! Oh!

526
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:30,622
Oh, my face!

527
00:21:30,622 --> 00:21:32,124
And my hair!

528
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:35,127
Oh... Ricky... Oh!

529
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:36,628
Oh!

530
00:21:36,628 --> 00:21:38,130
You got the go-bloots, too.

531
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:41,633
What are you talking about?

532
00:21:41,633 --> 00:21:42,634
You're both green.

533
00:21:42,634 --> 00:21:43,635
We are?

534
00:21:43,635 --> 00:21:44,636
No, Fred.

535
00:21:44,636 --> 00:21:46,638
She doesn't know what she's saying.

536
00:21:46,638 --> 00:21:49,141
Fred, do I look green to you?

537
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:50,142
No.

538
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:51,643
You don't look green to me, either.

539
00:21:51,643 --> 00:21:53,145
Oh, no.

540
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:57,149
I'm looking at the world through
green-colored eyeballs.

541
00:21:57,149 --> 00:21:58,650
ETHEL: Lucy, here's your pill.

542
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:00,652
Take one of these, and you'll...

543
00:22:00,652 --> 00:22:01,653
(screeches)

544
00:22:01,653 --> 00:22:02,654
You're green.

545
00:22:02,654 --> 00:22:05,157
I've been sick.

546
00:22:07,659 --> 00:22:11,663
Oh... you poor little green thing.

547
00:22:11,663 --> 00:22:13,665
Oh, this is it, Ricky.

548
00:22:13,665 --> 00:22:16,168
This is it, I'm going.

549
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:17,169
Good-bye, Ethel.

550
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:18,170
Good-bye.

551
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:19,671
Good-bye, Fred.

552
00:22:19,671 --> 00:22:21,173
So long, chum.

553
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:22,674
Good-bye, Ricky.

554
00:22:22,674 --> 00:22:24,676
Now, wait a minute, honey.

555
00:22:24,676 --> 00:22:25,677
Don't go yet.

556
00:22:25,677 --> 00:22:27,179
Why not?

557
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:31,183
Well, I asked some of the boys in the
band to come over here

558
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:32,684
and play a farewell dirge for you.

559
00:22:32,684 --> 00:22:34,186
What'd he say?

560
00:22:34,186 --> 00:22:36,188
Some of the boys in the band came
over

561
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:37,189
to play a farewell dirge.

562
00:22:37,189 --> 00:22:38,690
Oh.

563
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:41,193
Well, I'll try to hang on.

564
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:46,198
I wouldn't want them to have made the
trip for nothing.

565
00:22:46,698 --> 00:22:49,201
Good girl, good girl.

566
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:50,702
All right, fellas!

567
00:22:50,702 --> 00:22:51,703
Fellas!

568
00:22:51,703 --> 00:22:53,205
Come in.

569
00:23:07,719 --> 00:23:09,721
All right, fellows.

570
00:23:09,721 --> 00:23:14,359
Now, please, this is the last music
that she will ever hear.

571
00:23:14,359 --> 00:23:16,862
So make it sweet.

572
00:23:16,862 --> 00:23:19,865
(strumming quiet intro)

573
00:23:22,868 --> 00:23:26,872
(playing loud Dixieland tune)

574
00:23:37,883 --> 00:23:39,885
(music)

575
00:23:57,903 --> 00:23:59,905
What kind of music was that?

576
00:23:59,905 --> 00:24:02,908
Yeah, watch it, will you, fellas? I'm
dying.

577
00:24:05,410 --> 00:24:07,412
Lucy, I have something to tell you,
honey.

578
00:24:07,913 --> 00:24:08,914
What?

579
00:24:08,914 --> 00:24:11,416
There's no such thing as the
go-bloots.

580
00:24:11,416 --> 00:24:14,920
How can you look me in my green eye
and say that?

581
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,922
Well, honey, you're not green either.

582
00:24:16,922 --> 00:24:17,923
Show her, Fred.

583
00:24:17,923 --> 00:24:19,424
All right.

584
00:24:19,424 --> 00:24:21,426
A green light bulb?

585
00:24:21,426 --> 00:24:22,928
(chuckling): Yeah.

586
00:24:22,928 --> 00:24:24,930
Then you mean I'm not really sick at
all?

587
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:26,932
No, honey, you're perfectly well.

588
00:24:26,932 --> 00:24:30,435
You were just pretending all the
time, you big bum.

589
00:24:30,435 --> 00:24:31,937
Now, wait a minute.

590
00:24:31,937 --> 00:24:34,940
Remember, you pretended first, you
know.

591
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:37,442
This makes us igual Pascual.

592
00:24:37,442 --> 00:24:38,944
What does that mean?

593
00:24:38,944 --> 00:24:40,946
That's "even Steven" in Spanish.

594
00:24:40,946 --> 00:24:43,448
(laughing)

595
00:24:43,448 --> 00:24:45,450
Come here.

596
00:24:45,450 --> 00:24:47,953
I guess you're right, honey.

597
00:24:49,454 --> 00:24:51,957
Mmm...

598
00:24:56,461 --> 00:24:58,463
(Lucy chuckles)

599
00:24:58,463 --> 00:25:00,465
(laughing)

600
00:25:00,465 --> 00:25:02,968
Well, when do we start rehearsing?

601
00:25:02,968 --> 00:25:03,969
Rehearsing?

602
00:25:03,969 --> 00:25:05,971
You said I could be the star of the
show.

603
00:25:05,971 --> 00:25:07,973
Now, wait a minute, honey. I only
said...

604
00:25:07,973 --> 00:25:09,474
Ricky, you promised me.

605
00:25:09,474 --> 00:25:11,977
You said I could be the star of the
show.

606
00:25:11,977 --> 00:25:14,479
I didn't force you to say it, you
know.

607
00:25:14,479 --> 00:25:16,982
Now, Ricky, you made me a promise
and...

608
00:25:16,982 --> 00:25:17,983
What's the matter?

609
00:25:17,983 --> 00:25:18,984
Ricky?

610
00:25:18,984 --> 00:25:21,486
Ricky, what's the matter?

611
00:25:21,486 --> 00:25:23,989
Ricky!

612
00:25:23,989 --> 00:25:25,991
Who am I?

613
00:25:27,993 --> 00:25:30,495
What am I?

614
00:25:30,495 --> 00:25:31,997
Where am I?

615
00:25:31,997 --> 00:25:33,498
Oh, I give up, I give up.

616
00:25:33,498 --> 00:25:35,000
You win.

617
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,002
(both laughing)

618
00:25:47,846 --> 00:25:50,732

(mouthing words)

7
00:01:20,663 --> 00:01:22,665
Hi, honey.

8
00:01:24,667 --> 00:01:26,669
Hey, did you see this evening's
paper?

9
00:01:26,669 --> 00:01:28,171
Listen to this.

10
00:01:28,171 --> 00:01:29,672
Uh, "The indisputed star

11
00:01:29,672 --> 00:01:31,674
"of a great evening entertainment

12
00:01:31,674 --> 00:01:33,176
"the genius of the conga drum

13
00:01:33,176 --> 00:01:35,678
"who, as usual, stopped the show last
night

"with his rendition of 'Babaloo'

Ricky Ricardo."

16
00:01:38,681 --> 00:01:41,684
Couldn't have been better if I wrote
it myself.

17
00:01:41,684 --> 00:01:42,685
How about that?

18
00:01:45,688 --> 00:01:47,690
(mouthing words)

19
00:02:13,716 --> 00:02:15,218
(spits)

20
00:02:42,745 --> 00:02:46,249
Lucy... what are you doing?

21
00:02:46,249 --> 00:02:48,251
I'm writing a play.

22
00:02:48,251 --> 00:02:50,253
You're writing a what?

23
00:02:50,253 --> 00:02:51,254
A play.

24
00:02:56,759 --> 00:02:59,262
And there it is... finished.

25
00:02:59,262 --> 00:03:01,764
125 pages dripping with drama

26
00:03:01,764 --> 00:03:05,268
dripping with intrigue, dripping with
excitement!

27
00:03:05,268 --> 00:03:07,270
I better get the mop.

28
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:09,272
Never mind.

29
00:03:09,272 --> 00:03:11,774
I wonder if Ethel's ready with her
costume.

30
00:03:11,774 --> 00:03:13,776
(stomping rhythm of "shave and a
haircut")

31
00:03:13,776 --> 00:03:15,278
(pounding "two bits")

32
00:03:15,278 --> 00:03:16,279
Good.

33
00:03:16,279 --> 00:03:18,281
Oh, I wonder what she looks like.

34
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:20,283
Uh, excuse me, Mrs. Shakespeare

35
00:03:20,283 --> 00:03:22,785
but, um... would you mind telling me

36
00:03:22,785 --> 00:03:24,287
what this is all about?

37
00:03:24,287 --> 00:03:26,289
Well, you see, all the women's clubs
in town

38
00:03:26,289 --> 00:03:28,291
are having a big playwriting contest.

39
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:31,294
I knew it, I knew it.

40
00:03:31,294 --> 00:03:33,296
This had to do

41
00:03:33,296 --> 00:03:36,799
with the Wednesday Afternoon Fang and
Claw Society.

42
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:39,802
It's the Wednesday Afternoon Fine
Arts League.

43
00:03:39,802 --> 00:03:41,804
Gee, just think, if our play wins

44
00:03:41,804 --> 00:03:44,307
I might become a big, famous
playwright.

45
00:03:44,307 --> 00:03:47,310
I might become another Tennessee
Ernie.

46
00:03:49,312 --> 00:03:50,813
That's Tennessee Williams.

47
00:03:50,813 --> 00:03:52,315
Oh.

48
00:03:52,815 --> 00:03:55,318
You know, that's a very interesting
name-- Tennessee.

49
00:03:55,318 --> 00:03:57,320
I wonder what I should call myself?

50
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:00,323
How about "South Dakota Ricardo"?

51
00:04:00,323 --> 00:04:02,325
No, it's not so good, is it?

52
00:04:02,325 --> 00:04:05,328
Why don't you tell them you were born
in Providence?

53
00:04:05,328 --> 00:04:07,830
Then they can call you "Rhode Island
Red."

54
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:12,335
Stop.

55
00:04:12,335 --> 00:04:15,838
Incidentally, how do you happen to be
the one

56
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:17,840
who's writing this play?

57
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,342
How do you think?

58
00:04:19,342 --> 00:04:22,345
You're the only one that has a
typewriter?

59
00:04:22,345 --> 00:04:23,846
No, smarty.

60
00:04:23,846 --> 00:04:25,348
I happen to be very close

61
00:04:25,348 --> 00:04:27,850
to the star who's going to play the
lead.

62
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:30,853
Oh? Anyone I know?

63
00:04:30,853 --> 00:04:32,855
Well, I-I can't reveal his name.

64
00:04:32,855 --> 00:04:34,357
I'm saving it for publicity.

65
00:04:34,357 --> 00:04:35,358
Uh-huh.

66
00:04:35,358 --> 00:04:37,360
Uh, this, uh...
this, uh, star

67
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,362
that is going to play the lead...

68
00:04:39,362 --> 00:04:42,865
his initials aren't "Ricky Ricardo,"
are they?

69
00:04:42,865 --> 00:04:44,867
Oh, don't be ridiculous.

70
00:04:44,867 --> 00:04:46,869
Hah! You flatter yourself.

71
00:04:46,869 --> 00:04:48,871
ETHEL: Da, da, da...

72
00:04:48,871 --> 00:04:51,374
(to the tune of "Habanera" from
Carmen)

73
00:04:51,374 --> 00:04:53,376
Da, da, da, Da-da, da, da, da.

74
00:04:55,378 --> 00:04:56,879
Could I help you, madam?

75
00:04:56,879 --> 00:04:57,880
That's Ethel.

76
00:04:58,881 --> 00:05:01,384
(yells)

77
00:05:01,384 --> 00:05:03,386
Ay-ay-ay-ay-ay.

78
00:05:03,386 --> 00:05:04,887
How do you like my costume?

79
00:05:04,887 --> 00:05:06,889
It's just wonderful, Ethel.

80
00:05:06,889 --> 00:05:08,391
Who are you supposed to be?

81
00:05:08,391 --> 00:05:09,892
Well, what do you think?

82
00:05:09,892 --> 00:05:12,895
The Bride of Frankenstein?

83
00:05:12,895 --> 00:05:13,896
Well!

84
00:05:13,896 --> 00:05:15,898
She's a Spanish senora.

85
00:05:15,898 --> 00:05:17,900
She suffers in the translation.

86
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:18,901
Oh...

87
00:05:18,901 --> 00:05:20,403
Are you ready for rehearsal?

88
00:05:20,403 --> 00:05:21,904
Rehearsal?

89
00:05:21,904 --> 00:05:23,906
You mean you finished the whole play
since dinner?

90
00:05:24,407 --> 00:05:25,408
Uh-huh.
It's only been two hours.

91
00:05:25,408 --> 00:05:27,910
Well, that's nothing for a famous
playwright

92
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:28,911
like "Rhode Island Red."

93
00:05:29,412 --> 00:05:29,912
Huh?

94
00:05:30,413 --> 00:05:31,414
Oh, he means me.

95
00:05:31,414 --> 00:05:32,915
Pay no attention to him.

96
00:05:32,915 --> 00:05:34,417
What did it turn out to be

97
00:05:34,417 --> 00:05:35,918
a comedy, a drama or an epic?

98
00:05:35,918 --> 00:05:37,920
She wasn't sure when she started.

99
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:38,921
Oh.

100
00:05:38,921 --> 00:05:39,922
A drama.

101
00:05:39,922 --> 00:05:40,923
Light or heavy?

102
00:05:40,923 --> 00:05:42,425
Well, about medium, I think.

103
00:05:42,425 --> 00:05:43,926
Well, that does it.

104
00:05:43,926 --> 00:05:46,929
Let me know when rehearsal is over.

105
00:05:46,929 --> 00:05:48,931
I thought maybe that you'd help us
out

106
00:05:48,931 --> 00:05:50,433
by reading the man's part.

107
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:51,934
Well, honey, if I'm not going to be
in it

108
00:05:51,934 --> 00:05:52,935
what good would that do?

109
00:05:52,935 --> 00:05:54,437
Well, uh...

110
00:05:54,437 --> 00:05:57,440
Oh, please, Ricky, won't you do it
for me...

111
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,942
and "Rhode Island Red"?

112
00:05:59,942 --> 00:06:00,943
Well, all right.

113
00:06:00,943 --> 00:06:02,445
If you put it that way, I will.

114
00:06:02,445 --> 00:06:03,446
Good.

115
00:06:03,446 --> 00:06:04,447
What is it all about?

116
00:06:04,447 --> 00:06:07,950
Well, it's a tender, moving,
heart-rending story

117
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:09,952
of a Cuban tobacco picker

118
00:06:09,952 --> 00:06:12,955
and his love for the plantation
owner's daughter.

119
00:06:12,955 --> 00:06:16,459
Wait a minute.

120
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:19,462
This play is all about a Cuban
tobacco picker?

121
00:06:19,462 --> 00:06:20,463
Yes, but don't worry--

122
00:06:20,463 --> 00:06:21,964
you're not going to be in it.

123
00:06:21,964 --> 00:06:22,965
Now, you go out in the kitchen

124
00:06:22,965 --> 00:06:24,467
and wait for your entrance cue.

125
00:06:24,467 --> 00:06:25,468
Now, go on.
Go on.

126
00:06:25,468 --> 00:06:26,469
All right.

127
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:27,970
Now, remember, Ethel

128
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:29,972
I am a gorgeous, dark-eyed beauty

129
00:06:29,972 --> 00:06:33,476
and you're my fat, ugly, old crone of
a mother.

130
00:06:33,476 --> 00:06:34,477
Fat?

131
00:06:34,477 --> 00:06:35,478
Yes.

132
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:37,480
Well, it'll take a lot of acting

133
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,481
but I guess I can do it.

134
00:06:38,481 --> 00:06:39,482
All right.

135
00:06:39,482 --> 00:06:40,983
Now, as the scene opens

136
00:06:41,484 --> 00:06:43,486
you're sitting outside your hacienda

137
00:06:43,486 --> 00:06:47,490
and you're rocking back and forth on
your veranda.

138
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:48,991
Now, you're seated there.

139
00:06:48,991 --> 00:06:50,993
You're rocking back and forth

140
00:06:50,993 --> 00:06:54,497
and you're singing, and I come out of
my hacienda.

141
00:06:55,998 --> 00:06:58,501
(screeching the "Habanera")

142
00:06:58,501 --> 00:07:01,504
La, la, la, la-la, la, la, la...

143
00:07:01,504 --> 00:07:03,005
(voice deepens)

144
00:07:03,005 --> 00:07:05,007
How long do I keep singing?

145
00:07:05,007 --> 00:07:08,010
Till I make my entrance.

146
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:10,513
La, la, la, la-la, la, la

147
00:07:10,513 --> 00:07:14,016
La-la, la, la, la-la, la, la, la...

148
00:07:15,518 --> 00:07:17,520
?Como esta, Mamasita?

149
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,022
"My bean, Lukita."

150
00:07:21,023 --> 00:07:23,526
"My bean, Lukita."

151
00:07:24,026 --> 00:07:26,529
That's "Muy bien, Lucita."

152
00:07:31,534 --> 00:07:33,035
Oh.

153
00:07:33,035 --> 00:07:35,037
Yeah.
"Muy bien, Lucita."

154
00:07:35,037 --> 00:07:38,541
Mamasita, how you like me in my new
dress?

155
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:41,043
"You look very pretty, Lucita.

156
00:07:41,043 --> 00:07:43,546
"Your hair is shining, your eyes are
bright

157
00:07:43,546 --> 00:07:46,549
and your nose is continued on the
next page."

158
00:07:51,053 --> 00:07:54,557
You don't read that-- that's the
directions.

159
00:07:54,557 --> 00:07:55,558
Well, how can I tell?

160
00:07:55,558 --> 00:07:56,559
It's all run together.

161
00:07:56,559 --> 00:07:58,561
Well, I typed it in a big hurry,

162
00:07:58,561 --> 00:08:00,563
Now, go on...
and read it with an accent.

163
00:08:00,563 --> 00:08:02,064
This is in Spanish.

164
00:08:02,064 --> 00:08:03,065
Oh.

165
00:08:03,065 --> 00:08:06,068
"Why are you all dressed up, Lucita?"

166
00:08:06,068 --> 00:08:09,572
Because I think I go for a walk
through the mango trees.

167
00:08:09,572 --> 00:08:11,073
"That's nice?"

168
00:08:11,073 --> 00:08:14,577
(nasal): "That's nice? That's nice?"

169
00:08:14,577 --> 00:08:16,579
What's the matter?
That's not a question!

170
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:18,581
Well, there's a question mark here.

171
00:08:18,581 --> 00:08:20,082
There is not.

172
00:08:20,082 --> 00:08:21,083
Look.

173
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:22,585
Oh. Well, there shouldn't be.

174
00:08:22,585 --> 00:08:24,086
You ought to know that.

175
00:08:24,086 --> 00:08:26,589
How should I ought to know that?

176
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:28,090
Well, go on, go on.

177
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:29,091
"That's nice.

178
00:08:29,091 --> 00:08:31,093
Do you go alone?"

179
00:08:31,093 --> 00:08:33,095
Si, I go alone.

180
00:08:33,095 --> 00:08:34,096
"Eh, eh, eh!

181
00:08:34,096 --> 00:08:37,099
I think you go there to meet your
liver."

182
00:08:37,099 --> 00:08:38,100
Lover!

183
00:08:44,607 --> 00:08:47,109
"I think you go there to meet your
lover

184
00:08:47,109 --> 00:08:50,112
"that worthless, good-for-nothing
tobacco picker.

185
00:08:50,112 --> 00:08:52,114
"How can you even look at him--

186
00:08:52,114 --> 00:08:54,617
you, the plantation owner's
daughter?"

187
00:08:54,617 --> 00:08:57,620
Shush, Mamasita, here he comes now.

188
00:08:59,121 --> 00:09:02,124
(louder): Shush, Mamasita, here he
comes now.

189
00:09:02,124 --> 00:09:04,627
Ricky, that's your cue!

190
00:09:04,627 --> 00:09:05,628
Oh.

191
00:09:05,628 --> 00:09:08,130
(chewing)

192
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:10,633
(garbled): Senora y senorita.

193
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:11,634
Buenas noches.

194
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:13,135
?Como estan?

195
00:09:13,135 --> 00:09:14,637
What are you doing with a sandwich?

196
00:09:14,637 --> 00:09:16,639
I didn't write that into the script.

197
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:19,141
Well, I got so hungry waiting for my
cue, I ad-libbed it.

198
00:09:19,141 --> 00:09:21,644
Well, swallow and come on.

199
00:09:21,644 --> 00:09:23,145
All right.

200
00:09:23,145 --> 00:09:25,648
Uh... "Buenas noches, senora y
senorita.

201
00:09:25,648 --> 00:09:26,649
?Como estan?"

202
00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:29,151
?Como esta, mi amor?

203
00:09:29,151 --> 00:09:31,654
"?Como esta, you big bum?"

204
00:09:31,654 --> 00:09:35,157
Oh, you pay no attention to Mama,
Fernando.

205
00:09:35,157 --> 00:09:36,659
She no feel well.

206
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:37,660
Now you kneel.

207
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:39,161
I kneel. All right.

208
00:09:39,161 --> 00:09:40,162
Uh...

209
00:09:40,162 --> 00:09:43,165
"I am sorry to hear you don't feel
well, Mamasita.

210
00:09:43,165 --> 00:09:46,168
Are you having trouble with your
lover?"

211
00:09:46,168 --> 00:09:46,669
Liver!

212
00:09:54,176 --> 00:09:56,679
"Are you having trouble with your
liver?"

213
00:09:56,679 --> 00:09:58,180
"No, I am not, Fernando.

214
00:09:58,180 --> 00:09:59,682
"I am feeling not well

215
00:09:59,682 --> 00:10:02,184
"because you are in love with my
daughter

216
00:10:02,184 --> 00:10:03,686
"but you have no way

217
00:10:03,686 --> 00:10:06,188
to make money to support her, do
you?"

218
00:10:06,188 --> 00:10:07,690
"No, I dun't."

219
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:12,194
No, Mama, he "dun't."

220
00:10:12,194 --> 00:10:14,196
Now, wait a minute, Wait a minute.

221
00:10:14,196 --> 00:10:16,699
Wh-What's the idea of making fun of
me in this play?

222
00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:18,200
Fun of you?

223
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:22,204
Yeah, look at the way you got "don't"
spelled: D-U-N-T.

224
00:10:22,204 --> 00:10:25,207
Well, that's a typographical error.

225
00:10:25,207 --> 00:10:26,208
Yeah?

226
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:27,209
Yeah, now go on.

227
00:10:27,209 --> 00:10:28,210
All right.

228
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:29,712
"Someday I will be

229
00:10:29,712 --> 00:10:31,213
"a big man, senora.

230
00:10:31,213 --> 00:10:34,216
I am learning how to play the conga
drum."

231
00:10:34,216 --> 00:10:37,720
Oh, yes, Mama, he make nice music on
the drum.

232
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,722
Lots of noise, Mama, yes.

233
00:10:39,722 --> 00:10:41,724
Mm-hmm.

234
00:10:41,724 --> 00:10:44,226
"Someday I will become famous

235
00:10:44,226 --> 00:10:46,228
"by singing a song called...

236
00:10:46,228 --> 00:10:48,230
'Babaloo'"?

237
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:50,232
LUCY: Uh, it's a very nice song,
Mama.

238
00:10:50,232 --> 00:10:51,734
iBabaloo! iBabaloo!

239
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:55,237
Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a
minute, wait a minute.

240
00:10:55,237 --> 00:10:57,239
Who is this Cuban tobacco picker

241
00:10:57,239 --> 00:11:00,242
who plays the conga drums and sings
"Babaloo"?

242
00:11:00,242 --> 00:11:01,243
Guess.

243
00:11:01,243 --> 00:11:04,747
Sir Cedric Hardwicke?

244
00:11:04,747 --> 00:11:06,749
No.

245
00:11:06,749 --> 00:11:09,251
John Charles Thomas?

246
00:11:09,251 --> 00:11:10,252
No.

247
00:11:10,252 --> 00:11:11,253
Lassie?

248
00:11:11,253 --> 00:11:12,755
All right, Ricky.

249
00:11:12,755 --> 00:11:15,257
I wrote the whole thing with you in
mind.

250
00:11:15,257 --> 00:11:16,258
No!

251
00:11:16,258 --> 00:11:17,760
Well, I thought when you read it

252
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,261
and you found out what a good part it
was

253
00:11:19,261 --> 00:11:20,262
you'd want to be in it.

254
00:11:20,262 --> 00:11:23,265
Well, Lucy, I realize that this part

255
00:11:23,265 --> 00:11:26,769
will make Laurence Olivier hop on the
next boat

256
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:29,689
but, uh... thanks just the same.

257
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:31,607
But Ricky, you've got to do it.

258
00:11:31,607 --> 00:11:32,608
Why?

259
00:11:32,608 --> 00:11:34,610
Well, because...

260
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:36,112
Because that's the only reason

261
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:37,613
they let Lucy write the play. (gasps)

262
00:11:37,613 --> 00:11:39,615
Lucy!

263
00:11:39,615 --> 00:11:42,118
You mean, you were just using me

264
00:11:42,118 --> 00:11:45,121
to further your own selfish purposes?

265
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:46,122
For shame!

266
00:11:46,622 --> 00:11:48,124
LUCY: But Ricky...

267
00:11:48,124 --> 00:11:49,625
I am sorry, I am not interested.

268
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:51,127
Get yourself a new boy.

269
00:11:51,127 --> 00:11:52,128
Good-bye.

270
00:11:52,128 --> 00:11:55,131
Ricky Ricardo, you'll regret this!

271
00:11:55,131 --> 00:11:57,633
Well, I'm pretty sure that I will

272
00:11:57,633 --> 00:11:59,635
but, uh, I'm sorry, Mrs. Playwright.

273
00:11:59,635 --> 00:12:01,637
Thanks for thinking of me.

274
00:12:01,637 --> 00:12:03,139
I will always treasure

275
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:07,143
this original carbon copy of your
masterpiece... forever.

276
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:10,146
Oh...

277
00:12:10,146 --> 00:12:13,649
Oh, Lucy, I'm sorry I had to open my
big, fat mouth.

278
00:12:13,649 --> 00:12:15,151
Well, don't you worry, Ethel.

279
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:16,652
There's a lot of actors in this town

280
00:12:17,153 --> 00:12:18,154
that'll jump at the chance

281
00:12:18,154 --> 00:12:20,406
and I'm going to call them right now.

282
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:22,241
Uh-huh?

283
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:24,243
Yes.

284
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:29,248
Well, yes, yes, it's an original play
for a woman's club.

285
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:33,085
Oh, yes, you'll be the star.

286
00:12:33,085 --> 00:12:34,053
How's that?

287
00:12:34,053 --> 00:12:36,055
Oh, no, we can't pay you anything.

288
00:12:36,055 --> 00:12:37,556
Well, you see, our club...

289
00:12:37,556 --> 00:12:39,058
Hello?

290
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:42,561
Hello?

291
00:12:42,561 --> 00:12:44,063
Hello...

292
00:12:44,063 --> 00:12:45,564
Oh.

293
00:12:45,564 --> 00:12:48,000
Good morning, Lucy.
How you doing?

294
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,001
Oh, awful.

295
00:12:49,001 --> 00:12:50,503
Actors are certainly peculiar.

296
00:12:50,503 --> 00:12:52,505
They won't work unless you pay them.

297
00:12:52,505 --> 00:12:54,006
Well, look, Lucy...

298
00:12:54,006 --> 00:12:56,509
Hmm?
as long as you haven't found anyone
to play the part

299
00:12:56,509 --> 00:12:58,010
I know someone who'll do it.

300
00:12:58,010 --> 00:12:59,512
Really?
Is he the right type?

301
00:12:59,512 --> 00:13:00,513
Oh, sure.

302
00:13:00,513 --> 00:13:02,014
He's a real Latin lover.

303
00:13:02,014 --> 00:13:03,015
I'll bring him in.

304
00:13:03,516 --> 00:13:04,517
Oh!

305
00:13:04,517 --> 00:13:06,519
Introducing Fernando.

306
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:08,020
Tah-dah!

307
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:10,523
(singing "Toreador Song" from Carmen)

308
00:13:10,523 --> 00:13:13,025
Ya, dya-da, dya, dya, dya-da, dya-da,
da.

309
00:13:13,025 --> 00:13:15,528
(snorts)

310
00:13:15,528 --> 00:13:19,031
Oh, Ethel, why do you always foist
Fred on me?

311
00:13:19,031 --> 00:13:19,949
Foist?

312
00:13:20,449 --> 00:13:21,450
Yes, foist.

313
00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:22,952
You're some Latin lover.

314
00:13:22,952 --> 00:13:25,454
Well, I took Latin in high school.

315
00:13:25,454 --> 00:13:27,456
Amo, amas, amat, amamus, amatis,
amant.

316
00:13:27,456 --> 00:13:28,958
What's the matter with that?

317
00:13:28,958 --> 00:13:30,960
But this is Spanish.

318
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:33,462
Do you know how to speak Spanish?

319
00:13:33,462 --> 00:13:35,965
Bonus nokas, sinura.

320
00:13:35,965 --> 00:13:38,968
There, he sounds just like Ricky.

321
00:13:38,968 --> 00:13:41,470
Yeah, he sounds like Ricky speaking
English.

322
00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:43,973
Well, maybe he doesn't look the part

323
00:13:43,973 --> 00:13:45,975
and maybe he can't speak Spanish

324
00:13:45,975 --> 00:13:47,476
but you'll have to admit

325
00:13:47,476 --> 00:13:49,979
there's one thing in his favor.

326
00:13:49,979 --> 00:13:50,980
What?

327
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:52,481
He's willing to do it.

328
00:13:52,481 --> 00:13:54,483
Oh, what a spot to be in.

329
00:13:54,483 --> 00:13:57,403
You know who's going to judge these
plays?

330
00:13:57,403 --> 00:13:59,872
A big movie producer, Darryl B.
Mayer.

331
00:13:59,872 --> 00:14:01,874
What a chance to be seen.

332
00:14:01,874 --> 00:14:02,875
Yeah, and I'm stuck

333
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:04,376
with Fat Freddy, the Latin lover.

334
00:14:04,376 --> 00:14:06,378
Oh, now, wait a minute, Lucy.

335
00:14:06,378 --> 00:14:07,379
Give us a break.

336
00:14:07,379 --> 00:14:08,881
Why, I'll go on a diet.

337
00:14:08,881 --> 00:14:10,382
Well, that isn't the only thing,
Fred.

338
00:14:10,382 --> 00:14:11,884
The important thing is the way you
sound.

339
00:14:11,884 --> 00:14:13,385
Can you speak any other language?

340
00:14:13,385 --> 00:14:15,387
Say, he can do British.

341
00:14:15,387 --> 00:14:16,388
He can?

342
00:14:16,388 --> 00:14:18,390
(imitating accent): Well, rather, old
thing.

343
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:21,894
I'll put you through to my secretary.

344
00:14:21,894 --> 00:14:23,896
Cheerio! Pip-pip!

345
00:14:23,896 --> 00:14:26,398
And all that silly sort of rot.

346
00:14:26,899 --> 00:14:27,900
Hey, that isn't bad.

347
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:29,401
How about you, Ethel?

348
00:14:29,401 --> 00:14:31,403
Oh, definitely, darling.

349
00:14:31,403 --> 00:14:32,905
Right-o, old bean.

350
00:14:32,905 --> 00:14:34,406
Good show, Deborah.

351
00:14:34,406 --> 00:14:35,407
Thank you.

352
00:14:35,908 --> 00:14:36,909
Ha-ha!
That's wonderful.

353
00:14:37,409 --> 00:14:38,410
How about you, Lucy?

354
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:39,912
Uh, let's see now.

355
00:14:39,912 --> 00:14:41,413
Uh... afternoon, Mater.

356
00:14:41,413 --> 00:14:43,415
Pater won't be down for tea.

357
00:14:43,415 --> 00:14:44,917
We just buried him.

358
00:14:44,917 --> 00:14:47,419
Had to-- dead, you know.

359
00:14:47,419 --> 00:14:48,420
(all laughing)

360
00:14:48,921 --> 00:14:49,922
Oh, this is great!

361
00:14:49,922 --> 00:14:52,424
I'll switch the whole thing to
England.

362
00:14:52,424 --> 00:14:53,425
Right-o?

363
00:14:53,425 --> 00:14:54,426
BOTH: Right-o!

364
00:14:54,426 --> 00:14:56,428
Right-o! Pip-pip, cheerio, here we
go.

365
00:15:04,753 --> 00:15:07,256
(in British accent:)
Well, there you are.

366
00:15:07,256 --> 00:15:08,257
(chuckles)

367
00:15:08,257 --> 00:15:10,759
Good morning, ladies.

368
00:15:10,759 --> 00:15:14,763
Would you pour me a spot of tea, my
dear louse?

369
00:15:16,265 --> 00:15:17,266
Louse?

370
00:15:20,769 --> 00:15:24,273
Oh... "My dear Louise."

371
00:15:24,273 --> 00:15:25,274
Hiya, Fred.

372
00:15:25,274 --> 00:15:26,775
Hi.

373
00:15:26,775 --> 00:15:29,278
I just came down to see if you want
to go to the fights.

374
00:15:29,278 --> 00:15:32,281
You know, Lucy is going to be in that
stupid play.

375
00:15:32,281 --> 00:15:33,282
I can't make it, Rick.

376
00:15:33,282 --> 00:15:34,783
Why not?

377
00:15:34,783 --> 00:15:36,785
Well, I'm going to be in the stupid
play, too.

378
00:15:36,785 --> 00:15:39,288
You are going to...?

379
00:15:39,288 --> 00:15:41,290
(laughing)

380
00:15:47,296 --> 00:15:49,798
(laughing mockingly)

381
00:15:54,303 --> 00:15:55,804
You mean to tell me

382
00:15:55,804 --> 00:15:57,806
you let them make a boob out of you?

383
00:15:57,806 --> 00:15:59,308
(laughing)

384
00:15:59,308 --> 00:16:01,310
All right, go ahead and laugh.

385
00:16:01,310 --> 00:16:04,813
Just wait till Darryl B. Mayer gets a
gander at my performance.

386
00:16:04,813 --> 00:16:06,315
Darryl B. Mayer?

387
00:16:06,315 --> 00:16:07,316
Yeah.

388
00:16:07,316 --> 00:16:10,319
What does he want with a corny
contest like that?

389
00:16:10,319 --> 00:16:12,821
He's just going to judge the whole
thing, that's all.

390
00:16:12,821 --> 00:16:15,824
Hollywood, here I come.

391
00:16:15,824 --> 00:16:17,326
(laughing)

392
00:16:17,326 --> 00:16:18,827
Darryl B. Mayer!

393
00:16:18,827 --> 00:16:21,330
Where you get an idea like that?

394
00:16:21,330 --> 00:16:22,831
It's in the morning paper.
Here.

395
00:16:22,831 --> 00:16:23,832
It is?

396
00:16:23,832 --> 00:16:25,834
Take a look at it yourself.

397
00:16:32,341 --> 00:16:35,344
Uh... Fred...

398
00:16:35,344 --> 00:16:36,345
old chum...

399
00:16:36,345 --> 00:16:38,347
old pal...

400
00:16:38,347 --> 00:16:39,348
old buddy...

401
00:16:39,348 --> 00:16:40,349
Yeah?

402
00:16:40,349 --> 00:16:42,851
We've been friends for a long time.

403
00:16:42,851 --> 00:16:43,852
Yeah.

404
00:16:43,852 --> 00:16:46,355
Well, I'm not going to let them do
this to you.

405
00:16:46,355 --> 00:16:47,356
You're not?

406
00:16:47,356 --> 00:16:48,357
No, sir.

407
00:16:48,357 --> 00:16:49,858
Old chum...

408
00:16:49,858 --> 00:16:50,859
old pal...

409
00:16:50,859 --> 00:16:51,860
Old buddy.

410
00:16:53,862 --> 00:16:57,366
I'm not going to let them make a boob
out of you.

411
00:16:57,366 --> 00:16:58,867
You're not?

412
00:16:58,867 --> 00:17:01,370
No, sir. I'm going to let them make a
boob out of me.

413
00:17:01,370 --> 00:17:04,373
And incidentally, let Mayer make a
star out of you.

414
00:17:04,373 --> 00:17:07,876
Fred, you hurt me when you say things
like that.

415
00:17:07,876 --> 00:17:15,884
You don't realize what a tremendous
sacrifice I'm making.

416
00:17:15,884 --> 00:17:19,388
and Lucy's would be worse than any of
them.

417
00:17:19,388 --> 00:17:21,890
Now, if Mayer sees you in a flop...

418
00:17:21,890 --> 00:17:23,892
you're finished.

419
00:17:23,892 --> 00:17:26,395
You know, I hadn't thought of that.

420
00:17:26,395 --> 00:17:27,896
I guess you're right.

421
00:17:27,896 --> 00:17:29,398
Of course I'm right.

422
00:17:29,398 --> 00:17:31,400
When is the play, tonight?
Yeah.

423
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:33,902
Well, I better go upstairs and
rehearse my part, eh?

424
00:17:33,902 --> 00:17:34,903
Well, here, take this.

425
00:17:34,903 --> 00:17:36,405
No, no, I-I have my own script

426
00:17:36,905 --> 00:17:39,408
but listen, don't say anything to
Lucy, eh?

427
00:17:39,408 --> 00:17:41,410
I want to surprise her, see?

428
00:17:41,410 --> 00:17:43,912
I don't, uh... I don't want her to
think

429
00:17:43,912 --> 00:17:46,415
that I'm trying to get into her play.

430
00:17:46,415 --> 00:17:48,917
Oh, then you are trying to get into
it.

431
00:17:48,917 --> 00:17:50,419
Now, wait a minute.

432
00:17:50,419 --> 00:17:51,420
All right, Rick...

433
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:52,421
old pal...

434
00:17:52,421 --> 00:17:54,423
old chum...

435
00:17:54,423 --> 00:17:55,924
old buddy...

436
00:17:55,924 --> 00:17:57,426
I'm not going to let you do it.

437
00:17:57,926 --> 00:17:58,427
Why not?

438
00:17:58,927 --> 00:18:00,929
Because the play is going to be a
flop--

439
00:18:00,929 --> 00:18:01,930
you said so yourself--

440
00:18:01,930 --> 00:18:03,932
and you can't afford to be in a flop.

441
00:18:03,932 --> 00:18:05,934
Well, Fred, you seem to forget

442
00:18:05,934 --> 00:18:08,437
one little thing that makes it
different.

443
00:18:08,437 --> 00:18:09,438
Oh, what's that?

444
00:18:09,438 --> 00:18:14,443
With me in it, how can it possibly be
a flop?

445
00:18:14,443 --> 00:18:18,447
Yeah, I did forget that.

446
00:18:18,447 --> 00:18:20,449
Adios.

447
00:18:20,449 --> 00:18:21,950
Adios.

448
00:18:26,238 --> 00:18:27,606
(applause)

449
00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:32,111
You have just seen Mrs. Glazingham's
play

450
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:35,114
entitled Pearl One, Drop Two

451
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:38,117
or Much Ado about Knitting.

452
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:42,121
(giggling)

453
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:45,124
Isn't that a dear title?

454
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:48,127
(giggling)

455
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:49,628
Knitting... I-I think...

456
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:51,630
Oh, well, anyway, um...

457
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:53,632
(clears throat)

458
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:55,134
That brings us

459
00:18:55,134 --> 00:19:00,139
to the Wednesday Afternoon Fine Arts
entry in our contest.

460
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:03,642
It was written by Mrs. Ricky Ricardo

461
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:07,146
and is entitled The Perils of Pamela.

462
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:11,150
Take it away, Wednesday Afternoon
Fine Arts League.

463
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:14,653
(applause)

464
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:16,655
A pip-pip and toodle-oo.

465
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:19,158
I wonder what could be keeping my
daughter Pamela.

466
00:19:19,658 --> 00:19:21,660
She should have been here a fortnight
ago.

467
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:23,662
(cowbell rings)

468
00:19:23,662 --> 00:19:26,165
Ah, there's dear old Pam now.

469
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:30,169
(thumping)

470
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:33,172
(banging)

471
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:36,675
Oh... oh, I must have been jolly well
mistaken.

472
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:39,178
There's obviously no one there.

473
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:43,682
Ah, here she comes now.

474
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:45,684
She's coming up the walk.

475
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:47,686
She must have had terrible trouble

476
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:50,189
tethering her 'orse.

477
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:10,709
Psst!

478
00:20:10,709 --> 00:20:12,211
Oh, daughter!

479
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:13,712
How you startled me!

480
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:16,215
Afternoon, Mater.

481
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:18,717
Afternoon, daughter.

482
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:22,721
Well, I don't mind telling you,
Mater, I've 'ad it.

483
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:28,727
Why, whatever do you mean, Pamela?

484
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:31,730
All morning long I was riding the
hounds

485
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:34,233
and frankly, I'm pooped.

486
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:37,236
Tired from riding the 'ounds?

487
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:41,240
Yes, and I do believe

488
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:46,245
Pamela, what you need is a spot of
tea.

489
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:47,246
Right-o, Mater.

490
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:48,747
That's it, a spot of tea.

491
00:20:48,747 --> 00:20:50,249
Thank you very much.

492
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:53,752
There you are.

493
00:20:53,752 --> 00:20:54,753
Thank you.

494
00:20:54,753 --> 00:20:56,755
May I have some sugar?

495
00:20:56,755 --> 00:20:57,756
Thank you.

496
00:20:57,756 --> 00:20:59,258
May I have some milk?

497
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:00,759
Thank you.

498
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:02,761
May I have a needle and thread?

499
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:04,263
Whatever for?

500
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:06,265
I have a nasty tear in my tea bag.

501
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:12,271
Pamela...

502
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:21,280
I've been wanting to talk to you.

503
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,781
What's the mater, Matter?

504
00:21:22,781 --> 00:21:24,783
Uh, what's the matter, Mater?

505
00:21:24,783 --> 00:21:27,786
It's about this Reggie you've been
going with.

506
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:28,787
Oh!

507
00:21:28,787 --> 00:21:31,290
Not another word, Mater.

508
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:36,295
I love the lad.

509
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:39,298
That's all that matters, Mater.

510
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:44,303
Well, we'll take this up with Pater
later.

511
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:45,804
Mater!

512
00:21:45,804 --> 00:21:47,306
Now, Pamela.

513
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:50,809
Oh, here comes Reggie now.

514
00:22:02,821 --> 00:22:04,323
Buenas noches

515
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:05,824
senora y senorita.

516
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:06,825
?Como estan?

517
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:12,831
LUCY: Ricky!

518
00:22:12,831 --> 00:22:14,333
Uh, uh...

519
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:15,834
Reggie!

520
00:22:15,834 --> 00:22:16,835
What happened?

521
00:22:16,835 --> 00:22:18,337
Uh...

522
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:20,339
Oh, I know, Mater.

523
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:21,340
You do?

524
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:22,841
Yes, Reggie's all dressed up

525
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:24,843
for the king's birthday ball.

526
00:22:24,843 --> 00:22:26,845
(chuckling): Oh, good show!

527
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:28,347
Yes, good show.

528
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:30,349
MAN IN AUDIENCE: I think it stinks.

529
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:32,351
Uh... uh, Reggie, what you need is

530
00:22:32,351 --> 00:22:34,353
a spot of tea and a crumpet.

531
00:22:36,355 --> 00:22:37,856
Si, Mamasita.

532
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:43,362
Si, Mamasita.

533
00:22:43,362 --> 00:22:45,364
I'm sorry you're not feeling well.

534
00:22:45,864 --> 00:22:48,367
Are you having trouble with your
liver?

535
00:22:48,367 --> 00:22:49,368
Um...

536
00:22:49,368 --> 00:22:50,369
What now?

537
00:22:50,369 --> 00:22:53,372
There will be a short intermission.

538
00:22:53,372 --> 00:22:54,873
(mouthing words)

539
00:22:57,376 --> 00:22:58,877
I don't know.
What's happen...?

540
00:22:58,877 --> 00:23:00,379
Ricky, what's the matter with you?

541
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:01,880
I never was so humiliated in my life.

542
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:04,383
What are you trying to do, ruin my
whole play?

543
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:05,884
Yeah, what are you trying to do?

544
00:23:05,884 --> 00:23:07,886
No, no, honest, I was trying to be
good.

545
00:23:07,886 --> 00:23:09,888
I just wanted to surprise you.
What happened?

546
00:23:09,888 --> 00:23:12,891
"What happened?" You're doing the
wrong script.

547
00:23:12,891 --> 00:23:13,892
We switched to British.

548
00:23:13,892 --> 00:23:14,893
This is the one we're doing.

549
00:23:14,893 --> 00:23:16,395
Oh, well, what are we going to do?

550
00:23:16,395 --> 00:23:17,896
Well, we'll just have to change

551
00:23:17,896 --> 00:23:19,398
so that we're all doing the same
thing.

552
00:23:19,398 --> 00:23:20,899
Oh, all right, all right.

553
00:23:20,899 --> 00:23:21,900
Oh, Lucy...

554
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:22,901
What's happened?

555
00:23:22,901 --> 00:23:24,403
What shall I tell the audience?

556
00:23:24,403 --> 00:23:26,405
Well, tell them that we're going to
change costumes

557
00:23:26,405 --> 00:23:29,408
and we're going back to the original
version, A Tree Grows in Havana.

558
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:31,910
Oh, I hope I don't get my "cheerios"
mixed up

559
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:33,412
with my "como estas."

560
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:35,414
You won't.
Come on.

561
00:23:35,414 --> 00:23:36,415
Oh, what shall we do?

562
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:38,417
Well, entertain them, Miss Mitchell.

563
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:39,418
Entertain them.

564
00:23:39,418 --> 00:23:40,919
Me?!

565
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:41,920
Sure, go ahead.

566
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,922
Oh, all right.

567
00:23:43,922 --> 00:23:46,425
I just happened to bring a poem.

568
00:23:50,962 --> 00:23:53,982
"By the shores of Gitche Gumee

569
00:23:53,982 --> 00:23:56,485
"By the shining big-sea-water

570
00:23:56,485 --> 00:23:59,488
"Stood the wigwam of Nokomis

571
00:23:59,488 --> 00:24:02,991
"Daughter of the moon, Nokomis.

572
00:24:02,991 --> 00:24:06,995
"Dark behind it rose the forest

573
00:24:06,995 --> 00:24:10,999
"Rose the black and gloomy pine trees

574
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:16,004
"Rose the firs with cones upon them

575
00:24:16,004 --> 00:24:17,506
Rose the..."

576
00:24:24,012 --> 00:24:28,517
We will continue with A Tree Grows in
Havana.

577
00:24:31,019 --> 00:24:34,022
La, la, la, la-la, la, la

578
00:24:34,523 --> 00:24:36,525
La-la, la, la...

579
00:24:36,525 --> 00:24:38,026
?Como esta, Mamasita?

580
00:24:38,026 --> 00:24:40,028
Muy bien, Lucita.

581
00:24:40,028 --> 00:24:43,031
How you like my dress, Mamasita?

582
00:24:43,031 --> 00:24:45,534
It is very pretty but why are you all
dressed up for?

583
00:24:45,534 --> 00:24:49,538
Because I go for a walk through the
mango trees.

584
00:24:49,538 --> 00:24:51,039
Do you go alone?

585
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:53,542
Si, I go alone.

586
00:24:53,542 --> 00:24:55,043
Eh, eh, eh!

587
00:24:55,043 --> 00:24:58,046
I think you go there to meet your
lover, Fernando

588
00:24:58,046 --> 00:25:01,049
that good-for-nothing, worthless
tobacco picker.

589
00:25:01,049 --> 00:25:04,052
Shush, Mamasita, here he comes now.

590
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:14,062
Chip-chip, heerio, and all that sort
of thing.

591
00:25:14,062 --> 00:25:16,565
Anyone for tennis?

592
00:25:21,570 --> 00:25:24,072
Oh, no.

593
00:25:24,072 --> 00:25:25,073
Oh!

594
00:25:25,073 --> 00:25:26,074
What happened?

595
00:25:26,074 --> 00:25:27,576
Oh...

596
00:25:33,815 --> 00:25:37,202
(theme music playing)

597
00:25:42,207 --> 00:25:45,210
The part of the Club Woman was played
by Myra Marsh.

598
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:49,214
The part of the Stage Manager was
played by Maury Thompson.

(theme music ending)

3
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:37,537
Good morning, honey.

4
00:00:37,537 --> 00:00:38,538
Good morning.

5
00:00:38,538 --> 00:00:40,540
What are you doing up at the crack of
dawn?

6
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:41,541
It's only 9:30.

7
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:43,043
Well, I'm trying to get out of here

8
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:45,545
without that little monster from next
door following me.

9
00:00:45,545 --> 00:00:46,546
Little Peggy Dawson?

10
00:00:46,546 --> 00:00:48,048
Yeah, yeah.
I can't get rid of her.

11
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:50,550
Ever since she found out that I'm
Ricky Ricardo

12
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:51,551
she's like a spook.

13
00:00:51,551 --> 00:00:53,053
No matter where I go, she's there.

14
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:56,056
She walks with me to the subway in
the morning

15
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:57,557
she shows up at rehearsal

16
00:00:58,058 --> 00:01:00,560
and the way she looks at me--
ay-ay-ay-ay-ay.

17
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:02,562
(laughing)

18
00:01:04,564 --> 00:01:07,067
Well, you know how teenage girls are.

19
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:09,569
They get these fabulous crushes on
men

20
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:11,071
for no reason at all.

21
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:12,572
Yeah, well, I...

22
00:01:12,572 --> 00:01:15,075
What do you mean, "for no reason at
all"?

23
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:16,576
Oh, you know what I mean.

24
00:01:16,576 --> 00:01:18,578
She thinks the sun rises and sets in
you.

25
00:01:18,578 --> 00:01:21,081
Of course, I don't know where she
ever got the idea

26
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:23,083
that you're the smartest, the
handsomest

27
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:25,085
the most talented man in the whole
world.

28
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:26,586
Neither do I.

29
00:01:26,586 --> 00:01:29,089
There are a few other men smarter
than I.

30
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:31,091
Why, you big ham!

31
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:33,593
Well, anyway, I can't go through this
cow-eyed routine

32
00:01:33,593 --> 00:01:34,594
for another morning.

33
00:01:34,594 --> 00:01:36,096
I got to get out of here.

34
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:37,597
Oh, now, you've got plenty of time.

35
00:01:37,597 --> 00:01:40,100
Nobody in their right mind would
expect you to be up

36
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:41,601
for another two hours yet.

37
00:01:41,601 --> 00:01:42,602
Oh, I guess you're right.

38
00:01:42,602 --> 00:01:44,604
Drink another cup of coffee.
I'll get your coat.

39
00:01:44,604 --> 00:01:47,107
All right, honey.
Thank you.

40
00:03:00,263 --> 00:03:02,265
Am I going crazy or something?

41
00:03:02,265 --> 00:03:03,266
No.

42
00:03:03,266 --> 00:03:04,267
(screams)

43
00:03:09,272 --> 00:03:10,773
Oh, Peggy.

44
00:03:10,773 --> 00:03:12,775
Good morning... Ricky.

45
00:03:12,775 --> 00:03:13,776
Good morning.

46
00:03:13,776 --> 00:03:14,777
Did I startle you?

47
00:03:14,777 --> 00:03:16,279
Oh, no, no.

48
00:03:16,279 --> 00:03:19,282
I always wash my hands in the coffee
every morning.

49
00:03:19,282 --> 00:03:21,784
My, that's interesting!

50
00:03:21,784 --> 00:03:23,286
Yeah. (chuckles)

51
00:03:23,286 --> 00:03:25,788
You go right ahead and eat your
breakfast.

52
00:03:25,788 --> 00:03:26,789
Don't let me bother you.

53
00:03:26,789 --> 00:03:29,792
Now, look, Peggy, I-I have something
to say to you.

54
00:03:29,792 --> 00:03:31,794
What?

55
00:03:31,794 --> 00:03:34,297
Uh...

56
00:03:34,297 --> 00:03:36,299
Well, now, look, uh, uh, Peggy

57
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:38,801
y-you're a very sweet girl, dear.

58
00:03:38,801 --> 00:03:41,304
(squeals): Oh, you called me "dear"!

59
00:03:41,304 --> 00:03:44,307
(squealing continues)

60
00:03:44,307 --> 00:03:46,809
Now I can die happy.

61
00:03:46,809 --> 00:03:49,312
Well, uh, look, look, Pe-Peggy...

62
00:03:49,312 --> 00:03:51,814
Yes, Ricky darling.

63
00:03:54,817 --> 00:03:56,319
I'll be right back.

64
00:03:59,322 --> 00:04:01,824
(whispering): Lucy, Lucy.

65
00:04:01,824 --> 00:04:03,326
What?

66
00:04:05,328 --> 00:04:06,329
This is not my day.

67
00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:07,330
(chuckles)

68
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:09,332
Look, Lucy, will you do me a favor,
honey?

69
00:04:09,832 --> 00:04:11,834
(squeals): Oh, you called me "honey"!

70
00:04:14,337 --> 00:04:17,840
Oh, now I can die happy.

71
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,342
Now, cut it out, will you?

72
00:04:19,342 --> 00:04:21,344
May I have your autograph, Ricky?

73
00:04:21,344 --> 00:04:24,347
Just tattoo it on my arm.

74
00:04:24,347 --> 00:04:25,848
Now, that's enough of that, honey.

75
00:04:25,848 --> 00:04:27,850
How am I going to get rid of her?

76
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:29,352
Why don't you disillusion her?

77
00:04:29,352 --> 00:04:30,853
How?

78
00:04:30,853 --> 00:04:33,856
Just go in there and be mean and
nasty and unattractive.

79
00:04:33,856 --> 00:04:36,359
I'm not that good an actor.

80
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:39,862
There must be some way.

81
00:04:39,862 --> 00:04:41,364
Of course.

82
00:04:41,364 --> 00:04:44,367
I know the perfect way for me to
straighten her out.

83
00:04:44,367 --> 00:04:45,368
How?

84
00:04:45,368 --> 00:04:46,369
You talk to her.

85
00:04:46,369 --> 00:04:48,371
Me?
Yep. I got to go to rehearsal.

86
00:04:48,371 --> 00:04:49,372
Good-bye, honey.

87
00:04:49,372 --> 00:04:50,873
But Ricky, what'll I say?

88
00:04:50,873 --> 00:04:53,376
Well, honey, you're so clever, you'll
think of something.

89
00:04:53,376 --> 00:04:54,377
Good-bye.

90
00:04:54,377 --> 00:04:55,878
Good-bye, you coward.

91
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:00,800
(screams)

92
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,801
Oh, Peggy...

93
00:05:01,801 --> 00:05:03,303
Oh, Peggy, you scared me.

94
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:05,305
Is Mr. Ricardo ready to go to work?

95
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:06,306
He's gone.

96
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:07,807
Oh! Gosh, I'll have to catch up with
him.

97
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:09,309
Oh, now, Peggy, wait a minute.

98
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:11,311
But I walk him to the subway every
morning.

99
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:13,313
Yeah, well, he's a big boy now.

100
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:14,814
He can find it by himself.

101
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:15,815
Uh, sit down, Peggy.

102
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:17,317
I want to have a little talk with
you.

103
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:18,318
All right.

104
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:20,320
That's a good idea, really.

105
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,822
I want to have a talk with you, too.

106
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:31,331
Now, look, Peggy...

107
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:34,834
Mrs. Ricardo, let's be adult about
this.

108
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:37,337
I'm in love with your husband.

109
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:40,340
Are you sure about what you're
saying, Peggy?

110
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:43,343
Do you know it's love and not
infatuation?

111
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:44,344
Oh, yes.

112
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:46,846
My infatuations only last a little
while.

113
00:05:46,846 --> 00:05:49,349
This has been going on for two whole
weeks.

114
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:52,852
"Two whole weeks."

115
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:55,355
Well, there's a little thing you
overlooked, Peggy--

116
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:56,356
Ricky is married.

117
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:57,357
I know.

118
00:05:57,357 --> 00:05:58,858
Doesn't that make it sophisticated?

119
00:05:58,858 --> 00:06:00,860
Well, yes.

120
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:04,364
And he's so much more worldly than
the boys I know.

121
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:05,365
Well, I should hope so.

122
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:06,866
He's a little older, too.

123
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:09,369
I know-- he's middle-aged.

124
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:11,871
What?

125
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:14,374
He must be pushing 23.

126
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:18,378
Yeah, he's pushing 23, all right.

127
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:21,381
In fact, he's pushed it all the way
to 35.

128
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:28,388
I suppose you think that I'm pushing
23, too?

129
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:29,389
Oh, no.

130
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:32,392
A woman can always tell another
woman's age.

131
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:37,397
Yes, well...
now, about Ricky.

132
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:39,899
You know, there's another thing you
overlooked, Peggy.

133
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:41,401
What?
I love him, too.

134
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:42,902
(sighs)

135
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:44,404
I was afraid of that.

136
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:47,407
You're going to be terrific
competition.

137
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:48,408
Well, thanks.

138
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:51,411
Gosh, you've got that certain
something.

139
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:53,913
Well, that's-that's quite a
compliment

140
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:55,915
but, uh, how would a girl your age
know

141
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:57,917
that I have that certain something?

142
00:06:57,917 --> 00:07:00,920
I can tell by the way my mother looks
at my father

143
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,922
when my father looks at you.

144
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:08,928
I hope we can get this settled by
Saturday night

145
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:11,931
so that Ricky can take me to the
school dance.

146
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:14,934
Well, now, look, Peggy, I want to
have a talk with you

147
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:16,936
not as a rival but as a... a...

148
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:19,439
A mother?

149
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:21,941
No, a friend.

150
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:24,444
Now, what about boys your own age?

151
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:26,446
Oh, they're all so icky.

152
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:27,947
They're icky, huh?

153
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:29,949
Yeah...
except Arthur!

154
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:30,950
Arthur?

155
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:32,452
Arthur Morton.

156
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:33,453
He's wonderful.

157
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:40,460
He's got curly hair, big sad eyes and
floppy ears.

158
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,462
He looks like Gregory Peck.

159
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:45,965
Sounds more like Lassie.

160
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:48,968
But if you like Arthur so much

161
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:51,471
why don't you go to the school dance
with him?

162
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:53,473
Oh, he's too shy to ask me.

163
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:55,475
Well, why don't you ask him?

164
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:56,976
He doesn't know how to dance.

165
00:07:56,976 --> 00:07:59,479
Oh.
Well, how about this?

166
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:01,481
Now, suppose someone taught him to
dance by Saturday.

167
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:02,482
Would you ask him to take you?

168
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:03,983
Oh, sure.

169
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:05,485
Okay, I'll teach him.

170
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:10,990
Do you still know how to dance?

171
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:16,496
I think I can recall a few variations
on the turkey trot.

172
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:19,999
Now, look, you tell Arthur to come
here right after school

173
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,001
and have his first lesson.

174
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:24,003
Okay. Oh, gosh, I'm going to be late.

175
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:25,004
Oh, uh, Mrs. Ricardo?

176
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:26,005
Yes?

177
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:28,508
Don't say anything about Arthur.

178
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:32,011
I don't want Ricky to know that...
I'm untrue.

179
00:08:32,011 --> 00:08:34,514
Well, your secret is safe, Peggy.

180
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:37,016
Gee, you're keen.

181
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:38,518
Bye.

182
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:40,520
Bye.

183
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:41,521
(door closes)

184
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:44,524
"Gee, you're keen."

185
00:08:49,312 --> 00:08:50,813
(doorbell buzzes)

186
00:09:02,825 --> 00:09:04,327
Arthur?

187
00:09:06,329 --> 00:09:08,331
Come in, Arthur.

188
00:09:09,832 --> 00:09:11,334
Come in.

189
00:09:16,839 --> 00:09:18,341
How do you do?

190
00:09:18,341 --> 00:09:19,842
I'm Mrs. Ricardo.

191
00:09:19,842 --> 00:09:21,844
Won't you sit down?

192
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:29,352
Can I get you a drink of water?

193
00:09:31,354 --> 00:09:33,356
Arthur, say something!

194
00:09:33,856 --> 00:09:36,859
I think I'm going to faint.

195
00:09:38,861 --> 00:09:39,862
Now, nonsense.

196
00:09:39,862 --> 00:09:41,864
There's nothing to be shy about.

197
00:09:41,864 --> 00:09:45,368
I'm just going to teach you how to
dance, that's all.

198
00:09:45,368 --> 00:09:47,370
Well, look, we'll start this way.

199
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:48,871
Now, you just watch my feet.

200
00:09:48,871 --> 00:09:52,875
Now, one, two, three, four.

201
00:09:52,875 --> 00:09:55,378
One, two, three, four.

202
00:09:55,378 --> 00:09:56,379
That's all there is to it.

203
00:09:56,879 --> 00:09:58,881
Oh, is that all?

204
00:09:58,881 --> 00:10:00,383
Yeah. Now, you try it.

205
00:10:00,383 --> 00:10:03,886
Now, one, two, three, four.

206
00:10:03,886 --> 00:10:05,888
One, two, three, four.

207
00:10:06,389 --> 00:10:07,390
One, two...

208
00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:08,391
Arthur, Arthur...

209
00:10:08,391 --> 00:10:09,892
take shorter steps.

210
00:10:09,892 --> 00:10:12,895
You'll be dancing with a girl, not an
antelope.

211
00:10:12,895 --> 00:10:15,398
Oh.

212
00:10:15,398 --> 00:10:16,899
Now, try it again.

213
00:10:16,899 --> 00:10:20,403
Now, one, two, three, four.

214
00:10:20,403 --> 00:10:22,405
One, two, sidestep.

215
00:10:22,405 --> 00:10:25,408
That's right, sidestep, that's it.

216
00:10:25,908 --> 00:10:27,910
Gee, is this all there is to dancing?

217
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:28,911
Yes.

218
00:10:28,911 --> 00:10:30,413
Well, this is easy.

219
00:10:30,413 --> 00:10:31,914
Yeah, I knew you'd catch on.

220
00:10:31,914 --> 00:10:32,915
There now.

221
00:10:32,915 --> 00:10:34,417
Let's try it together.

222
00:10:34,417 --> 00:10:35,918
(gasps)

223
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,922
Oh, now, come on, Arthur.

224
00:10:39,922 --> 00:10:41,924
What are you going to do to me?

225
00:10:42,425 --> 00:10:43,926
I'm not going to do anything to you.

226
00:10:43,926 --> 00:10:45,928
We're just going to dance together.

227
00:10:45,928 --> 00:10:49,932
You mean...
just the two of us?

228
00:10:49,932 --> 00:10:52,935
Yes, that's the usual number.

229
00:10:52,935 --> 00:10:56,439
Mrs. Ricardo, I can't dance with you.

230
00:10:56,439 --> 00:10:58,941
(chuckling): You're a... a woman.

231
00:10:58,941 --> 00:11:01,944
Yeah, my husband likes me that way.

232
00:11:01,944 --> 00:11:06,449
Well, I don't know...
a... a woman...

233
00:11:06,449 --> 00:11:07,450
Now, look, Arthur

234
00:11:07,450 --> 00:11:09,952
some people are men and some people
are women.

235
00:11:09,952 --> 00:11:13,456
They're made that way so they can
dance together.

236
00:11:16,459 --> 00:11:18,461
Now, come on.
Take hold of me.

237
00:11:21,464 --> 00:11:24,467
Oh, Arthur, we're not dancing the
minuet.

238
00:11:24,467 --> 00:11:26,469
Put your arms around me.

239
00:11:29,972 --> 00:11:31,974
Oh, I couldn't.

240
00:11:32,475 --> 00:11:34,477
Now, don't be silly.

241
00:11:34,477 --> 00:11:35,978
Now, come on.

242
00:11:35,978 --> 00:11:36,979
Now, just follow me.

243
00:11:36,979 --> 00:11:37,980
Now, come on.

244
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:40,483
Now, one, two, three, four.

245
00:11:40,483 --> 00:11:41,984
One, two, three, four.

246
00:11:41,984 --> 00:11:43,486
Arthur, relax.

247
00:11:43,486 --> 00:11:44,987
Relax, now.

248
00:11:44,987 --> 00:11:46,489
Loosen up, come on.

249
00:11:46,489 --> 00:11:49,492
Just let yourself go loose, that's
all.

250
00:11:49,492 --> 00:11:51,494
Now, just relax.

251
00:11:51,494 --> 00:11:52,995
Now, come on, follow me.

252
00:11:52,995 --> 00:11:53,996
Now, relax.

253
00:11:53,996 --> 00:11:55,498
Now, be light on your feet, now.

254
00:11:55,498 --> 00:11:56,499
Li-Light on my feet.

255
00:11:56,999 --> 00:11:58,501
Yeah. Now, follow me.

256
00:11:58,501 --> 00:12:00,503
One, two, three, four.

257
00:12:00,503 --> 00:12:02,004
One, two, three, four.

258
00:12:02,004 --> 00:12:03,506
(toe cracks/screams)

259
00:12:03,506 --> 00:12:05,508
Oh! Oh, gosh!

260
00:12:06,008 --> 00:12:07,510
I'm sorry.

261
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:09,011
Oh, that's all right.

262
00:12:09,011 --> 00:12:10,513
Okay.

263
00:12:10,513 --> 00:12:12,515
Now, come on, let's try it again.

264
00:12:12,515 --> 00:12:14,016
Light on my feet.

265
00:12:14,016 --> 00:12:15,518
Yeah.
Now, try it again.

266
00:12:15,518 --> 00:12:17,520
Now, one, two, three, four.

267
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:18,521
One, two...

268
00:12:18,521 --> 00:12:19,522
three, four...
One...

269
00:12:19,522 --> 00:12:20,523
(toe cracks/yells)

270
00:12:20,523 --> 00:12:22,525
Oh! Oh!

271
00:12:22,525 --> 00:12:24,026
I-I'm sorry.
I did it again.

272
00:12:24,026 --> 00:12:26,529
You don't think this last time broke
it?

273
00:12:27,029 --> 00:12:29,031
No, the first time broke it.

274
00:12:31,033 --> 00:12:33,536
Well, I'll try to be more careful.

275
00:12:33,536 --> 00:12:35,538
Okay, now, come on.

276
00:12:35,538 --> 00:12:36,539
Light on my feet.

277
00:12:36,539 --> 00:12:38,541
Yeah, light on your feet.

278
00:12:38,541 --> 00:12:39,542
Come on.

279
00:12:39,542 --> 00:12:42,044
One, two, three, four.

280
00:12:42,044 --> 00:12:44,046
One, two, three, four.

281
00:12:44,046 --> 00:12:45,548
One, two, three, four.

282
00:12:45,548 --> 00:12:48,050
That's right, now you're getting it.

283
00:12:48,050 --> 00:12:49,552
There, that's fine.

284
00:12:49,552 --> 00:12:52,054
Now we'll try it with the music.

285
00:12:52,054 --> 00:12:54,056
Well, Arthur, let me go.

286
00:12:58,060 --> 00:12:59,562
Arthur, what's the matter with you?

287
00:12:59,562 --> 00:13:00,563
Why don't you let me go?

288
00:13:01,063 --> 00:13:03,065
I like it.

289
00:13:06,068 --> 00:13:07,069
But, Arthur...

290
00:13:07,069 --> 00:13:08,070
Mrs. Ricardo...

291
00:13:08,070 --> 00:13:09,071
What?

292
00:13:09,071 --> 00:13:10,072
I love you.

293
00:13:10,072 --> 00:13:12,074
What do you mean, you love me?

294
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:14,076
I love you.
I love you!

295
00:13:14,076 --> 00:13:16,579
Arthur, relax, now, relax.

296
00:13:16,579 --> 00:13:17,580
Calm down.

297
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:19,582
Now, relax.

298
00:13:19,582 --> 00:13:21,083
Gosh, this is the first time

299
00:13:21,083 --> 00:13:23,085
I've ever had my arms around a woman.

300
00:13:23,085 --> 00:13:26,088
Now I know what all the fellas are
talking about.

301
00:13:28,090 --> 00:13:29,091
Now, Arthur.

302
00:13:29,592 --> 00:13:30,593
I love you.

303
00:13:30,593 --> 00:13:31,594
Stop saying that.

304
00:13:31,594 --> 00:13:33,596
Now, Arthur, th-there's a big
misunderstanding.

305
00:13:34,096 --> 00:13:35,097
You better go now.

306
00:13:35,097 --> 00:13:37,099
No, I'm never going away from you,
ever.

307
00:13:37,099 --> 00:13:38,100
Now, Arthur...

308
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:39,602
Let's dance some more.

309
00:13:39,602 --> 00:13:41,604
No, no, you dance by yourself.

310
00:13:41,604 --> 00:13:42,605
Oh, no.

311
00:13:42,605 --> 00:13:43,606
Come on, now.

312
00:13:43,606 --> 00:13:45,107
Let's see how much you've learned

313
00:13:45,107 --> 00:13:47,109
and then, maybe I'll dance with you.

314
00:13:47,109 --> 00:13:48,110
Now, go on.

315
00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:49,612
Well... all right.

316
00:13:49,612 --> 00:13:50,613
Now...

317
00:13:50,613 --> 00:13:53,115
one, two, sidestep.

318
00:13:53,115 --> 00:13:55,117
Three, four, sidestep.

319
00:13:55,117 --> 00:13:57,119
That's it, sidestep.

320
00:13:57,119 --> 00:13:59,121
Three, four, sidestep.

321
00:13:59,121 --> 00:14:02,124
Sidestep, sidestep, sidestep.

322
00:14:02,124 --> 00:14:05,628
That's it, sidestep, sidestep, three,
four.

323
00:14:05,628 --> 00:14:08,130
Sidestep, that's it.

324
00:14:08,130 --> 00:14:09,131
(sighs)

325
00:14:09,131 --> 00:14:10,132
(sidestepping continues)

326
00:14:10,633 --> 00:14:12,134
The stairs!

327
00:14:12,134 --> 00:14:13,636
Arthur, watch out for the st...

328
00:14:13,636 --> 00:14:15,137
(crashes)

329
00:14:15,137 --> 00:14:16,138
Oh, no!

330
00:14:30,135 --> 00:14:32,137
Hi, honey.

331
00:14:32,137 --> 00:14:33,639
Hi.

332
00:14:35,641 --> 00:14:36,642
What's the matter?

333
00:14:36,642 --> 00:14:39,144
I gave Arthur a dancing lesson.

334
00:14:39,144 --> 00:14:40,646
Arthur? Arthur who?

335
00:14:40,646 --> 00:14:43,148
Well, believe me, it wasn't Arthur
Murray.

336
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:47,152
Would you mind telling a poor
confused Cuban

337
00:14:47,152 --> 00:14:48,654
what you're talking about?

338
00:14:48,654 --> 00:14:50,656
Well, after you left this morning

339
00:14:50,656 --> 00:14:52,658
I had that little chat with Peggy.

340
00:14:52,658 --> 00:14:54,159
Yeah?

341
00:14:54,159 --> 00:14:56,662
And she said that she liked a boy
named Arthur Morton

342
00:14:56,662 --> 00:14:58,664
Yeah?
but that he didn't know how to dance.

343
00:14:58,664 --> 00:15:00,165
So I had Arthur come over here

344
00:15:00,165 --> 00:15:04,169
and I gave him a dancing lesson to
get Peggy off your neck.

345
00:15:04,169 --> 00:15:05,671
What are you whispering about?

346
00:15:05,671 --> 00:15:09,675
If my feet ever find out that it was
my idea

347
00:15:09,675 --> 00:15:11,176
they'll kill me.

348
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:17,182
Well, I knew you'd figure a simple
way

349
00:15:17,182 --> 00:15:19,184
to clear the entire situation.

350
00:15:19,184 --> 00:15:20,686
Simple? I may never walk again.

351
00:15:22,688 --> 00:15:24,690
Well, listen, honey, thank you very
much.

352
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:26,191
Can I forget about Peggy now?

353
00:15:26,191 --> 00:15:27,192
I hope so.

354
00:15:27,192 --> 00:15:29,194
Hey, you know, this Arthur was so shy

355
00:15:29,194 --> 00:15:31,697
I practically had to lasso him to get
him in here.

356
00:15:31,697 --> 00:15:32,698
No kidding?

357
00:15:32,698 --> 00:15:34,199
Yeah. It was really unbelievable.

358
00:15:34,199 --> 00:15:35,701
And then, after we'd been dancing

359
00:15:35,701 --> 00:15:38,203
for a couple of minutes, he suddenly
looked me in the eye

360
00:15:38,203 --> 00:15:40,205
and said, "I love you."

361
00:15:40,205 --> 00:15:41,206
Oh, no.

362
00:15:41,206 --> 00:15:42,708
Yeah.

363
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:44,209
That's very funny.

364
00:15:44,209 --> 00:15:46,712
In love with you!

365
00:15:46,712 --> 00:15:49,214
(laughing)

366
00:15:51,717 --> 00:15:53,218
That's a scream.

367
00:15:53,218 --> 00:15:56,221
Ha, ha.

368
00:15:56,221 --> 00:16:00,225
Oh, now, honey, you must admit it's
pretty funny.

369
00:16:00,225 --> 00:16:03,729
Look, I'll admit I'm old enough to be
his... sister...

370
00:16:03,729 --> 00:16:06,231
but his being in love with me isn't
that funny.

371
00:16:06,732 --> 00:16:08,734
You fell in love with me once, you
know.

372
00:16:09,234 --> 00:16:11,737
I sure did, sweetheart.

373
00:16:11,737 --> 00:16:13,739
(phone rings)

374
00:16:13,739 --> 00:16:15,240
Hello.

375
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:18,243
Oh, hello, Peggy.

376
00:16:18,243 --> 00:16:20,245
Oh, Peggy, I don't know what
you're...

377
00:16:20,245 --> 00:16:22,748
Well, Peggy, I didn't mean to...

378
00:16:22,748 --> 00:16:25,250
Oh, well, now, dear, you're jumping
to concl...

379
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:26,251
But, Peggy, I...

380
00:16:26,251 --> 00:16:28,253
Hello, Peggy?

381
00:16:28,253 --> 00:16:31,256
Peggy?

382
00:16:31,256 --> 00:16:33,258
Peggy is coming over.

383
00:16:33,258 --> 00:16:34,259
What for?

384
00:16:34,259 --> 00:16:38,263
She says now that I've taken Arthur
away from her

385
00:16:38,263 --> 00:16:39,264
she ought to get you.

386
00:16:39,264 --> 00:16:41,767
Well, why didn't you tell her not to
come over?

387
00:16:41,767 --> 00:16:43,769
I couldn't get a word in edgewise.

388
00:16:43,769 --> 00:16:44,770
(phone rings)

389
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:47,272
No, no, no, I'll get it this time.

390
00:16:47,272 --> 00:16:48,774
Now, listen here, Peggy...

391
00:16:48,774 --> 00:16:51,777
Oh, hello, Arthur.

392
00:16:51,777 --> 00:16:54,279
Yeah, I know, Arthur.

393
00:16:54,279 --> 00:16:56,782
Well, now, look, after all...

394
00:16:56,782 --> 00:16:58,283
Now, look, Arthur, you can't...

395
00:16:58,283 --> 00:17:00,786
Arthur?

396
00:17:00,786 --> 00:17:03,288
Arthur?

397
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:08,794
Arthur is coming over, too.

398
00:17:08,794 --> 00:17:10,295
Oh, no.

399
00:17:10,295 --> 00:17:11,296
Yeah. He said he wants

400
00:17:11,296 --> 00:17:13,799
to have a man-to-man talk with me
about you.

401
00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:17,803
Oh, swell, here we are in the middle
of a four-sided triangle.

402
00:17:17,803 --> 00:17:19,304
And it's all your fault.

403
00:17:19,304 --> 00:17:20,806
This never would've happened

404
00:17:20,806 --> 00:17:23,809
if you hadn't learned to play that
lousy conga drum.

405
00:17:23,809 --> 00:17:24,810
Never mind that.

406
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:26,812
We got to figure a way to discourage
them.

407
00:17:26,812 --> 00:17:29,314
Well, pointing up that we're too old
for them won't work.

408
00:17:29,314 --> 00:17:30,315
I tried that with Peggy.

409
00:17:30,315 --> 00:17:31,817
Didn't make the slightest impression.

410
00:17:32,317 --> 00:17:36,321
Well, maybe, uh, you didn't make us
old enough.

411
00:17:36,321 --> 00:17:38,323
Hey, you know...

412
00:17:38,323 --> 00:17:40,826
maybe you got something there,
Grandpa.

413
00:17:42,327 --> 00:17:43,328
Yeah. Yeah.

414
00:17:43,328 --> 00:17:44,329
That's what I mean, Grandma.

415
00:17:44,329 --> 00:17:46,465
Hey, come on, we've got a lot of
aging to do.

416
00:17:46,465 --> 00:17:47,966
(chuckling): Okay.

417
00:17:50,969 --> 00:17:51,970
Well...

418
00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:52,971
How is this?

419
00:17:52,971 --> 00:17:54,473
That's pretty good

420
00:17:54,473 --> 00:17:55,974
but you can't talk with such a young
voice.

421
00:17:55,974 --> 00:17:57,476
Oh. Uh...

422
00:17:57,476 --> 00:17:59,978
(older voice): Is this any better?

423
00:17:59,978 --> 00:18:01,480
Yeah, that's better

424
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:03,482
but don't tell me a man your age
still has teeth.

425
00:18:03,482 --> 00:18:05,984
Oh, uh...

426
00:18:05,984 --> 00:18:08,487
Is this all right, Grandma?

427
00:18:08,487 --> 00:18:09,988
Oh, no!

428
00:18:10,489 --> 00:18:13,492
I used to think I'd enjoy growing old
with you

429
00:18:13,492 --> 00:18:16,995
but after this preview, you'd better
grow old alone.

430
00:18:16,995 --> 00:18:17,996
Never mind that.

431
00:18:17,996 --> 00:18:18,997
Listen, how about you?

432
00:18:18,997 --> 00:18:20,499
You don't look very old.

433
00:18:20,499 --> 00:18:22,000
Oh, don't worry about me.

434
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,502
I have a few plans.

435
00:18:23,502 --> 00:18:25,504
(older voice): I may misplace my
teeth, too.

436
00:18:26,004 --> 00:18:28,006
Well, that'll help.

437
00:18:28,006 --> 00:18:29,508
Yeah, kiss me, Grandpa.

438
00:18:29,508 --> 00:18:31,009
All right.

439
00:18:31,009 --> 00:18:32,511
(doorbell buzzes)

440
00:18:32,511 --> 00:18:34,012
Ooh, there's one of them now.

441
00:18:34,012 --> 00:18:35,514
All right.
Get out of sight.

442
00:18:37,516 --> 00:18:40,018
Mrs. Ricardo, this is a terrible
thing

443
00:18:40,018 --> 00:18:41,520
that you've done to me.

444
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,021
I'm disappointed in you.

445
00:18:43,021 --> 00:18:46,024
Oh, well, girlie, I'm so sorry.

446
00:18:46,024 --> 00:18:49,027
Sit down, we'll have a little talk.

447
00:18:49,027 --> 00:18:50,028
What?

448
00:18:50,028 --> 00:18:51,530
Oh, pardon me.

449
00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:54,032
Oh, dear, I always forget those
things.

450
00:18:57,035 --> 00:18:58,537
There, now, sit down.

451
00:18:58,537 --> 00:19:00,539
We'll have a girl-to-girl talk.

452
00:19:00,539 --> 00:19:03,041
Those teeth, aren't they yours?

453
00:19:03,542 --> 00:19:04,543
Well, they sure are.

454
00:19:04,543 --> 00:19:07,045
I made the last payment two months
ago.

455
00:19:08,547 --> 00:19:12,050
Gosh, you're even older than I
thought.

456
00:19:12,050 --> 00:19:13,051
Well!

457
00:19:13,051 --> 00:19:16,054
I can see why you're so afraid of
losing Ricky

458
00:19:16,054 --> 00:19:18,056
but now that you've stolen Arthur

459
00:19:18,056 --> 00:19:19,558
I can't let that make

460
00:19:19,558 --> 00:19:20,559
any difference to me.

461
00:19:21,059 --> 00:19:23,061
Well, I think you're absolutely
right.

462
00:19:23,061 --> 00:19:24,062
You do?

463
00:19:24,062 --> 00:19:26,565
Absolutely, Ricky is yours.

464
00:19:26,565 --> 00:19:29,067
Gee, Mrs. Ricardo, thanks.

465
00:19:29,067 --> 00:19:30,569
Oh, that's all right.

466
00:19:30,569 --> 00:19:31,570
It's really nothing.

467
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:33,071
I'll get him for you.

468
00:19:36,074 --> 00:19:38,577
Oh, Peggy, I-I-I must, uh, warn you.

469
00:19:38,577 --> 00:19:42,080
You know, Ricky isn't as young as you
think he is either.

470
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:44,082
Oh, don't try to scare me, Mrs.
Ricardo.

471
00:19:44,583 --> 00:19:47,085
I've seen him when he comes in for
breakfast.

472
00:19:47,085 --> 00:19:50,088
Oh, well, he's all put together by
then.

473
00:19:52,090 --> 00:19:53,091
"Put together"?

474
00:19:53,592 --> 00:19:56,595
Oh, yeah. You should see him when he
wakes up in the morning.

475
00:19:56,595 --> 00:19:59,097
He's scattered all over the place.

476
00:19:59,598 --> 00:20:00,599
Yeah, well, uh, you see

477
00:20:00,599 --> 00:20:03,602
us show people know a lot of makeup
tricks.

478
00:20:03,602 --> 00:20:05,604
We can look young whenever we want
to.

479
00:20:05,604 --> 00:20:08,106
Oh, you can't frighten me.

480
00:20:08,607 --> 00:20:11,109
Well, all right, Peggy, have it your
way.

481
00:20:11,109 --> 00:20:12,611
I'll turn him over to you.

482
00:20:12,611 --> 00:20:14,613
I'll go get him.

483
00:20:14,613 --> 00:20:16,615
Oh...

484
00:20:16,615 --> 00:20:18,617
Ricky is mine at last.

485
00:20:35,634 --> 00:20:38,637
Ah, hello, Peggy.

486
00:20:38,637 --> 00:20:40,138
Oh, Ricky, you're...

487
00:20:40,138 --> 00:20:42,641
Old man!

488
00:20:42,641 --> 00:20:43,642
Yes, yes.

489
00:20:43,642 --> 00:20:46,645
Isn't that wonderful?

490
00:20:46,645 --> 00:20:49,147
We'll be so happy together.

491
00:20:49,648 --> 00:20:53,151
But... Oh, but this must be some sort
of a joke.

492
00:20:53,151 --> 00:20:55,654
You must be Ricky Ricardo's father.

493
00:20:55,654 --> 00:20:57,189
Oh, no, no, no.

494
00:20:57,189 --> 00:20:59,691
It's me, all right...

495
00:20:59,691 --> 00:21:00,692
(chuckles)

496
00:21:00,692 --> 00:21:05,197
Yeah, the one and only Ricky Ricardo.

497
00:21:05,197 --> 00:21:08,700
That's right, you show them, dear.

498
00:21:09,201 --> 00:21:10,702
All right, Mother.

499
00:21:10,702 --> 00:21:13,205
All right.

500
00:21:13,205 --> 00:21:16,708
(off-key): iBabalu!

501
00:21:20,212 --> 00:21:24,216
iBabalu, aye!

502
00:21:24,216 --> 00:21:25,217
(coughing)

503
00:21:25,217 --> 00:21:28,220
Oh, dear.
Oh, dear.

504
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:30,222
What's the matter?

505
00:21:32,224 --> 00:21:34,226
Wh-What's the matter?

506
00:21:34,226 --> 00:21:36,228
Well, it's his rheumatism.

507
00:21:36,228 --> 00:21:37,229
Rheumatism?

508
00:21:37,229 --> 00:21:38,730
Yeah, he has very...

509
00:21:38,730 --> 00:21:41,733
Put his legs up on the coffee table
there, will you, dear?

510
00:21:41,733 --> 00:21:42,734
That's right.

511
00:21:42,734 --> 00:21:44,736
Be careful, now, when you pull them.

512
00:21:44,736 --> 00:21:45,737
Look out, now.

513
00:21:45,737 --> 00:21:46,738
Watch out.

514
00:21:46,738 --> 00:21:48,240
(moaning)

515
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,242
That's right.

516
00:21:50,242 --> 00:21:51,743
Yeah, now, jiggle them.

517
00:21:51,743 --> 00:21:53,745
"Jiggle them"?

518
00:21:53,745 --> 00:21:56,748
Yeah, you have to keep them moving

519
00:21:56,748 --> 00:21:58,750
or his arteries harden.

520
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:00,252
Go ahead, jiggle them.

521
00:22:00,252 --> 00:22:01,753
I'll fill this up, dear.

522
00:22:01,753 --> 00:22:03,255
Thank you.

523
00:22:03,255 --> 00:22:04,756
(sighing)

524
00:22:04,756 --> 00:22:10,262
Oh, dear, I-I don't understand this
whole thing.

525
00:22:10,262 --> 00:22:13,265
Your hair, Ricky, when did it get
white?

526
00:22:13,265 --> 00:22:15,267
Oh, oh, that's right.

527
00:22:15,267 --> 00:22:19,271
You never saw my hair this way, did
you?

528
00:22:19,271 --> 00:22:20,272
No.

529
00:22:20,272 --> 00:22:24,276
Well, you see, I don't bother with
the shoeblack at home.

530
00:22:27,279 --> 00:22:30,282
Keep jiggling, Peggy.
Please, keep jiggling.

531
00:22:34,286 --> 00:22:35,787
Is that better?

532
00:22:35,787 --> 00:22:37,289
Yes, that's better.

533
00:22:37,289 --> 00:22:42,794
You know, you're a much better
jiggler than Lucy.

534
00:22:42,794 --> 00:22:44,796
Yeah.

535
00:22:44,796 --> 00:22:46,298
Thanks.

536
00:22:46,298 --> 00:22:47,299
Okay. All right.

537
00:22:47,299 --> 00:22:50,802
I can't believe this whole thing.

538
00:22:50,802 --> 00:22:53,805
Why, I just saw you at rehearsal
yesterday

539
00:22:53,805 --> 00:22:57,309
dancing around and beating your conga
drum.

540
00:22:57,309 --> 00:22:58,810
Oh, yes.

541
00:22:58,810 --> 00:23:02,314
Well... I'm glad you saw that, yes.

542
00:23:02,314 --> 00:23:05,317
That was my farewell performance.

543
00:23:05,317 --> 00:23:08,820
Yeah, he's baba'd his last loo.

544
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:10,322
(doorbell buzzes)

545
00:23:10,322 --> 00:23:11,323
Thank you.
Thank you.

546
00:23:11,323 --> 00:23:12,324
Oh, I'll get it.

547
00:23:12,324 --> 00:23:13,825
Keep jiggling.

548
00:23:13,825 --> 00:23:15,827
Yeah, keep jiggling, please.

549
00:23:17,829 --> 00:23:19,331
Where's Mr. Ricardo?

550
00:23:19,331 --> 00:23:20,832
Look, Mr. Ricardo

551
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:22,834
let's be adult about this.

552
00:23:22,834 --> 00:23:23,835
I...

553
00:23:25,337 --> 00:23:28,840
Ay!

554
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:30,842
What happened to him?

555
00:23:30,842 --> 00:23:31,843
He's old.

556
00:23:31,843 --> 00:23:33,845
This is the first time we've seen him

557
00:23:33,845 --> 00:23:35,847
without shoeblack on his hair.

558
00:23:35,847 --> 00:23:38,350
Oh. Well, look, Mr. Ricardo...

559
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:42,354
Oh, Arthur, not another word.

560
00:23:42,354 --> 00:23:43,855
I'm happy.

561
00:23:43,855 --> 00:23:45,357
I have Peggy.

562
00:23:45,357 --> 00:23:47,359
Yeah.

563
00:23:47,359 --> 00:23:50,362
Keep jiggling, Peggy.
Please, keep jiggling.

564
00:23:53,365 --> 00:23:54,866
Go to Lucy, Arthur.

565
00:23:54,866 --> 00:23:56,368
She's all yours.

566
00:23:58,370 --> 00:24:00,872
Uh, we'll be very happy together,
Arthur.

567
00:24:00,872 --> 00:24:03,375
Of course, I'll miss the old
gentleman.

568
00:24:03,375 --> 00:24:04,876
He's the only one that knew

569
00:24:04,876 --> 00:24:06,878
how to put the batteries in my
hearing aid.

570
00:24:09,381 --> 00:24:11,383
Your hearing aid?

571
00:24:11,383 --> 00:24:13,385
Yes. You don't mind, do you?

572
00:24:13,885 --> 00:24:15,387
Oh, no, no.

573
00:24:15,387 --> 00:24:16,888
I still love you.

574
00:24:16,888 --> 00:24:18,390
How's that?

575
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:20,892
I said, I still love you.

576
00:24:20,892 --> 00:24:22,894
Oh, yes, sir, it sure does.

577
00:24:22,894 --> 00:24:24,396
No!

578
00:24:24,396 --> 00:24:27,399
I said, I still love you!

579
00:24:27,399 --> 00:24:29,401
Oh, no. Oh, no, thanks.

580
00:24:29,401 --> 00:24:31,903
Never touch the stuff.

581
00:24:31,903 --> 00:24:35,407
Peggy, please, keep jiggling, please.

582
00:24:37,909 --> 00:24:40,912
I never knew you wore glasses.

583
00:24:40,912 --> 00:24:41,913
How's that?

584
00:24:41,913 --> 00:24:43,915
The glasses!

585
00:24:43,915 --> 00:24:46,418
I said, I never knew you wore
glasses!

586
00:24:46,418 --> 00:24:48,420
Oh, well, I don't really need them.

587
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:50,922
I can see just as well without them.

588
00:24:50,922 --> 00:24:53,425
Hello, Arthur?

589
00:24:53,425 --> 00:24:55,427
Arthur?

590
00:24:55,427 --> 00:24:56,928
Where'd he go?

591
00:24:56,928 --> 00:24:58,430
Oh!

592
00:24:58,430 --> 00:24:59,931
Oh, there you are.

593
00:24:59,931 --> 00:25:01,433
Gee, Arthur...

594
00:25:01,433 --> 00:25:03,935
th-they're both falling apart.

595
00:25:03,935 --> 00:25:07,439
Well, Mrs. Ricardo doesn't look so
old.

596
00:25:07,439 --> 00:25:11,443
She's kind of...
well preserved.

597
00:25:11,443 --> 00:25:13,445
At least her hair isn't white.

598
00:25:13,445 --> 00:25:15,947
Oh, sonny, do you like my hair?

599
00:25:15,947 --> 00:25:16,948
Yeah.

600
00:25:17,449 --> 00:25:18,950
Well, here, you can have it.

601
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:20,452
(both screaming)

602
00:25:26,458 --> 00:25:29,961

00:00:30,697 --> 00:00:35,085
I want a girl

5
00:00:35,085 --> 00:00:40,090
Just like the girl

6
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:50,100
That married dear, old Dad

7
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:54,104

00:00:55,605 --> 00:00:57,607
Oh, that was wonderful!

10
00:00:57,607 --> 00:00:59,109
We're great.

11
00:00:59,109 --> 00:01:00,610
Yeah, you even sounded good.

12
00:01:00,610 --> 00:01:02,112
Thank you.

13
00:01:02,112 --> 00:01:04,114
You know, a little more practice and
we could do

14
00:01:04,114 --> 00:01:05,615
singing commercials for television.

15
00:01:05,615 --> 00:01:09,619
Gee, Ethel, you certainly play the
piano wonderfully.

16
00:01:09,619 --> 00:01:10,620
Oh, thanks, Lucy.

17
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:12,122
Hey, how about "Sweet Sue"?

18
00:01:12,122 --> 00:01:14,124
Yeah, that has a nice harmony, all
right?

19
00:01:14,124 --> 00:01:15,625
Da-da da-da-da-da...

20
00:01:15,625 --> 00:01:16,626
Oh, wait a minute, Ethel.

21
00:01:16,626 --> 00:01:18,628
It's, uh, it's 2:00 in the morning.

22
00:01:18,628 --> 00:01:20,130
Well, what about it, honey?

23
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:23,133
Yeah, yeah, 2:00's the perfect time
for "Sweet Sue."

24
00:01:23,133 --> 00:01:25,135
Yeah.
Well, I mean, it's a little late.

25
00:01:25,135 --> 00:01:27,137
Won't the other tenants complain?

26
00:01:27,137 --> 00:01:28,138
About what, honey?
About what?

27
00:01:28,138 --> 00:01:29,639
About all the noise.

28
00:01:29,639 --> 00:01:30,640
Noise?
Noise?
Noise?

29
00:01:31,141 --> 00:01:34,144
Huh, we're not making noise; we're
making music.

30
00:01:34,144 --> 00:01:35,645
Yeah. Let them phone the landlord.

31
00:01:35,645 --> 00:01:36,646
I'm not home.

32
00:01:36,646 --> 00:01:38,148
(laughing)

33
00:01:38,148 --> 00:01:40,650
I always forget that you're the
landlord.

34
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:42,152
RICKY: Yeah, come on.

35
00:01:42,152 --> 00:01:45,155
Besides, what's wrong with good
friends harmonizing a little?

36
00:01:45,155 --> 00:01:46,656
That's what the world needs more of.

37
00:01:46,656 --> 00:01:48,158
You're right.

38
00:01:48,158 --> 00:01:51,161
Oh, it's so wonderful to have
landlords like you two.

39
00:01:51,161 --> 00:01:53,663
What a break for us to have tenants
like you two.

40
00:01:53,663 --> 00:01:55,665
Well, okay, okay, "Sweet Sue." Yeah.

41
00:01:55,665 --> 00:01:57,167
Da-da da-da-da-da...

42
00:01:57,167 --> 00:01:58,168
Look at this place, Lucy.

43
00:01:58,168 --> 00:01:59,669
You've taken such good care of it

44
00:01:59,669 --> 00:02:02,672
we could rent it tomorrow and not
have to change a thing.

45
00:02:02,672 --> 00:02:04,674
Yeah.
Okay, okay, "Sweet Sue."

46
00:02:04,674 --> 00:02:06,176
Da-da da-da-da-da...

47
00:02:06,176 --> 00:02:07,177
Well, you know why, Ethel?

48
00:02:07,177 --> 00:02:09,679
It was in such wonderful condition
when we moved in.

49
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:11,181
Well, all right, all right, girls.

50
00:02:11,181 --> 00:02:12,182
Now, "Sweet Sue."

51
00:02:12,182 --> 00:02:13,183
Da-da da-da da-da...

52
00:02:13,683 --> 00:02:16,186
You're the nicest tenant I ever had.

53
00:02:16,686 --> 00:02:17,687
And you're certainly

54
00:02:17,687 --> 00:02:20,190
the nicest landlady I've ever had.

55
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:23,193
And this is the most sickening
conversation

56
00:02:23,193 --> 00:02:24,194
I've ever heard.

57
00:02:24,194 --> 00:02:25,195
You're so right.

58
00:02:25,195 --> 00:02:26,696
Oh...
Oh, you two have no sentiment.

59
00:02:27,197 --> 00:02:28,698
I move that we dedicate the next
number

60
00:02:28,698 --> 00:02:29,699
to our wonderful friendship.

61
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,202
All right, to our friendship.
I subscribe to that.

62
00:02:32,202 --> 00:02:34,204
That's a wonderful idea.
To Ricky and Lucy.

63
00:02:34,204 --> 00:02:35,205
Here we go.

64
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:38,208
Ah, now then.
All right?

65
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:39,209
"Sweet Sue"-- ready, go.

66
00:02:39,209 --> 00:02:40,210
"Sweet Sue." Good, wasn't it?

67
00:02:40,210 --> 00:02:41,711
Da-da da-da-da-da

68
00:02:41,711 --> 00:02:44,214
Every star above

69
00:02:44,214 --> 00:02:46,716
Knows the one I love

70
00:02:46,716 --> 00:02:51,221
Sweet Sue, just you

71
00:02:51,221 --> 00:02:53,723
And the moon up high

72
00:02:53,723 --> 00:02:56,226
Knows the reason why

73
00:02:56,226 --> 00:03:00,730
Sweet Sue, yes, you

74
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:05,735
No one else, it seems, ever shared my
dreams

75
00:03:06,236 --> 00:03:09,739
And without you, dear, I don't know
what I'd do

76
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:14,744
In this heart of mine you live all
the time

77
00:03:15,245 --> 00:03:18,748
Sweet Sue, that's you

78
00:03:18,748 --> 00:03:23,253
(solo): Nobody but you.

79
00:03:23,253 --> 00:03:25,255
Oh, that's all.
It's getting late.
We got to go.

80
00:03:25,255 --> 00:03:26,756
Yeah, we got to get out of here.

81
00:03:26,756 --> 00:03:28,258
You got to go?
Oh, no, Ethel.

82
00:03:28,258 --> 00:03:30,260
Thanks for everything, now.
Oh, honey, no.

83
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:32,262
Oh, that's too bad.
Thanks for everything, Rick.

84
00:03:32,262 --> 00:03:34,764
Well, I'm glad you came up, Fred.
We've enjoyed it.

85
00:03:34,764 --> 00:03:35,765
See you in the morning.

86
00:03:35,765 --> 00:03:37,767
Good-bye, Ethel.
You cut that out.

87
00:03:37,767 --> 00:03:39,269
Good night.
Good night.

88
00:03:39,269 --> 00:03:40,270
Good night.

89
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:42,272
Oh...

90
00:03:42,272 --> 00:03:44,774
Gee...

91
00:03:44,774 --> 00:03:45,775
(sighs)

92
00:03:45,775 --> 00:03:47,777
Aren't they wonderful people?

93
00:03:47,777 --> 00:03:49,779
Yeah, they sure are a lot of fun,
honey.

94
00:03:49,779 --> 00:03:52,282
Oh, I had such a good time tonight.

95
00:03:52,282 --> 00:03:55,285
I want to live in this apartment the
rest of my life.

96
00:03:55,285 --> 00:03:58,788
Well, honey, I think that you and I
and Fred and Ethel

97
00:03:58,788 --> 00:04:00,790
are fated to go through life
together.

98
00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:02,292
Yep.
Hey, look.

99
00:04:02,292 --> 00:04:03,793
Ethel left her rings here.

100
00:04:03,793 --> 00:04:05,795
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.

101
00:04:05,795 --> 00:04:07,797
You know, honey, she's absolutely
right.

102
00:04:07,797 --> 00:04:10,300
People ought to do more singing in
this world.

103
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:11,301
That's right, honey.

104
00:04:11,301 --> 00:04:12,802
(chuckles)

105
00:04:12,802 --> 00:04:16,806
Yes, sir, they sure should sing--
everybody.

106
00:04:16,806 --> 00:04:17,807
"Sweet Sue."

107
00:04:17,807 --> 00:04:19,309
(playing bouncy intro)

108
00:04:19,309 --> 00:04:24,314
Every star above knows the one I love

109
00:04:24,314 --> 00:04:28,818
BOTH: Sweet Sue, just you

110
00:04:28,818 --> 00:04:33,323
And the moon up high knows the reason
why

111
00:04:33,323 --> 00:04:37,827
Sweet Sue, yes, you

112
00:04:37,827 --> 00:04:42,332
No one else, it seems, ever shared my
dreams

113
00:04:42,332 --> 00:04:45,335
And without you, dear, I don't know
what I'd do.

114
00:04:45,335 --> 00:04:47,837
Ya-da-bum, ba-de-dum, ba-de-dum,
bum-bum.

115
00:04:47,837 --> 00:04:48,838
(thumping)

116
00:04:48,838 --> 00:04:50,340
What was that?

117
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:51,341
I don't know.

118
00:04:51,341 --> 00:04:52,842
Come on, let's go.

119
00:04:52,842 --> 00:04:56,346
In this heart of mine, you l...

120
00:04:56,346 --> 00:04:58,848
(thumping)

121
00:04:58,848 --> 00:05:01,851
That sounded like it came from the
Mertz apartment.

122
00:05:01,851 --> 00:05:03,853
Oh, no, honey, it couldn't be.

123
00:05:03,853 --> 00:05:04,854
No, I guess not.

124
00:05:04,854 --> 00:05:07,357
You live all the...

125
00:05:07,357 --> 00:05:09,359
(thump)

126
00:05:09,359 --> 00:05:10,360
Time.

127
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,861
(thump, thump)

128
00:05:11,861 --> 00:05:13,363
Sweet Sue, it's you.

129
00:05:13,363 --> 00:05:14,364
(thump)

130
00:05:14,364 --> 00:05:16,366
(phone rings)

131
00:05:16,366 --> 00:05:17,367
Hello?

132
00:05:17,367 --> 00:05:18,868
ETHEL: Hello, Lucy?

133
00:05:18,868 --> 00:05:20,870
Hi, Ethel, what's you...
what's on your mind?

134
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:22,872
What's going on up there, anyway?

135
00:05:22,872 --> 00:05:24,374
Oh, we're singing "Sweet Sue."

136
00:05:24,374 --> 00:05:25,875
Want to come up for another chorus?

137
00:05:25,875 --> 00:05:27,877
Do you know what time it is?

138
00:05:27,877 --> 00:05:30,380
How do you expect anybody to get to
sleep?

139
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:31,881
Why, Ethel, what's the matter?

140
00:05:31,881 --> 00:05:34,384
You thought it was fine when you were
up here.

141
00:05:34,384 --> 00:05:37,887
Well, I'm down here now and I think
it's lousy.

142
00:05:39,906 --> 00:05:40,907
Well, really, Ethel!

143
00:05:40,907 --> 00:05:43,910
How can you change in such a short
time?

144
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:45,912
Good night, Lucy.

145
00:05:45,912 --> 00:05:47,413
Good night.

146
00:05:49,415 --> 00:05:50,917
What's the matter with Ethel?

147
00:05:50,917 --> 00:05:55,922
She must've walked downstairs too
fast and gotten the bends.

148
00:05:55,922 --> 00:05:56,923
What?

149
00:05:56,923 --> 00:05:59,425
Well, she's a little grumpy because
we're making noise.

150
00:05:59,425 --> 00:06:00,927
Well, I thought she...
Well, so did I.

151
00:06:01,427 --> 00:06:02,428
She'll be over it in the morning.

152
00:06:02,428 --> 00:06:04,430
All right.
Come on, honey, let's go to bed.

153
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:07,867
Da-da da-da-da, da-da, da-da-da...

154
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:11,371
94, 95, 96...

155
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:15,875
97, 98, 99, 100.

156
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:19,379
(sighs)

157
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:23,883
(bangs)

158
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:40,900
(bangs)

159
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:44,404
Oh, no, you don't.

160
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:48,408
(bangs)

161
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:54,914
(bangs)

162
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:00,920
(bangs)

163
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,422
Now, Ricky...

164
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:04,924
All right, all right, we'll
compromise.

165
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:17,437
That's a compromise?

166
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:18,438
(bangs)

167
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:19,439
(rattling)

168
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:21,441
Now, what do you want me to do,
freeze to death?

169
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:24,444
(phone rings)
A little fresh air isn't going to
hurt you

170
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:25,445
you hothouse plant.

171
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:26,946
(ringing continues)

172
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:27,947
Hello?

173
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:30,450
FRED: Will you cut out that racket up
there?

174
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:31,451
Fred?

175
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:32,452
Yes, Fred!

176
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:34,954
How do you expect people to get any
sleep?

177
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:36,956
Well, I was only closing the windows.

178
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:39,959
What with? A sledgehammer?

179
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:41,461
Now listen, Fred...

180
00:07:41,961 --> 00:07:43,463
Listen, my foot.

181
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:45,965
Now, let's have it quiet up there!

182
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:51,471
Huh, how do you like that?

183
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:55,475
"Let's have it quiet up there!" he
says.

184
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:58,478
Some lousy landlords they are.

185
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,481
Yeah.

186
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:03,483
Nerts to the Mertz.

187
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:05,985
Yeah.

188
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:07,987
Well...
good night, baby.

189
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:09,489
Good night, honey.

190
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:13,993
(water dripping)

191
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:21,000
(dripping continues)

192
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:33,012
(dripping continues)

193
00:08:40,469 --> 00:08:41,971
Oh, no.

194
00:08:46,976 --> 00:08:48,978
The shower is dripping.

195
00:08:48,978 --> 00:08:50,980
Yep, sure is.

196
00:08:54,483 --> 00:08:57,987
Somebody should get up and fix it.

197
00:08:57,987 --> 00:08:59,989
Yep, somebody should.

198
00:09:01,991 --> 00:09:03,492
Well?

199
00:09:03,492 --> 00:09:05,995
Well?

200
00:09:05,995 --> 00:09:08,497
This isn't getting us anyplace.

201
00:09:08,497 --> 00:09:10,499
We'll both get up and fix it.

202
00:09:10,499 --> 00:09:11,500
What?

203
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:13,002
That's the only fair way.

204
00:09:13,002 --> 00:09:15,504
When I count to three, we'll both
jump out of bed.

205
00:09:15,504 --> 00:09:16,505
All right.

206
00:09:16,505 --> 00:09:17,506
You ready?
Ready.

207
00:09:17,506 --> 00:09:18,507
Okay.

208
00:09:18,507 --> 00:09:20,509
One...

209
00:09:20,509 --> 00:09:21,510
two...

210
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:23,012
three!

211
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:35,024
Apparently, we can't trust either of
us.

212
00:09:35,024 --> 00:09:36,025
Apparently.

213
00:09:36,025 --> 00:09:38,961
Well, as far as I'm concerned, that
shower can drip all night.

214
00:09:38,961 --> 00:09:39,962
I just don't care.

215
00:09:39,962 --> 00:09:41,464
I won't pay any attention to it.

216
00:09:41,464 --> 00:09:42,465
All right, neither will I.

217
00:09:42,465 --> 00:09:43,966
All right.
All right.

218
00:09:43,966 --> 00:09:46,469
(dripping continues)

219
00:09:53,976 --> 00:09:56,979
(dripping continues)

220
00:10:09,992 --> 00:10:12,995
(dripping volume increasing)

221
00:10:28,511 --> 00:10:30,513
I can't stand it anymore!

222
00:10:31,013 --> 00:10:33,516
I can't stand it, I tell you!

223
00:10:33,516 --> 00:10:35,017
I can't stand it!

224
00:10:35,017 --> 00:10:36,519
I can't stand it anymore!

225
00:10:36,519 --> 00:10:37,520
I can't stand it!

226
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:41,023
(banging and shouting)

227
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:42,525
What are you doing?

228
00:10:42,525 --> 00:10:44,527
I can't lock it up!
I can't lock it!

229
00:10:44,527 --> 00:10:46,529
I'm going to use the wrench.

230
00:10:46,529 --> 00:10:48,030
(phone rings)
Oh...

231
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:50,533
(banging continuing)

232
00:10:54,537 --> 00:10:55,538
Hello?

233
00:10:55,538 --> 00:10:57,540
What's going on up there now?!

234
00:10:57,540 --> 00:11:00,543
Ricky's trying to fix some of your
antique plumbing!

235
00:11:00,543 --> 00:11:01,544
That's what's going on!

236
00:11:01,544 --> 00:11:03,045
Oh, no.

237
00:11:03,045 --> 00:11:04,547
Let me talk to him!

238
00:11:04,547 --> 00:11:06,048
All right!

239
00:11:06,048 --> 00:11:07,550
Fred wants to talk to you!

240
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:09,552
Just a minute!

241
00:11:09,552 --> 00:11:11,053
Just a minute!

242
00:11:11,053 --> 00:11:14,056
(banging continues)

243
00:11:14,056 --> 00:11:17,059
(water rushing)

244
00:11:17,059 --> 00:11:18,060
(Ricky shouting)

245
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:19,562
Oh, Ricky!

246
00:11:19,562 --> 00:11:21,063
Ricky, what happened?!

247
00:11:21,063 --> 00:11:23,065
What happened?!
What happened?!

248
00:11:23,065 --> 00:11:24,066
Oh...

249
00:11:26,068 --> 00:11:27,069
Oh...

250
00:11:27,069 --> 00:11:29,071
The pipe broke, that's what happened!

251
00:11:29,071 --> 00:11:31,073
Oh, honey, you're all wet.

252
00:11:31,073 --> 00:11:33,075
Give me that phone! Hello!

253
00:11:33,075 --> 00:11:36,579
Listen, lunkhead, stop pounding on
those pipes!

254
00:11:36,579 --> 00:11:38,080
Listen, you old poop

255
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:40,583
why don't you put some decent
plumbing in this firetrap?!

256
00:11:40,583 --> 00:11:43,586
We will, as soon as we get some
decent tenants!

257
00:11:44,086 --> 00:11:46,589
Yeah? Well, maybe you'd like us to
move.

258
00:11:46,589 --> 00:11:48,090
That'd suit me fine.

259
00:11:48,090 --> 00:11:49,091
All right, all right!

260
00:11:49,091 --> 00:11:50,593
That settles it-- we're moving!

261
00:11:50,593 --> 00:11:52,595
Good-bye and good riddance!

262
00:11:52,595 --> 00:11:53,596
Good-bye!

263
00:11:53,596 --> 00:11:54,597
We're moving!

264
00:11:54,597 --> 00:11:55,598
Good!

265
00:11:55,598 --> 00:11:56,599
They're moving.

266
00:11:56,599 --> 00:11:57,600
Good!

267
00:11:59,101 --> 00:12:01,604
I wouldn't stay in this crummy
apartment

268
00:12:02,104 --> 00:12:04,607
with those horrible Mertzes if you
paid me.

269
00:12:04,607 --> 00:12:06,108
FRED: Hello!

270
00:12:06,108 --> 00:12:08,611
Hello. I'd like to speak to Mrs.
Mertz.

271
00:12:11,113 --> 00:12:12,114
Hello.

272
00:12:12,114 --> 00:12:15,117
Whoever told you you could play the
piano?!

273
00:12:22,074 --> 00:12:24,043
(door buzzer)

274
00:12:27,546 --> 00:12:29,048
Good morning.

275
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:43,062
I hate to bother you, Mrs. Ricardo

276
00:12:43,062 --> 00:12:45,564
but I believe I left my diamond rings

277
00:12:45,564 --> 00:12:47,066
on your piano last night.

278
00:12:47,066 --> 00:12:48,567
Yes, you did, Mrs. Mertz.

279
00:12:48,567 --> 00:12:51,070
I'd be very happy to get them for
you.

280
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:52,071
Oh, don't bother.

281
00:12:52,071 --> 00:12:53,572
I'll get them...

282
00:12:53,572 --> 00:12:55,074
if they're still there.

283
00:12:57,576 --> 00:12:59,578
I don't know why you should worry.

284
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:03,082
You can always buy another box of
Cracker Jack.

285
00:13:06,585 --> 00:13:09,588
I'll have you know these are real
diamonds.

286
00:13:09,588 --> 00:13:10,589
Ha!

287
00:13:13,092 --> 00:13:16,095
Mrs. Ricardo, would you be so kind as
to inform me

288
00:13:16,095 --> 00:13:19,598
just when we are to be deprived of
your charming company?

289
00:13:19,598 --> 00:13:20,599
Very shortly.

290
00:13:20,599 --> 00:13:22,101
Good.

291
00:13:22,101 --> 00:13:23,102
Thank you.

292
00:13:23,102 --> 00:13:24,603
My, it'll certainly be nice

293
00:13:24,603 --> 00:13:27,106
getting away from such disagreeable
people.

294
00:13:27,106 --> 00:13:29,108
It certainly will.

295
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:33,612
Would you like to give me the check

296
00:13:33,612 --> 00:13:35,614
for the next five months' rent now?

297
00:13:36,115 --> 00:13:37,616
Of course, I'd be delighted.

298
00:13:37,616 --> 00:13:40,119
What do you mean "the next five
months' rent"?

299
00:13:40,119 --> 00:13:41,120
Well, if you're leaving

300
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:43,122
you have to pay off your lease.

301
00:13:43,122 --> 00:13:44,123
Our lease?!

302
00:13:44,123 --> 00:13:45,624
Yes, don't you remember?

303
00:13:45,624 --> 00:13:48,627
You begged me on bended knee to give
you a lease

304
00:13:48,627 --> 00:13:51,130
just so that no one else could have

305
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:54,133
this fantastically inexpensive,
lovely apartment.

306
00:13:54,133 --> 00:13:57,636
Oh, you mean that one-sided, unfair,
binding contract

307
00:13:57,636 --> 00:13:59,138
that we were forced to sign

308
00:13:59,138 --> 00:14:01,640
before you would grant us the
privilege

309
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:03,642
of moving into this broken-down
hovel?

310
00:14:04,143 --> 00:14:05,644
"Broken-down" is right.

311
00:14:05,644 --> 00:14:07,146
Look at this place.

312
00:14:07,146 --> 00:14:10,649
It'll take the next five months' rent
to redecorate.

313
00:14:10,649 --> 00:14:12,151
Redecorate?

314
00:14:12,151 --> 00:14:13,652
Yes.

315
00:14:13,652 --> 00:14:16,155
After we fumigate.

316
00:14:19,658 --> 00:14:22,661
You can leave the check in my
mailbox.

317
00:14:22,661 --> 00:14:23,662
(door slams)

318
00:14:23,662 --> 00:14:24,663
I...

319
00:14:24,663 --> 00:14:25,664
Ooh!

320
00:14:26,165 --> 00:14:27,666
Honey, I don't seem to be able to...

321
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:29,668
Oh, shut up!

322
00:14:29,668 --> 00:14:31,170
What's the matter with you?

323
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:32,171
Oh, I'm sorry.

324
00:14:32,671 --> 00:14:34,673
Ethel was just up here and she made
me so darn mad!

325
00:14:34,673 --> 00:14:36,175
What now?

326
00:14:36,675 --> 00:14:39,178
She says she...
they're going to hold us to our
lease.

327
00:14:39,178 --> 00:14:41,180
We have to give them five months'
rent

328
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:42,181
before we can leave!

329
00:14:42,181 --> 00:14:43,682
I guess we're stuck here.

330
00:14:43,682 --> 00:14:48,187
Well, now that, uh...
that all depends.

331
00:14:48,187 --> 00:14:49,688
On what?

332
00:14:49,688 --> 00:14:52,191
On whether we can, uh, break the
lease or not.

333
00:14:52,191 --> 00:14:54,193
Do you think we can?

334
00:14:54,193 --> 00:14:56,695
Mm... could be.

335
00:14:56,695 --> 00:14:58,697
What's on your mind?

336
00:14:58,697 --> 00:15:03,702
We are going to become the two most
unpleasant, disagreeable

337
00:15:03,702 --> 00:15:06,205
nasty people in the whole world.

338
00:15:06,705 --> 00:15:08,207
But how?

339
00:15:08,207 --> 00:15:10,709
We'll force ourselves.

340
00:15:10,709 --> 00:15:11,710
Oh, boy.

341
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:13,212
Let's see, now.

342
00:15:13,212 --> 00:15:15,714
What can we think of that'll make
them kick us out?

343
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:22,721
Nah...

344
00:15:22,721 --> 00:15:23,722
Think nastier.

345
00:15:23,722 --> 00:15:25,224
We'll get it.

346
00:15:56,055 --> 00:15:57,056
Hiya, honey.

347
00:15:57,056 --> 00:15:58,557
Hi!

348
00:15:59,058 --> 00:16:01,560
How's my little lease-breaker doing?

349
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:03,562
Just fine.

350
00:16:03,562 --> 00:16:05,064
Ha, ha! That's good.

351
00:16:05,064 --> 00:16:07,066
How'd things go at rehearsal?

352
00:16:07,066 --> 00:16:09,068
Oh, pretty good, honey.

353
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:12,571
(door slams)

354
00:16:14,573 --> 00:16:15,574
Look.

355
00:16:15,574 --> 00:16:17,076
(whirs)

356
00:16:17,076 --> 00:16:18,077
What's that?

357
00:16:18,077 --> 00:16:20,579
A riveter's hammer. Watch.

358
00:16:20,579 --> 00:16:24,083
(clattering loudly)

359
00:16:28,587 --> 00:16:30,589
(laughing)

360
00:16:30,589 --> 00:16:32,091
Hey, that's very good.

361
00:16:32,091 --> 00:16:33,092
That's very good.

362
00:16:33,092 --> 00:16:35,594
I'm surprised they haven't moved out.

363
00:16:35,594 --> 00:16:37,096
Yeah?
I have quite a schedule.

364
00:16:37,096 --> 00:16:39,598
Oh, it's time to make another call to
Ethel.

365
00:16:39,598 --> 00:16:41,100
Let me, let me, let me do this.

366
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:42,601
(whirring loudly)

367
00:16:42,601 --> 00:16:46,105
(clattering loudly)

368
00:16:46,105 --> 00:16:48,107
(hammer bit falls out)

369
00:16:48,107 --> 00:16:49,608
Hey!
What happened?

370
00:16:49,608 --> 00:16:51,110
Shh-- get this.
Yeah?

371
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:53,612
Hello, this is the Ajax Salvage
Company.

372
00:16:53,612 --> 00:16:55,114
We buy old glass.

373
00:16:55,114 --> 00:16:57,116
I understand you have some rings

374
00:16:57,116 --> 00:16:59,618
that you're interested in selling.

375
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,621
(whirring loudly)

376
00:17:07,126 --> 00:17:09,128
Oh, she's furious!

377
00:17:09,128 --> 00:17:10,629
Oh, am I glad I'm on your side!

378
00:17:10,629 --> 00:17:12,631
(both laughing)

379
00:17:12,631 --> 00:17:14,133
We'll break that lease yet.

380
00:17:14,133 --> 00:17:16,135
Now, remember, when you come home
tonight

381
00:17:16,135 --> 00:17:17,136
make a lot of noise.

382
00:17:17,136 --> 00:17:18,137
Oh, that reminds me.

383
00:17:18,137 --> 00:17:20,139
I won't be home till late tonight,
honey.

384
00:17:20,139 --> 00:17:21,140
Why?
Well, we have to rehearse

385
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:23,142
for a couple of hours after the club
closes.

386
00:17:23,142 --> 00:17:26,145
Ricky, why don't you have the
rehearsal here?

387
00:17:26,145 --> 00:17:27,646
Honey, are you crazy?

388
00:17:27,646 --> 00:17:28,647
I got a 16-piece band.

389
00:17:28,647 --> 00:17:30,649
I'll blow the roof off the joint.

390
00:17:30,649 --> 00:17:33,152
Well... doesn't look like rain.

391
00:17:35,154 --> 00:17:36,155
I'll do it.

392
00:17:36,155 --> 00:17:37,156
(laughs)

393
00:17:37,156 --> 00:17:38,157
I'll do it.

394
00:17:38,157 --> 00:17:39,158
Good.

395
00:17:43,829 --> 00:17:45,330
(playing loud, jazzy Latin number)

396
00:17:45,831 --> 00:17:46,832
Yeah! Yeah!

397
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:50,335
Yeah!
Yeah! Yeah!

398
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:52,337
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

399
00:18:01,346 --> 00:18:03,348
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

400
00:18:06,852 --> 00:18:09,855
(singing in Spanish)

401
00:18:17,863 --> 00:18:19,865
A cumba, cumba, cumba cumbachero

402
00:18:19,865 --> 00:18:21,366
iChero!

403
00:18:21,366 --> 00:18:22,868
A bongo, bongo, bongo, bongosero

404
00:18:22,868 --> 00:18:23,869
iBongosero!

405
00:18:23,869 --> 00:18:26,371
(continues singing in Spanish)

406
00:18:26,371 --> 00:18:28,373
...Bongosero que se va.

407
00:18:28,373 --> 00:18:36,381
iBongosero que se va!

408
00:18:36,381 --> 00:18:40,886
(cheering and applauding)

409
00:18:44,389 --> 00:18:45,891
Oh, that was wonderful!

410
00:18:45,891 --> 00:18:48,894
That's the best number you've done
since midnight.

411
00:18:48,894 --> 00:18:49,895
(laughing)

412
00:18:49,895 --> 00:18:51,396
What time is it?

413
00:18:51,396 --> 00:18:53,398
Uh, 4:30.

414
00:18:53,398 --> 00:18:55,400
All right, now let's have a loud one.

415
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:58,403
A loud one?
Yeah.

416
00:18:58,403 --> 00:18:59,905
All right.

417
00:18:59,905 --> 00:19:02,407
Listen, I wonder how Fred and Ethel
are enjoying it.

418
00:19:02,407 --> 00:19:03,909
Well, they have a lot of courage.

419
00:19:03,909 --> 00:19:05,911
I haven't heard a peep out of them.

420
00:19:05,911 --> 00:19:08,413
Oh, boy, this is swell.

421
00:19:08,413 --> 00:19:09,915
No, isn't it?

422
00:19:09,915 --> 00:19:11,917
Honey, who are all these people?

423
00:19:11,917 --> 00:19:13,418
I don't know, but the more, the
noisier.

424
00:19:13,418 --> 00:19:14,920
Yeah?

425
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:17,422
All right, we'll dedicate the next
number

426
00:19:17,422 --> 00:19:18,924
to Fred and Ethel Mertz.

427
00:19:18,924 --> 00:19:20,425
Great!
All right.
Fred and Ethel Mertz?

428
00:19:20,425 --> 00:19:21,927
Yes, our lovely landlords.

429
00:19:22,427 --> 00:19:22,928
They won't hear this.

430
00:19:23,428 --> 00:19:24,429
They're still down in the street.

431
00:19:24,429 --> 00:19:25,430
Down in the street?

432
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:26,932
Yes, they have a big sign

433
00:19:26,932 --> 00:19:29,434
that says, "Jam Session Tonight:
Ricky Ricardo in Person"

434
00:19:29,434 --> 00:19:30,936
and they're selling tickets.

435
00:19:30,936 --> 00:19:33,438
Oh, no!

436
00:19:33,438 --> 00:19:34,439
Oh!

437
00:19:34,439 --> 00:19:35,941
RICKY: How do you like that?

438
00:19:35,941 --> 00:19:36,942
I'm going down there

439
00:19:36,942 --> 00:19:38,944
and give them a piece of my mind.
Yeah!

440
00:19:38,944 --> 00:19:40,445
Oh, they're back in their apartment.

441
00:19:40,445 --> 00:19:41,947
It was too cold outside.

442
00:19:41,947 --> 00:19:43,949
LUCY: Oh...
They sold us the last tickets.

443
00:19:43,949 --> 00:19:46,451
Oh, they're back in their apartment,
are they?

444
00:19:46,451 --> 00:19:48,453
Well, we'll dedicate the next number

445
00:19:48,453 --> 00:19:49,955
to Fred and Ethel Mertz--

446
00:19:49,955 --> 00:19:53,458
an old Cuban folk dance called "El
Break-o the Lease-o."

447
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:56,962
"El Break-o the Lease-o"?
Yes.

448
00:19:56,962 --> 00:19:59,464
How does this old Cuban folk dance
go?

449
00:19:59,464 --> 00:20:00,465
Da-dum, da-dum, da-dum

450
00:20:00,465 --> 00:20:01,466
Da-da-da, da-da-da, da-dum...

451
00:20:01,466 --> 00:20:04,469
Oh, that one!
That one!

452
00:20:04,469 --> 00:20:05,971
Everybody!

453
00:20:05,971 --> 00:20:08,974
(band plays "Mexican Hat Dance")

454
00:20:21,987 --> 00:20:24,990
(door buzzing incessantly)

455
00:20:29,995 --> 00:20:31,997
(music continuing)

456
00:20:43,008 --> 00:20:45,010
(music stops)

457
00:21:02,527 --> 00:21:04,029
(coughing)

458
00:21:06,031 --> 00:21:08,533
Okay...

459
00:21:08,533 --> 00:21:10,035
Okay, you win.

460
00:21:10,035 --> 00:21:12,037
Here's your lease.

461
00:21:12,037 --> 00:21:13,538
Ba da...
ba-da-dah...

462
00:21:13,538 --> 00:21:16,541
(band resumes playing "Mexican Hat
Dance")

463
00:21:38,814 --> 00:21:39,815
Is that all, honey?

464
00:21:39,815 --> 00:21:40,816
I think so.

465
00:21:40,816 --> 00:21:42,317
Gee, it'll certainly be good

466
00:21:42,317 --> 00:21:44,820
to get out of this joint, won't it?

467
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:46,822
Yeah. Did you tell Ethel we were
moving today?

468
00:21:46,822 --> 00:21:49,324
Well, I haven't seen her since she
brought up the lease.

469
00:21:49,324 --> 00:21:50,325
I mailed her a note

470
00:21:50,826 --> 00:21:52,828
telling her to come up and get the
keys today.

471
00:21:52,828 --> 00:21:54,329
What shall I do about this?

472
00:21:54,329 --> 00:21:55,330
What is it?

473
00:21:55,330 --> 00:21:57,332
It's a picture of us and Fred and
Ethel

474
00:21:57,833 --> 00:21:59,334
taken in Atlantic City last summer.

475
00:21:59,835 --> 00:22:01,336
Oh.

476
00:22:01,336 --> 00:22:03,338
We sure had a lot of fun there,
didn't we?

477
00:22:03,338 --> 00:22:04,339
Yeah.

478
00:22:04,339 --> 00:22:06,341
What shall I do, throw it away?

479
00:22:06,341 --> 00:22:08,343
Oh, no, no, I better pack it.

480
00:22:08,343 --> 00:22:09,845
Huh?

481
00:22:09,845 --> 00:22:12,848
Well, we can always cut them out with
a scissors.

482
00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:16,852
What are all these things here?

483
00:22:16,852 --> 00:22:19,855
Oh, they're some things I borrowed
from Ethel.

484
00:22:19,855 --> 00:22:21,356
She has a lot of my things, too

485
00:22:21,857 --> 00:22:22,858
if she hasn't sold them.

486
00:22:23,358 --> 00:22:26,361
You know, I got a lot of tools that
belong to Fred.

487
00:22:26,361 --> 00:22:28,363
Some of them we bought together.

488
00:22:28,363 --> 00:22:29,865
What shall I do with those?

489
00:22:29,865 --> 00:22:31,366
I don't know.

490
00:22:31,366 --> 00:22:34,369
Gee, it's amazing we could have been
such good friends

491
00:22:34,870 --> 00:22:36,371
with a couple of stinkers.

492
00:22:36,371 --> 00:22:40,375
Yeah... we sure had a lot of fun in
the last nine years...

493
00:22:40,375 --> 00:22:42,377
until they showed their true colors.

494
00:22:42,377 --> 00:22:43,879
Yeah.

495
00:22:43,879 --> 00:22:46,882
Well, that just shows you how sneaky
they are.

496
00:22:46,882 --> 00:22:48,383
Yeah.

497
00:22:48,383 --> 00:22:50,886
Yeah.
Here, honey, you want some paper for
that?

498
00:22:50,886 --> 00:22:52,387
(door buzzer)

499
00:23:01,897 --> 00:23:03,899
Come in, come in, please.

500
00:23:16,912 --> 00:23:18,413
All these are yours.

501
00:23:18,413 --> 00:23:20,415
Oh, thanks.

502
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:25,921
Uh...

503
00:23:25,921 --> 00:23:27,422
These are yours, I guess.

504
00:23:27,422 --> 00:23:28,924
Thanks.
It's all right.

505
00:23:28,924 --> 00:23:30,926
Here's some things of yours

506
00:23:30,926 --> 00:23:33,929
that somehow got into my apartment.

507
00:23:33,929 --> 00:23:35,430
Thanks.

508
00:23:35,430 --> 00:23:37,432
There are some of your things

509
00:23:37,432 --> 00:23:39,434
that I managed to get hold of.

510
00:23:41,436 --> 00:23:42,437
It's all there.

511
00:23:42,437 --> 00:23:44,439
You can count it if you like.

512
00:23:44,439 --> 00:23:48,443
Oh, well, that won't be necessary,
Mrs. Mertz.

513
00:23:48,944 --> 00:23:51,446
(crying): I trust you.

514
00:23:53,448 --> 00:23:55,450
You do?

515
00:23:55,450 --> 00:23:58,453
Uh...

516
00:23:58,453 --> 00:24:00,455
Uh...

517
00:24:02,457 --> 00:24:04,459
Uh...

518
00:24:04,459 --> 00:24:05,961
look, uh, Fred, uh

519
00:24:05,961 --> 00:24:08,463
it doesn't matter to me, you know

520
00:24:08,463 --> 00:24:11,466
but, uh, for some crazy reason or
other

521
00:24:11,466 --> 00:24:13,468
I think Lucy wants to stay.

522
00:24:13,468 --> 00:24:14,970
Don't you, Lucy?

523
00:24:14,970 --> 00:24:18,473
(bawling)

524
00:24:18,473 --> 00:24:20,475
Well, it doesn't matter to me either

525
00:24:20,475 --> 00:24:21,977
but it's, uh, up to Ethel.

526
00:24:21,977 --> 00:24:23,478
What do you say, honey?

527
00:24:23,478 --> 00:24:26,481
(bawling)

528
00:24:30,485 --> 00:24:33,488
(both wailing)

529
00:24:33,488 --> 00:24:35,991
I... (chuckles)

530
00:24:36,491 --> 00:24:37,993
You heard what the girls said.

531
00:24:37,993 --> 00:24:39,995
I guess we're staying, eh?

532
00:24:39,995 --> 00:24:40,996
Yeah.

533
00:24:40,996 --> 00:24:43,999
Only-Only this time, I want a long
lease

534
00:24:43,999 --> 00:24:47,002
so that we don't ever get kicked out.

535
00:24:47,002 --> 00:24:49,004
Well...

536
00:24:49,004 --> 00:24:53,008
Fred...

537
00:24:53,008 --> 00:24:55,010
I just happen to have a new lease

538
00:24:55,510 --> 00:24:56,511
already made out.

539
00:24:56,511 --> 00:24:58,013
Oh, how wonderful!

540
00:24:58,013 --> 00:25:00,015
Let's...
Help me unpack!

541
00:25:00,015 --> 00:25:01,016
Unpack?!
Yeah! Yeah!

542
00:25:01,016 --> 00:25:02,517
You're staying!

543
00:25:02,517 --> 00:25:05,020
(all talking excitedly)

Gee, two vanloads of furniture.

4
00:00:32,766 --> 00:00:34,768
What can they do with so much junk?

5
00:00:34,768 --> 00:00:36,269
Mmm. Where'd they ever get that sofa?

6
00:00:36,269 --> 00:00:37,270
Isn't that a...?

7
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:40,774
Are you still hanging out that
window?

8
00:00:40,774 --> 00:00:42,776
Now, come on, honey...

9
00:00:42,776 --> 00:00:44,778
I want my breakfast.

10
00:00:44,778 --> 00:00:47,280
There's some coffee over there.

11
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,783
I'll make you some soft-boiled chairs
in a minute.

12
00:00:49,783 --> 00:00:51,284
What?
I mean, eggs.

13
00:00:51,284 --> 00:00:53,286
Look at those chairs, will you,
Ethel?

14
00:00:53,286 --> 00:00:54,287
Ugh.

15
00:00:54,287 --> 00:00:55,789
Ay-ay-ay-ay-ay.

16
00:00:57,791 --> 00:00:58,792
FRED: Hi, Ricks.

17
00:00:58,792 --> 00:00:59,793
Hello, Fred.

18
00:00:59,793 --> 00:01:01,294
Ethel up here?

19
00:01:01,294 --> 00:01:02,796
Oh, there she is.

20
00:01:02,796 --> 00:01:04,297
The nosy twins.

21
00:01:04,297 --> 00:01:06,299
They've been hanging out that window

22
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:07,801
for an hour, snooping.

23
00:01:07,801 --> 00:01:11,304
You'd think they'd never seen anyone
move into an apartment before.

24
00:01:11,304 --> 00:01:13,306
Do you want some coffee?
No, thanks.

25
00:01:13,306 --> 00:01:15,308
Ethel, look at those china lamps.

26
00:01:15,308 --> 00:01:17,310
He shouldn't try to balance that lamp

27
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:18,812
on that table like that.

28
00:01:18,812 --> 00:01:21,815
Oh, honey, now, those moving men know
what they're doing.

29
00:01:21,815 --> 00:01:22,816
They never drop any...

30
00:01:22,816 --> 00:01:24,317
(both gasp)

31
00:01:27,821 --> 00:01:29,322
(crash)

32
00:01:29,322 --> 00:01:30,323
Oh...
Oh...

33
00:01:30,323 --> 00:01:32,325
Well, I guess one lamp's better than
none.

34
00:01:32,826 --> 00:01:33,827
Ethel, come out of that window.

35
00:01:33,827 --> 00:01:35,829
Suppose the new tenant should see
you.

36
00:01:35,829 --> 00:01:38,331
There's nobody down there but the
moving men.

37
00:01:38,331 --> 00:01:41,334
They won't be satisfied until they
see every last bit

38
00:01:41,334 --> 00:01:43,336
of those people's, uh, paraphernalia.

39
00:01:43,336 --> 00:01:45,839
Par...

40
00:01:45,839 --> 00:01:47,340
Que no va a estar conforme

41
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:49,342
hasta que no ven el ultimo trasto

42
00:01:49,342 --> 00:01:50,343
de los nuevos vecinos.

43
00:01:50,343 --> 00:01:52,345
Oh, paraphernalia.

44
00:01:54,848 --> 00:01:57,350
You understand Spanish?

45
00:01:57,350 --> 00:01:58,852
No.

46
00:01:58,852 --> 00:02:00,854
Now, come out of there, both of you.

47
00:02:00,854 --> 00:02:02,856
Come on! You've done enough snooping.

48
00:02:02,856 --> 00:02:04,858
We're not snooping.

49
00:02:04,858 --> 00:02:07,360
I'm surprised they're not using
binoculars.

50
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,862
Oh, I forgot I had them.

51
00:02:10,864 --> 00:02:14,367
Say, that must be the new tenant
coming up now.

52
00:02:14,367 --> 00:02:15,869
Isn't he handsome?

53
00:02:15,869 --> 00:02:16,870
"Handsome"?

54
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:17,871
How can you call him handsome

55
00:02:18,371 --> 00:02:20,373
with those bugged-out eyes and long
hairy legs?

56
00:02:20,373 --> 00:02:21,875
Huh?

57
00:02:21,875 --> 00:02:24,377
Hey, you got a fly on the lens.

58
00:02:24,377 --> 00:02:26,379
Oh!

59
00:02:26,379 --> 00:02:28,381
Ooh, say, he is handsome.

60
00:02:28,381 --> 00:02:30,383
Let me see through those things.

61
00:02:30,383 --> 00:02:31,885
Ethel!

62
00:02:31,885 --> 00:02:34,888
Curiosity killed the cat, eh, Fred?

63
00:02:34,888 --> 00:02:37,390
Yeah, but we'll never get a break
like that.

64
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:38,391
(laughing)

65
00:02:38,391 --> 00:02:40,393
Now, why can't they wait until
tomorrow

66
00:02:40,393 --> 00:02:41,895
to see what those people look like?

67
00:02:41,895 --> 00:02:42,896
I don't know.

68
00:02:42,896 --> 00:02:44,898
It doesn't make any difference to me

69
00:02:44,898 --> 00:02:45,899
what they look like.

70
00:02:45,899 --> 00:02:46,900
Me, neither.

71
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:47,901
Hey, who was that?

72
00:02:47,901 --> 00:02:49,903
Do you suppose that could be his
wife?

73
00:02:49,903 --> 00:02:53,406
(gasping): Look at that gorgeous
blond hair.

74
00:02:53,406 --> 00:02:56,910
LUCY: Ethel Mertz!

75
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:58,411
How do you dare let a woman like that

76
00:02:58,912 --> 00:03:00,914
that has a figure like that, come
into this building?

77
00:03:00,914 --> 00:03:02,916
Just a minute.
That's the biggest mista...

78
00:03:02,916 --> 00:03:04,918
Nothing doing.
Give me that, will you?
Hey, fellas!

79
00:03:04,918 --> 00:03:06,419
Fred, give me that thing!

80
00:03:08,922 --> 00:03:10,924
Fellas, watch it, will you?

81
00:03:11,424 --> 00:03:13,927
Gee, I'm sure glad men aren't nosy.

82
00:03:13,927 --> 00:03:14,928
Yeah.

83
00:03:14,928 --> 00:03:16,429
Wow, wow.

84
00:03:16,429 --> 00:03:17,430
(whistles)

85
00:03:17,931 --> 00:03:19,432
All right, fellas, break it up, will
you?

86
00:03:19,432 --> 00:03:21,434
We were here first.
Get your own window.

87
00:03:21,434 --> 00:03:23,937
Ah... they gone inside.

88
00:03:23,937 --> 00:03:24,938
(coughs)

89
00:03:24,938 --> 00:03:25,939
That's all, girls.

90
00:03:25,939 --> 00:03:27,440
Yeah, the show is over.
Here.

91
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,441
Well, something tells me

92
00:03:28,942 --> 00:03:30,443
I'm going to be doing a lot of
repairing

93
00:03:30,443 --> 00:03:31,444
in that apartment.

94
00:03:31,444 --> 00:03:32,946
Ah...

95
00:03:32,946 --> 00:03:33,947
You need a helper?

96
00:03:33,947 --> 00:03:34,948
Have you got a card?

97
00:03:35,448 --> 00:03:36,449
I'll join.

98
00:03:36,449 --> 00:03:38,451
Okay, Ethel, what's the dirt on the
new tenants?

99
00:03:38,451 --> 00:03:39,452
Where are they from?

100
00:03:39,452 --> 00:03:40,453
I don't know.

101
00:03:40,453 --> 00:03:41,955
What business is he in?

102
00:03:41,955 --> 00:03:42,956
I don't know.

103
00:03:42,956 --> 00:03:44,457
Do they have any children?

104
00:03:44,457 --> 00:03:45,458
I don't know.

105
00:03:45,458 --> 00:03:48,962
What's the matter with you? Your
radar bent?

106
00:03:48,962 --> 00:03:50,964
No, they rented the apartment through
an agent.

107
00:03:50,964 --> 00:03:52,966
All I know is their name is O'Brien

108
00:03:52,966 --> 00:03:54,968
she's a blond, and they've got one
broken lamp.

109
00:03:54,968 --> 00:03:55,969
Well, what are we waiting for?

110
00:03:55,969 --> 00:03:57,971
Let's go down and call on them.
Okay, let's go.

111
00:03:57,971 --> 00:03:59,422
Now, now, wait a minute, Ethel.

112
00:03:59,422 --> 00:04:00,924
Give them a chance to get settled.

113
00:04:00,924 --> 00:04:02,926
Yeah, I guess he's right.

114
00:04:02,926 --> 00:04:04,928
No sense rushing things.

115
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:08,431
(both sigh)

116
00:04:08,431 --> 00:04:09,933
Okay, let's go.

117
00:04:13,937 --> 00:04:14,938
Lucy, come on!

118
00:04:15,438 --> 00:04:18,441
Well, I'm trying to, but there's a
very strong current here.

119
00:04:18,942 --> 00:04:19,943
Ricky, let go.
Come here, Lucy.

120
00:04:19,943 --> 00:04:21,444
You're not going to go downstairs.

121
00:04:21,444 --> 00:04:22,445
Why not?

122
00:04:22,445 --> 00:04:24,948
Because there's nothing downstairs
that concerns you.

123
00:04:24,948 --> 00:04:26,950
You'll have to give me a better
reason than that.

124
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:28,952
You just go in the kitchen and fix my
breakfast.

125
00:04:28,952 --> 00:04:31,454
Oh... we'll go down later, Ethel.

126
00:04:31,454 --> 00:04:32,956
His majesty is hungry.

127
00:04:32,956 --> 00:04:34,958
Okay, there's plenty of time.

128
00:04:34,958 --> 00:04:37,961
His majesty has another proclamation.

129
00:04:37,961 --> 00:04:40,964
I don't want you to go down there at
all.

130
00:04:40,964 --> 00:04:42,966
"At all" as in "never"?

131
00:04:42,966 --> 00:04:45,969
Right.

132
00:04:45,969 --> 00:04:47,971
Now, repeat after me:

133
00:04:47,971 --> 00:04:50,473
I, Lucy Ricardo, promise never to set
foot

134
00:04:50,473 --> 00:04:51,975
in the O'Brien apartment.

135
00:04:51,975 --> 00:04:53,476
Oh, really.

136
00:04:53,476 --> 00:04:55,478
Come on.

137
00:04:55,478 --> 00:04:58,481
I, Lucy Ricardo, promise never to set
foot...

138
00:04:58,481 --> 00:05:00,984
Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a
minute.

139
00:05:00,984 --> 00:05:01,985
Uh-huh.

140
00:05:03,486 --> 00:05:04,487
Now.

141
00:05:04,487 --> 00:05:06,990
I, Lucy Ricardo, promise never to set
foot

142
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:08,992
in the O'Brien apartment-- okay?

143
00:05:08,992 --> 00:05:09,993
Okay.

144
00:05:09,993 --> 00:05:11,995
Okay.

145
00:05:19,168 --> 00:05:20,670
OPERATOR: Information.

146
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:22,672
Do you have a telephone number

147
00:05:22,672 --> 00:05:25,174
for O'Brien, 623 East 68th Street?

148
00:05:25,174 --> 00:05:27,176
They just moved in today.

149
00:05:27,176 --> 00:05:29,178
One moment, please.

150
00:05:29,178 --> 00:05:30,680
Fred, are you going to be long?

151
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:31,681
I want to use the phone.

152
00:05:31,681 --> 00:05:33,182
No, no, I'll just be a minute.

153
00:05:33,182 --> 00:05:34,684
I thought I'd call downstairs

154
00:05:34,684 --> 00:05:35,685
and see if there's anything

155
00:05:35,685 --> 00:05:38,187
they wanted me to do...
Are you calling the O'Briens?

156
00:05:38,187 --> 00:05:40,189
They'll call you if they want
anything done.

157
00:05:40,189 --> 00:05:41,691
You're never too busy to do anything

158
00:05:41,691 --> 00:05:42,692
when there's a blond around.

159
00:05:43,192 --> 00:05:43,693
Are you calling them?

160
00:05:44,193 --> 00:05:46,195
How can you think a thing like that?

161
00:05:46,195 --> 00:05:48,197
Oh, hello, Mr. Thompson?

162
00:05:48,197 --> 00:05:50,700
How's the plumbing holding up down
there?

163
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:52,201
Well, good.

164
00:05:52,201 --> 00:05:54,203
No, no, no, not at all, thanks.

165
00:05:55,204 --> 00:05:56,706
Help yourself.

166
00:05:59,709 --> 00:06:07,216
The number for the O'Briens is Murray
Hill 5-9-5-7-0.

167
00:06:21,981 --> 00:06:22,982
Stick 'em up.

168
00:06:22,982 --> 00:06:24,484
(gasps)

169
00:06:24,484 --> 00:06:25,985
Tom, you scared me to death.

170
00:06:25,985 --> 00:06:27,487
Hiya, baby.

171
00:06:27,487 --> 00:06:28,988
Hi. Put this on the mantel for me,
will you?

172
00:06:29,489 --> 00:06:31,491
Forget about unpacking.
We've got a script to learn.

173
00:06:31,491 --> 00:06:34,994
But, Tom, this place...
Look, honey, this television show
goes on Friday night.

174
00:06:34,994 --> 00:06:35,995
We don't even know our lines yet.

175
00:06:35,995 --> 00:06:37,497
Well, I know mine.

176
00:06:37,497 --> 00:06:38,998
All right, smarty.

177
00:06:38,998 --> 00:06:40,500
I'll help you with yours.

178
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:41,501
Good. Now, let's see.

179
00:06:41,501 --> 00:06:43,503
I think I know that first scene,
baby.

180
00:06:43,503 --> 00:06:45,505
Let's start with the second one.

181
00:06:45,505 --> 00:06:47,006
All right.

182
00:06:47,006 --> 00:06:48,508
Now, where are we?

183
00:06:48,508 --> 00:06:51,010
(Russian accent): Are you sure this
is the right place?

184
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:53,012
(Russian accent): I am positive.

185
00:06:53,012 --> 00:06:56,015
They live in this building on an
upper floor.

186
00:06:56,015 --> 00:06:57,016
Good.

187
00:06:57,016 --> 00:07:00,019
Let me go over the plan with you once
more.

188
00:07:00,019 --> 00:07:02,021
We do away with them both--

189
00:07:02,021 --> 00:07:05,525
dispose of the bodies and assume
their identities.

190
00:07:05,525 --> 00:07:07,026
We become them, yes?

191
00:07:07,026 --> 00:07:08,528
Exactly.

192
00:07:10,029 --> 00:07:12,031
It is dangerous

193
00:07:12,031 --> 00:07:14,534
but it is our only chance to stay in
this country

194
00:07:14,534 --> 00:07:16,035
so we can blow up the capital.

195
00:07:16,536 --> 00:07:17,537
Shh!

196
00:07:17,537 --> 00:07:21,040
(normal voice): You know, that's
pretty corny dialogue.

197
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:23,543
Yeah, even for television.

198
00:07:26,546 --> 00:07:29,048
Well, it's a living.

199
00:07:29,048 --> 00:07:30,550
Let's see, where were we?

200
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:35,555
(Russian accent): You know, my little
chicken, this job will not be easy.

201
00:07:35,555 --> 00:07:37,557
They're clever and physically strong.

202
00:07:37,557 --> 00:07:41,561
(normal voice): "Physically
strong"...

203
00:07:41,561 --> 00:07:44,063
"Physically strong"...
Yeah, I thought you knew your part,
baby.

204
00:07:44,063 --> 00:07:45,565
That's the first one I've missed.

205
00:07:45,565 --> 00:07:47,567
It's, "Especially..."

206
00:07:47,567 --> 00:07:51,571
(Russian accent): Especially the
red-haired one.

207
00:07:51,571 --> 00:07:54,574
Did you notice those big bulging
muscles

208
00:07:54,574 --> 00:07:56,576
those-those popping eyes

209
00:07:56,576 --> 00:07:59,579
and-and that horrible, ugly, leering
face?

210
00:07:59,579 --> 00:08:02,582
I will take care of that one,
silently

211
00:08:02,582 --> 00:08:04,083
with a knife in the back.

212
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:07,086
(crunching)

213
00:08:07,086 --> 00:08:09,589
You will handle the other.

214
00:08:09,589 --> 00:08:12,091
I will, on one condition--

215
00:08:12,091 --> 00:08:15,094
that you take me out to lunch.

216
00:08:15,094 --> 00:08:16,095
Huh?

217
00:08:18,097 --> 00:08:19,599
It's 3:00 and I'm starved.
Ah.

218
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:21,601
I haven't had anything to eat since
breakfast.

219
00:08:21,601 --> 00:08:23,102
All right.

220
00:08:23,102 --> 00:08:26,105
Come on, let's go down to the
drugstore and have a sandwich.

221
00:08:26,105 --> 00:08:27,607
We can finish rehearsing when we get
back.

222
00:08:27,607 --> 00:08:29,108
Okay, baby.

223
00:08:29,108 --> 00:08:33,613
(Russian accent): I will take care of
that one, silently

224
00:08:33,613 --> 00:08:35,615
with a knife in the back.

225
00:08:35,615 --> 00:08:38,618
(crunching)

226
00:08:38,618 --> 00:08:40,620
Hey...
(crunching)

227
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,121
Oh.

228
00:08:42,121 --> 00:08:45,124
(Russian accent): Wait.

229
00:08:45,124 --> 00:08:47,126
Good, they have not seen us.

230
00:08:47,126 --> 00:08:48,628
The coast is clear.

231
00:08:48,628 --> 00:08:51,631
(laughing): Darling, you're such a
fool.

232
00:08:51,631 --> 00:08:54,634
You know, baby, I think we're going
to like this place.

233
00:08:56,836 --> 00:08:59,338
Mrs. O'Brien?

234
00:08:59,338 --> 00:09:01,841
Mrs. O'Brien, it's me, the landlady.

235
00:09:01,841 --> 00:09:04,343
Is there anything I can help you
with?

236
00:09:06,846 --> 00:09:08,848
Mrs. O'Brien?

237
00:09:12,351 --> 00:09:13,853
Ew.

238
00:09:18,357 --> 00:09:19,859
(whispers): Hi, Ethel.

239
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,362
Lucy.

240
00:09:23,362 --> 00:09:24,864
What about your promise?

241
00:09:24,864 --> 00:09:25,865
Well, I promised Ricky

242
00:09:26,365 --> 00:09:27,867
I wouldn't set foot in this apartment

243
00:09:27,867 --> 00:09:30,369
but that doesn't mean I can't stay
out here in the hall

244
00:09:30,369 --> 00:09:31,871
and give a long-distance snoop.

245
00:09:31,871 --> 00:09:32,872
Aren't they home?

246
00:09:32,872 --> 00:09:33,873
No.

247
00:09:33,873 --> 00:09:36,375
I had to wait all morning and half
the afternoon

248
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:37,376
for them to leave.

249
00:09:37,376 --> 00:09:38,878
(laughing): What'd you find?

250
00:09:39,378 --> 00:09:40,379
Well...

251
00:09:40,379 --> 00:09:43,382
Lucy, what period is this?

252
00:09:43,382 --> 00:09:46,385
19th-century provincial?

253
00:09:46,385 --> 00:09:48,888
Looks like 20th-century ugly.

254
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:52,391
What else is there?

255
00:09:52,391 --> 00:09:53,392
These lamps.

256
00:09:53,392 --> 00:09:55,394
Now that I see these lamps up close

257
00:09:55,394 --> 00:09:57,396
it's too bad they didn't drop both of
them.

258
00:09:57,396 --> 00:09:59,398
Where are they?

259
00:09:59,398 --> 00:10:00,399
Here.

260
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:01,400
Oh...

261
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,402
Gosh, this is the most frustrating
thing

262
00:10:03,402 --> 00:10:04,403
that ever happened to me.

263
00:10:04,403 --> 00:10:05,905
Wait, I'll bring one over to you.

264
00:10:05,905 --> 00:10:07,907
No, listen-- just because I promised
Ricky

265
00:10:07,907 --> 00:10:09,909
that I wouldn't set foot in this
apartment

266
00:10:09,909 --> 00:10:11,911
doesn't mean I can't set knees in.

267
00:10:11,911 --> 00:10:13,913
So long as I keep my feet off the
floor

268
00:10:13,913 --> 00:10:15,915
I'm an honest woman, right?

269
00:10:15,915 --> 00:10:17,416
(chuckles)

270
00:10:17,416 --> 00:10:18,417
(gasps)

271
00:10:23,923 --> 00:10:25,925
He better see his dentist.

272
00:10:32,431 --> 00:10:35,434
Oh, fine thing-- she removed all the
price tags.

273
00:10:37,436 --> 00:10:39,438
Hey, look at this.

274
00:10:39,939 --> 00:10:41,440
What is that?

275
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,441
Early Pullman.

276
00:10:42,441 --> 00:10:43,442
RICKY: Lucy!

277
00:10:43,442 --> 00:10:44,944
Ricky's home.

278
00:10:44,944 --> 00:10:46,445
Lucy!

279
00:10:46,445 --> 00:10:47,947
He's coming down here.
What'll I do?

280
00:10:47,947 --> 00:10:49,949
Hide someplace.
I'll get rid of him.

281
00:10:49,949 --> 00:10:50,950
But where?

282
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:51,951
In the closet.

283
00:10:55,454 --> 00:10:57,456
Oh, hi, Ethel.

284
00:10:57,456 --> 00:10:59,959
I have a perfect right to be here.

285
00:11:02,962 --> 00:11:03,963
Who said you didn't?

286
00:11:04,463 --> 00:11:04,964
Well, uh...

287
00:11:05,464 --> 00:11:06,966
(chuckling): I just came up to see

288
00:11:06,966 --> 00:11:09,468
if everything was all right, and
everything's all right.

289
00:11:09,468 --> 00:11:10,469
Well, let's go.

290
00:11:10,469 --> 00:11:11,971
You seen Lucy?

291
00:11:11,971 --> 00:11:13,973
Lucy who?

292
00:11:16,475 --> 00:11:18,477
Lucy Ricardo, my wife.

293
00:11:18,477 --> 00:11:19,979
Oh, that Lucy.

294
00:11:19,979 --> 00:11:21,480
Yeah, that Lucy.

295
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:22,982
No, I haven't seen her.

296
00:11:22,982 --> 00:11:23,983
Let's go.

297
00:11:46,505 --> 00:11:50,509
(voices approaching)

298
00:11:50,509 --> 00:11:54,013
(Russian accent): Are you sure this
is the right place?

299
00:11:54,013 --> 00:11:56,015
I am positive.

300
00:11:56,015 --> 00:11:58,517
They live in this building

301
00:11:58,517 --> 00:12:00,019
on an upper floor.

302
00:12:00,019 --> 00:12:02,021
MR. O'BRIEN: Good.

303
00:12:02,021 --> 00:12:05,024
Let me go over the plan with you once
more.

304
00:12:05,024 --> 00:12:07,026
We do away with them both--

305
00:12:07,026 --> 00:12:10,529
dispose of the bodies and assume
their identities.

306
00:12:10,529 --> 00:12:13,032
MRS. O'BRIEN: We become them, yes?

307
00:12:13,032 --> 00:12:14,533
Exactly.

308
00:12:14,533 --> 00:12:16,035
It is dangerous

309
00:12:16,535 --> 00:12:20,039
but it is our only chance to stay in
this country

310
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:22,041
so we can blow up the capital.

311
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:23,542
Shh!

312
00:12:25,544 --> 00:12:28,047
You know, my little chicken

313
00:12:28,047 --> 00:12:30,549
this job will not be easy.

314
00:12:30,549 --> 00:12:34,053
They are clever and physically
strong.

315
00:12:34,053 --> 00:12:37,556
Especially the red-haired one.

316
00:12:37,556 --> 00:12:39,558
Did you notice...

317
00:12:39,558 --> 00:12:43,562
did you notice those big bulging
muscles

318
00:12:43,562 --> 00:12:46,565
those popping eyes

319
00:12:46,565 --> 00:12:51,070
and that horrible, ugly, leering
face?

320
00:12:54,073 --> 00:12:58,077
I will take care of that one,
silently

321
00:12:58,077 --> 00:12:59,578
with a knife in the back.

322
00:12:59,578 --> 00:13:02,581
(crunching)

323
00:13:02,581 --> 00:13:04,083
You will handle the other.

324
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:06,085
Do not worry.

325
00:13:06,585 --> 00:13:08,087
In a dark alley

326
00:13:08,087 --> 00:13:11,590
a loop of silver wire around the
neck.

327
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:13,592
One tug-- poof!

328
00:13:13,592 --> 00:13:15,094
(laughing)

329
00:13:16,095 --> 00:13:18,097
Wait...

330
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,103
I do not know if you actually realize

331
00:13:24,103 --> 00:13:26,105
the importance of this mission.

332
00:13:26,605 --> 00:13:29,108
What a great honor it is for you and
I

333
00:13:29,108 --> 00:13:31,110
to have been chosen to perform it.

334
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:33,612
It is a crowning glory.

335
00:13:34,113 --> 00:13:36,615
It makes us the most trusted agents

336
00:13:36,615 --> 00:13:38,617
in our nation's service.

337
00:13:38,617 --> 00:13:42,121
I am overwhelmed with pride.

338
00:13:49,128 --> 00:13:50,629
Darling...

339
00:13:50,629 --> 00:13:52,131
when this assignment is over

340
00:13:52,131 --> 00:13:54,133
and we return to our native homeland

341
00:13:54,133 --> 00:13:55,634
I will tell you something

342
00:13:55,634 --> 00:13:58,137
that I have wanted to say to you for
a long, long time.

343
00:13:58,137 --> 00:13:59,638
Tell me now.

344
00:13:59,638 --> 00:14:03,142
No, there is no time for personal
emotion.

345
00:14:03,142 --> 00:14:05,144
We have a job to do.

346
00:14:05,144 --> 00:14:07,146
That is all that counts.

347
00:14:07,146 --> 00:14:08,647
Tell me now.

348
00:14:08,647 --> 00:14:09,648
No.

349
00:14:09,648 --> 00:14:11,650
I think I can guess.

350
00:14:12,151 --> 00:14:14,653
What do you think it is?

351
00:14:15,154 --> 00:14:16,155
Tell me.

352
00:14:16,155 --> 00:14:18,657
No, guess.

353
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:22,661
Kiss me.

354
00:14:22,661 --> 00:14:25,164
Ah, you guessed.

355
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:32,671
Enough of this.

356
00:14:33,172 --> 00:14:35,674
We are on a sacred mission.

357
00:14:35,674 --> 00:14:37,676
We cannot be weak.

358
00:14:37,676 --> 00:14:39,678
You are right

359
00:14:39,678 --> 00:14:44,683
but I'll remember this until we can
be weak again.

360
00:14:44,683 --> 00:14:46,685
Now, my little chicken

361
00:14:46,685 --> 00:14:49,688
are all our preparations in order?

362
00:15:13,212 --> 00:15:15,714
Now, my little chicken...

363
00:15:17,716 --> 00:15:21,720
Now, my little chicken, are all our
preparations in...

364
00:15:28,227 --> 00:15:32,231
Now, my little chicken, are all our
preparations in order?

365
00:15:34,733 --> 00:15:36,235
You have the knife?

366
00:15:36,235 --> 00:15:37,736
Yes.

367
00:15:37,736 --> 00:15:39,238
The silver wire?

368
00:15:39,238 --> 00:15:40,239
Yes.

369
00:15:40,239 --> 00:15:41,240
The map?

370
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,241
Yes.

371
00:15:42,241 --> 00:15:43,242
The explosives?

372
00:15:43,242 --> 00:15:44,243
Yes.

373
00:15:44,243 --> 00:15:46,245
The two-way wrist television set?

374
00:15:46,245 --> 00:15:47,746
Yes.

375
00:15:47,746 --> 00:15:49,248
Good.

376
00:15:54,253 --> 00:15:55,254
I cannot...

377
00:15:55,254 --> 00:15:58,257
I cannot think as a patriot.

378
00:15:58,257 --> 00:16:01,260
My blood is pounding in my ears.

379
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:04,763
As a woman, I beg of you...

380
00:16:04,763 --> 00:16:06,765
be weak again.

381
00:16:06,765 --> 00:16:10,769
The roar of my blood is loud and
deep.

382
00:16:10,769 --> 00:16:14,273
What a tragedy my life has been up to
now.

383
00:16:14,273 --> 00:16:17,776
I see for the first time that to love
is to live.

384
00:16:17,776 --> 00:16:20,279
(normal voice): Hey, not bad, eh?

385
00:16:35,761 --> 00:16:36,762
That's gin.

386
00:16:36,762 --> 00:16:38,263
Aw, Ricky.

387
00:16:38,263 --> 00:16:39,264
That's all.

388
00:16:39,264 --> 00:16:41,266
Oh, no, let's play one more hand,
Ricky, huh?

389
00:16:41,266 --> 00:16:42,267
RICKY: All right.

390
00:16:42,267 --> 00:16:43,769
Oh, there you are, Ethel.

391
00:16:43,769 --> 00:16:44,770
Have you got the pass key?

392
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:46,271
I want to check the heat

393
00:16:46,271 --> 00:16:48,273
in Miss Lewis's apartment.

394
00:16:52,277 --> 00:16:54,279
Lucy, what are you doing?

395
00:16:54,279 --> 00:16:55,280
They're after us.
Help me.

396
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,281
Well, what happened?

397
00:16:56,281 --> 00:16:57,282
What are you talking about?

398
00:16:57,282 --> 00:16:58,283
Who's after who?

399
00:16:58,283 --> 00:16:59,785
The O'Briens, Ethel.

400
00:16:59,785 --> 00:17:01,787
You're nurturing two vipers in your
brownstone bosom.

401
00:17:02,287 --> 00:17:04,790
What?

402
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:07,292
Lucy... have you been snooping
downstairs?

403
00:17:07,292 --> 00:17:08,794
Yes, I've been snooping

404
00:17:08,794 --> 00:17:10,295
and it's a good thing I did, too.

405
00:17:10,295 --> 00:17:12,297
Those people are foreign enemy
agents.

406
00:17:12,297 --> 00:17:13,799
They're going to rub us out

407
00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:15,801
and they're not going to use an
eraser either.

408
00:17:15,801 --> 00:17:18,303
Lucy, you mean to tell me that you
went downstairs

409
00:17:18,303 --> 00:17:19,805
after you promised me not to?

410
00:17:19,805 --> 00:17:22,808
Yes, I've been a bad girl and you can
spank me tomorrow

411
00:17:23,308 --> 00:17:24,810
if there's anything left to spank!

412
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:26,812
Well, didn't you hear what I said?

413
00:17:26,812 --> 00:17:27,813
What's the matter with you?

414
00:17:27,813 --> 00:17:28,814
Our lives are in danger!

415
00:17:28,814 --> 00:17:29,815
Now, look, honey

416
00:17:30,315 --> 00:17:32,818
why would those people want to give
us a rubdown?

417
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:35,320
Rub us out!

418
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:36,321
I heard them.

419
00:17:36,321 --> 00:17:38,323
They're going to kill us and assume
our identities.

420
00:17:38,323 --> 00:17:39,324
Why?

421
00:17:39,324 --> 00:17:41,777
So they can blow up the capital.

422
00:17:41,777 --> 00:17:42,778
"Blow up the capital."

423
00:17:42,778 --> 00:17:43,779
Yes!
Now, look, honey...

424
00:17:43,779 --> 00:17:44,780
Now, wait a minute.

425
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:46,281
Maybe we better pay attention to
Lucy.

426
00:17:46,281 --> 00:17:47,783
After all, she was in their
apartment.

427
00:17:47,783 --> 00:17:49,284
Yeah, and I'm going to call the
police.

428
00:17:49,284 --> 00:17:50,285
I got to get them over here.

429
00:17:50,786 --> 00:17:51,787
We got to save the country.

430
00:17:51,787 --> 00:17:53,288
Now, now, look, honey, calm down,
will you?

431
00:17:53,288 --> 00:17:54,790
Let's talk this thing over.

432
00:17:54,790 --> 00:17:56,792
Now, wait a minute.
A lot of talking you're going to do

433
00:17:56,792 --> 00:17:58,794
with a silver wire wrapped around
your neck.

434
00:17:58,794 --> 00:17:59,795
Silver wire?

435
00:17:59,795 --> 00:18:00,796
Yeah!

436
00:18:00,796 --> 00:18:02,297
Aw, honey, you better lie down.

437
00:18:02,297 --> 00:18:03,799
Come on, now.
I don't want to lie down!

438
00:18:03,799 --> 00:18:06,802
If I go, I want to be...
go standing up fighting.

439
00:18:06,802 --> 00:18:09,304
I think it's time to turn on the
furnace.
Good luck, Rick.

440
00:18:09,304 --> 00:18:10,806
And you go with him, Ricky.

441
00:18:10,806 --> 00:18:12,808
All right.
I'll try to settle her down.

442
00:18:12,808 --> 00:18:15,310
Ricky, you're not going to leave me
at a time like this!

443
00:18:15,310 --> 00:18:16,812
When you come back, I might be gone!

444
00:18:16,812 --> 00:18:18,814
Well, if you go, leave me a note

445
00:18:18,814 --> 00:18:21,817
and tell me where I can find my clean
socks.

446
00:18:21,817 --> 00:18:22,818
Ricky!

447
00:18:22,818 --> 00:18:23,819
Why won't anybody believe me?

448
00:18:23,819 --> 00:18:25,320
Oh...
I'm telling you I heard.

449
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:26,822
Oh, come on, now, honey.
I heard it!
I heard it!

450
00:18:27,322 --> 00:18:28,323
Calm down.
I know what I heard!

451
00:18:28,323 --> 00:18:30,826
Now, Lucy, are you sure you heard
right?

452
00:18:30,826 --> 00:18:32,327
Cross my heart and hope to... Oh!

453
00:18:32,327 --> 00:18:33,829
Oh, dear.

454
00:18:33,829 --> 00:18:36,331
Well, I'm not going to sit here like
a sitting duck.

455
00:18:36,331 --> 00:18:37,833
I'm going to call the police.

456
00:18:39,835 --> 00:18:41,837
Operator, give me the police.

457
00:18:41,837 --> 00:18:44,840
(ringing)

458
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:47,843
32nd Precinct.
Sergeant Morton speaking.

459
00:18:47,843 --> 00:18:49,344
Help!

460
00:18:51,346 --> 00:18:52,848
Name, please.

461
00:18:54,850 --> 00:18:56,351
Mrs. Ricky Ricardo.

462
00:18:56,351 --> 00:18:58,353
Send a squad of men over right away.

463
00:18:58,353 --> 00:19:00,355
Send two squads, the whole force.

464
00:19:00,355 --> 00:19:02,357
Address?

465
00:19:02,357 --> 00:19:05,360
623 East 68th Street, and hurry.

466
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:08,864
Now, Mrs. Ricardo, what seems to be
your trouble?

467
00:19:08,864 --> 00:19:11,366
Well... some people that moved in
downstairs

468
00:19:11,366 --> 00:19:12,868
are plotting to kill us.

469
00:19:12,868 --> 00:19:13,869
Do you know these people?

470
00:19:13,869 --> 00:19:15,370
No.

471
00:19:15,370 --> 00:19:17,372
Then, how do you know they're going
to kill you?

472
00:19:17,372 --> 00:19:18,373
I heard them.

473
00:19:18,373 --> 00:19:19,875
I-I just happened to be hiding

474
00:19:19,875 --> 00:19:21,376
in their closet at the time.

475
00:19:21,376 --> 00:19:22,377
I see.

476
00:19:22,377 --> 00:19:25,380
And why do you suppose they want to
kill you?

477
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:26,882
So they can assume our identities

478
00:19:26,882 --> 00:19:28,383
and blow up the capital.

479
00:19:28,383 --> 00:19:29,384
This is serious.

480
00:19:29,384 --> 00:19:30,886
You're darn right it is!

481
00:19:30,886 --> 00:19:33,889
These people are agents of some
foreign government.

482
00:19:33,889 --> 00:19:34,890
What's their names?

483
00:19:34,890 --> 00:19:36,391
O'Brien.

484
00:19:40,896 --> 00:19:45,400
Lady, have you been nipping on the
cooking sherry?

485
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:47,402
Oh, please, you've got to believe me.

486
00:19:47,402 --> 00:19:49,404
I'm-I'm living on borrowed time.

487
00:19:49,404 --> 00:19:51,406
It was only by a very clever ruse

488
00:19:51,406 --> 00:19:53,909
that I managed to escape from their
apartment

489
00:19:53,909 --> 00:19:55,410
right under their eyes.

490
00:19:55,410 --> 00:19:57,412
And how did you manage that?

491
00:19:57,412 --> 00:19:58,914
I pretended to be a chair.

492
00:20:02,918 --> 00:20:05,921
I don't think the police can help
you, madam.

493
00:20:05,921 --> 00:20:07,923
Why don't you call an upholsterer?

494
00:20:09,424 --> 00:20:11,426
Oh, Officer, please, I'm serious.

495
00:20:11,426 --> 00:20:12,928
My life is at stake.

496
00:20:12,928 --> 00:20:13,929
What'll I do?

497
00:20:14,429 --> 00:20:14,930
Just relax.

498
00:20:15,430 --> 00:20:16,431
Take it easy...

499
00:20:16,431 --> 00:20:20,936
and in time, you may grow up to be a
nice big sofa!

500
00:20:20,936 --> 00:20:22,938
But, Officer...

501
00:20:22,938 --> 00:20:24,439
Oh, Officer!
Oh, come on, now, Lucy.

502
00:20:24,439 --> 00:20:25,941
Aw, nobody will believe me.
Come on, honey

503
00:20:25,941 --> 00:20:27,943
don't you think a good hot bath and a
nice rest

504
00:20:27,943 --> 00:20:30,445
I keep telling you what's happening
will help you relax?

505
00:20:30,445 --> 00:20:32,447
but nobody will believe me!
But, after all, Lucy...

506
00:20:32,447 --> 00:20:33,448
To arms! To arms!
To arms! To arms!

507
00:20:33,949 --> 00:20:35,450
ETHEL: What happened?
Lucy's right! Lucy's right!

508
00:20:35,951 --> 00:20:36,952
We listened through the furnace pipe.

509
00:20:36,952 --> 00:20:37,953
Yeah!
See?

510
00:20:37,953 --> 00:20:39,454
Yeah, th-they are planning to kill us

511
00:20:39,454 --> 00:20:40,455
and blow up the capital!

512
00:20:40,455 --> 00:20:41,957
Yeah, well, now, maybe you'll believe
me

513
00:20:41,957 --> 00:20:42,958
when I tell you something.

514
00:20:42,958 --> 00:20:44,459
I'm going to call the police right
away!

515
00:20:44,459 --> 00:20:46,461
I just did.
They don't care a darn about it.

516
00:20:46,461 --> 00:20:47,963
Well, they're not going to get us
without a fight.

517
00:20:47,963 --> 00:20:48,964
I'm going to get my rifle!

518
00:20:48,964 --> 00:20:50,465
Yeah, and I got two shotguns
downstairs

519
00:20:50,465 --> 00:20:51,466
and I'll get them, too.

520
00:20:51,466 --> 00:20:52,968
All right, bring both of them.

521
00:20:52,968 --> 00:20:54,970
Lock the doors and shut all the
windows!
Yeah.

522
00:20:54,970 --> 00:20:57,472
BOTH: Lock the doors and shut all the
windows.

523
00:21:07,766 --> 00:21:13,272
10:00 in the living room and all's
well!

524
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:19,778
RICKY: 10:00 in the bedroom and all's
well!

525
00:21:19,778 --> 00:21:25,784
FRED: 10:00 in the hallway and all's
well!

526
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:29,788
(Ethel mumbling): 10:00 in the
kitchen and all's well!

527
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:34,793
Kitchen sentry, report to the living
room.

528
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:42,301
Yes, sir.

529
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:44,303
Ethel, are you eating on duty?

530
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:45,304
No, sir.

531
00:21:45,804 --> 00:21:46,805
What's that in your hand?

532
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:48,307
Um...

533
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:49,808
Well, I'm not very good with a gun

534
00:21:49,808 --> 00:21:52,311
and I thought if anybody sneaked in
through the back door

535
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:53,312
I'd beat them to death.

536
00:21:54,813 --> 00:21:58,817
Well, I hope they get here before you
eat your club away.

537
00:21:58,817 --> 00:22:01,320
Hup, two, three, four.
Hup, two, three, four.

538
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:04,323
(grunting military cadence)

539
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:06,325
Fred, what are you doing away from
your post?

540
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:09,828
I'm hungry and I request transfer to
the kitchen.

541
00:22:13,799 --> 00:22:15,717
What do you want?

542
00:22:15,717 --> 00:22:18,720
I'm lonesome in there all by myself.

543
00:22:20,222 --> 00:22:21,223
(banging)

544
00:22:21,223 --> 00:22:23,225
What's that?
I hear something.

545
00:22:23,225 --> 00:22:24,226
FRED: I do, too.

546
00:22:24,226 --> 00:22:27,229
Be calm. Be calm.

547
00:22:27,229 --> 00:22:28,730
Be steady.
Take it easy.

548
00:22:28,730 --> 00:22:30,732
Don't get excited.

549
00:22:30,732 --> 00:22:34,236
Now, don't shoot till you see the
whites of their eyes.
Okay.

550
00:22:34,236 --> 00:22:35,237
Take it easy.
Okay.
Okay.

551
00:22:35,237 --> 00:22:37,239
(phone ringing)

552
00:22:45,747 --> 00:22:47,249
Hello?

553
00:22:47,749 --> 00:22:49,251
No, this isn't the city dump.

554
00:22:49,251 --> 00:22:53,255
You got the wrong number.

555
00:22:53,255 --> 00:22:54,756
Very clever ruse of theirs

556
00:22:54,756 --> 00:22:56,758
to find out if we're home or not.

557
00:22:56,758 --> 00:22:58,760
Right.
Hey, hey.

558
00:22:58,760 --> 00:22:59,761
Go around.
Come here.

559
00:22:59,761 --> 00:23:01,763
What's the matter?
Someone's at the door.

560
00:23:01,763 --> 00:23:03,765
Okay. Be careful.
Be steady.

561
00:23:03,765 --> 00:23:04,766
Be calm.
Get ready.

562
00:23:04,766 --> 00:23:06,268
Just don't be trigger-happy now.
Oh?

563
00:23:06,268 --> 00:23:08,770
Don't shoot till it's absolutely
necessary.
All right.

564
00:23:08,770 --> 00:23:10,272
All right?
Okay.
Okay.

565
00:23:10,272 --> 00:23:11,273
(doorbell buzzes)

566
00:23:31,593 --> 00:23:32,594
Good morning, folks.

567
00:23:33,095 --> 00:23:34,596
ALL: Good morning.

568
00:23:34,596 --> 00:23:35,597
(grumbles)

569
00:23:35,597 --> 00:23:38,600
Well, I finally got this thing
straightened out.

570
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:40,102
You have?
You did?
What?

571
00:23:40,102 --> 00:23:41,103
Great.
Yeah.

572
00:23:41,103 --> 00:23:42,604
The O'Briens are actors.

573
00:23:42,604 --> 00:23:45,607
What you heard was a play they were
rehearsing.

574
00:23:45,607 --> 00:23:48,110
Eww!

575
00:23:51,113 --> 00:23:53,115
You can go now.

576
00:23:56,618 --> 00:23:57,119
Mr. Mertz.

577
00:23:57,619 --> 00:23:58,120
Yeah?

578
00:23:58,620 --> 00:24:00,122
The O'Briens told me to tell you

579
00:24:00,122 --> 00:24:02,124
they're moving out of your apartment.

580
00:24:02,124 --> 00:24:03,625
Aw... fine.

581
00:24:03,625 --> 00:24:05,627
This is all your fault, Lucy.

582
00:24:06,128 --> 00:24:08,630
FRED: Yes, and you'll pay that rent
till we get another tenant.

583
00:24:08,630 --> 00:24:11,133
And one of your trigger-happy
sentinels

584
00:24:11,133 --> 00:24:13,135
shot a hole in the hot water pipe.

585
00:24:13,135 --> 00:24:15,137
Your whole apartment is flooded.

586
00:24:15,637 --> 00:24:17,139
And she'll pay for that, too!

587
00:24:19,057 --> 00:24:21,560
Oh, come on, Fred, we better hurry
home.

588
00:24:25,063 --> 00:24:28,066
Uh, you must be the famous, uh, Ricky
Ricardo.

589
00:24:28,066 --> 00:24:30,068
Oh, you heard about me, eh?

590
00:24:30,068 --> 00:24:32,070
In the paper...
this morning.

591
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:34,573
Oh, in the paper.

592
00:24:34,573 --> 00:24:36,074

"Orchestra Leader...
Jailed in Shooting Spree."

594
00:24:42,581 --> 00:24:43,582
Cuando la lleve a la casa

595
00:24:43,582 --> 00:24:45,584
le voy a cortar la cabeza en dos
pedazos.

596
00:24:45,584 --> 00:24:47,085
Come on, sweetheart.
Come on.

597
00:24:47,085 --> 00:24:48,587
Come on, sweetheart.

598
00:24:48,587 --> 00:24:49,588
Let's go home.

599
00:24:49,588 --> 00:24:51,590
Come on, lady, you can go out in the
world now.

600
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:53,091
Nobody's going to kill you.

601
00:24:53,091 --> 00:24:55,093
Come on, sweetheart.
Come on.

602
00:24:55,093 --> 00:24:58,597
Come on, sweetheart.

603
00:24:58,597 --> 00:25:00,098
Lock the door, Officer.

604
00:25:00,098 --> 00:25:02,100
I like it better in here.

605
00:25:11,009 --> 00:25:13,979

Hi.

6
00:00:39,355 --> 00:00:40,857
Hi, Lucy.
Hi, Lucy.
You ready?

7
00:00:40,857 --> 00:00:41,858
Hi, Rick.
Yeah, almost.

8
00:00:41,858 --> 00:00:43,359
Come on, Ricky, get your coat, honey.

9
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:44,861
Picture starts at 8:22.

10
00:00:44,861 --> 00:00:47,864
Oh, honey, I-I think you better go
alone.

11
00:00:47,864 --> 00:00:49,866
I'm having nothing but problems with
my new show.

12
00:00:49,866 --> 00:00:52,368
Oh, Ricky, what kind of problems?

13
00:00:52,368 --> 00:00:54,871
Well... it's a cavalcade of show
business we're doing

14
00:00:55,371 --> 00:00:57,373
and I'm-I'm having trouble finding
some acts.

15
00:00:57,373 --> 00:01:00,877
Oh, what kind of acts do you need,
Ricky?

16
00:01:00,877 --> 00:01:02,879
What kind of acts do you need?

17
00:01:03,379 --> 00:01:04,380
Now, look, Lucy

18
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:07,884
we're not going to go all over this
again.

19
00:01:07,884 --> 00:01:09,886
You cannot be in the show.

20
00:01:09,886 --> 00:01:11,888
Give me one good reason.

21
00:01:11,888 --> 00:01:13,890
You have no talent.

22
00:01:15,892 --> 00:01:17,393
Give me another good reason.

23
00:01:17,393 --> 00:01:18,394
Ay-ay-ay-ay-ay.

24
00:01:18,394 --> 00:01:20,897
Look, honey, even if I wanted to put
you in the show

25
00:01:20,897 --> 00:01:22,398
I wouldn't be able to do it.

26
00:01:22,398 --> 00:01:23,399
There's only two openings--

27
00:01:23,399 --> 00:01:25,902
a ballet dancer and a pair of
burlesque comics.

28
00:01:25,902 --> 00:01:27,904
I'm a ballet dancer.

29
00:01:27,904 --> 00:01:30,907
Well, I am, and I've had...
I've had experience, too.

30
00:01:30,907 --> 00:01:33,409
I-I-I was in a dance recital in high
school--

31
00:01:33,409 --> 00:01:34,911
"The Dance of the Flowers."

32
00:01:34,911 --> 00:01:36,913
She has got nice stems.

33
00:01:37,413 --> 00:01:38,414
LUCY: Thank you.

00:01:40,917 --> 00:01:43,920
I was the only petunia that did a
solo.

35
00:01:46,422 --> 00:01:48,424
Look, Petunia, Madame Lamand--

36
00:01:48,424 --> 00:01:51,427
the premier ballerina of the French
Ballet--

37
00:01:51,427 --> 00:01:52,929
is staging this number.

38
00:01:52,929 --> 00:01:56,432
I hardly think that she would
consider that training enough.

39
00:01:56,432 --> 00:01:58,434
Well, then she'll just have to be
shown.

40
00:01:58,434 --> 00:02:00,937
I just happen to have that costume in
my trunk

41
00:02:00,937 --> 00:02:02,939
and I know that I can do that dance

42
00:02:02,939 --> 00:02:04,440
just as well now as I did then.

43
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:06,943
Once you really know ballet, it never
leaves you.

44
00:02:06,943 --> 00:02:09,445
Lucy, I didn't know you were a ballet
dancer.

45
00:02:09,445 --> 00:02:12,448
For four years, I was never off my
toes.

46
00:02:15,952 --> 00:02:17,954
What am I going to do about her?

47
00:02:17,954 --> 00:02:20,456
Have you ever thought of putting her
in a large basket

48
00:02:20,456 --> 00:02:22,458
and leaving her on somebody's
doorstep?

49
00:02:24,961 --> 00:02:27,463
(chuckling): No, that wouldn't work.

50
00:02:27,463 --> 00:02:30,466
She's too smart; she'd find her way
home.

51
00:02:30,466 --> 00:02:31,968
Hey, Rick...
(clears throat)

52
00:02:31,968 --> 00:02:33,970
You know those comedians you want--

53
00:02:33,970 --> 00:02:37,473
do they... do they really have to be,
uh, burlesque comics?

54
00:02:37,473 --> 00:02:39,976
You know, I did a very funny act
years ago

55
00:02:39,976 --> 00:02:41,477
with my partner, Ted Kertz.

56
00:02:41,477 --> 00:02:43,479
Mertz and Kertz, the laugh twins.

57
00:02:43,479 --> 00:02:44,981
Ay-ay-ay-ay-ay.

58
00:02:44,981 --> 00:02:45,982
Presenting Mertz and Kertz.

59
00:02:46,482 --> 00:02:49,485
Well, if I ain't my ol...
if it ain't my old friend, Fred.

60
00:02:49,485 --> 00:02:50,486
How are you, Fred?

61
00:02:50,486 --> 00:02:51,988
Well, if it ain't my old friend, Ted.

62
00:02:51,988 --> 00:02:52,989
How are you, Ted?

63
00:02:52,989 --> 00:02:54,991
Did you hear about the terrible
accident

64
00:02:54,991 --> 00:02:55,992
on the streetcar, Freddy?

65
00:02:55,992 --> 00:02:57,493
No, I didn't hear about an accident

66
00:02:57,493 --> 00:02:58,494
on the streetcar, Teddy.

67
00:02:58,494 --> 00:03:00,496
You mean to tell me you didn't hear

68
00:03:00,496 --> 00:03:02,999
about the accident on the streetcar,
Teddy?

69
00:03:02,999 --> 00:03:04,000
Mertz...

70
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,502
I'm Kertz.

71
00:03:06,502 --> 00:03:08,004
Now I'm Mertz.

72
00:03:08,004 --> 00:03:09,505
How are you, Rick?

73
00:03:09,505 --> 00:03:12,508
They have to be burlesque comics.

74
00:03:12,508 --> 00:03:14,510
Aw, pshaw, that's too bad.

75
00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:16,012
Hey, by the way

76
00:03:16,012 --> 00:03:18,014
what was the terrible accident on the
streetcar?

77
00:03:18,514 --> 00:03:19,015
(laughing)

78
00:03:19,515 --> 00:03:21,017
Wouldn't you like to know?

79
00:03:22,518 --> 00:03:24,020
No.

80
00:03:25,521 --> 00:03:27,023
Well, I'll tell you anyway

81
00:03:27,023 --> 00:03:28,524
but remember, this is my best gag

82
00:03:28,524 --> 00:03:30,526
and you got to promise not to use it.

83
00:03:31,027 --> 00:03:32,528
Okay, I promise.

84
00:03:32,528 --> 00:03:35,531
What was the terrible accident on the
streetcar, Fred?

85
00:03:35,531 --> 00:03:37,533
Well, a man had his eye on a seat

86
00:03:37,533 --> 00:03:39,035
and a woman sat on it.

87
00:03:39,035 --> 00:03:41,037
(laughing)

88
00:03:41,037 --> 00:03:43,039
What a pip-a-roo!

89
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:46,542
Remember now, you promised not to use
it.

90
00:03:46,542 --> 00:03:49,545
That's one promise I will never
break.

91
00:03:49,545 --> 00:03:53,132
Introducing Petunia Ricardo.

92
00:03:55,635 --> 00:03:57,136
(music)

93
00:03:57,136 --> 00:04:01,641
(piano playing "Dance of the
Sugarplum Fairies")

94
00:04:20,159 --> 00:04:22,161
(music ends)

95
00:04:25,665 --> 00:04:27,667
Well?

96
00:04:27,667 --> 00:04:29,168
Well, you'll do for the comic

97
00:04:29,168 --> 00:04:31,671
but who am I going to get for the
ballet dancer?

98
00:04:31,671 --> 00:04:34,674
Oh, Ricky, you're mean.

99
00:04:34,674 --> 00:04:38,177
Look, honey, you're not serious about
this, are you?

100
00:04:38,177 --> 00:04:39,679
I am, too.

101
00:04:39,679 --> 00:04:41,180
Here I am with all this talent

102
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:42,682
bottled up inside of me

103
00:04:42,682 --> 00:04:45,184
and you're always sitting on the
cork.

104
00:04:45,184 --> 00:04:46,686
Now, Lucy.

105
00:04:46,686 --> 00:04:49,188
I'm gonna get in that show if it's
the last thing I do.

106
00:04:49,188 --> 00:04:51,691
Lucy, you're too young to die.

107
00:04:51,691 --> 00:04:53,693
Whose side are you on?

108
00:04:53,693 --> 00:04:55,194
ETHEL: Well...

109
00:04:55,194 --> 00:04:58,197
I'm going to get in that show or my
name isn't Lucy Ricardo.

110
00:04:58,197 --> 00:05:00,700
What did you say, Clem?

111
00:05:02,702 --> 00:05:04,203
Oh!

112
00:05:13,096 --> 00:05:14,097
(laughing): Touche.

113
00:05:14,097 --> 00:05:15,598
En garde!

114
00:05:15,598 --> 00:05:17,600
I have just had a most exciting visit

115
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,103
with the wife of Monsieur Ricardo.

116
00:05:20,103 --> 00:05:22,105
She is a very experienced dancer

117
00:05:22,105 --> 00:05:24,607
and she will be your partner.

118
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:26,609
She is here now.

119
00:05:26,609 --> 00:05:28,111
Come in, Madame Ricardo.

120
00:05:28,111 --> 00:05:30,113
Entrez, entrez, entrez.

121
00:05:30,113 --> 00:05:31,614
Come in, come in.

122
00:05:38,621 --> 00:05:42,625
Mesdames et messieurs, Madame
Ricardo.

123
00:05:44,127 --> 00:05:47,130
Kiss the hand, Enchante, N'est-ce
pas?

124
00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:49,132
Now, first I think we will start

125
00:05:49,632 --> 00:05:51,634
with a few limbering-up exercises.

126
00:05:51,634 --> 00:05:54,137
I assume you know all the basic
positions.

127
00:05:54,137 --> 00:05:56,139
Uh, yeah, yeah.

128
00:05:56,139 --> 00:05:58,141
All right, Ici, madame, ici.

129
00:05:58,141 --> 00:06:00,643
Classe, en place.

130
00:06:00,643 --> 00:06:03,646
All righty, class.

131
00:06:03,646 --> 00:06:06,649
Now then, first position.

132
00:06:06,649 --> 00:06:09,152
Bon, bon.

133
00:06:09,152 --> 00:06:11,154
No, madame, further out.

134
00:06:12,155 --> 00:06:15,158
No, madame, the toes...
further out.

135
00:06:24,667 --> 00:06:28,171
Madame, not that far out.

136
00:06:28,171 --> 00:06:30,673
Now then, a plie.

137
00:06:30,673 --> 00:06:33,176
And a one, a two, a three, a four

138
00:06:33,176 --> 00:06:35,678
a five, a six, a seven, eight.

139
00:06:35,678 --> 00:06:39,682
A one, a two, a three, a four, a
five...

140
00:06:39,682 --> 00:06:41,184
Stop, stop, stop.

141
00:06:41,184 --> 00:06:43,186
Stop!

142
00:06:45,688 --> 00:06:47,190
Fifth position.

143
00:06:58,201 --> 00:07:00,203
Now then...

144
00:07:01,204 --> 00:07:02,205
Plie.

145
00:07:02,205 --> 00:07:04,707
And a one, a two, a three, a four

146
00:07:04,707 --> 00:07:07,210
a five, a six, a seven, eight.

147
00:07:07,210 --> 00:07:08,211
A one...

148
00:07:19,722 --> 00:07:22,225
Tres bien, classe.

149
00:07:22,225 --> 00:07:24,727
Petite battement.

150
00:07:24,727 --> 00:07:27,230
And a one, a two, a three, a change.

151
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:29,232
A one, a two, a three, a change.

152
00:07:29,232 --> 00:07:31,234
A one, a two, a three, a change.

153
00:07:31,234 --> 00:07:32,735
A one, a two, a three, a change.

154
00:07:32,735 --> 00:07:34,737
One, a two, a three, a change.

155
00:07:34,737 --> 00:07:36,739
One, a two, a three, a change.

156
00:07:36,739 --> 00:07:38,741
One, a two, a three, a change.

157
00:07:38,741 --> 00:07:39,742
a one, a two...

158
00:07:39,742 --> 00:07:41,744
(taps floor with cane)

159
00:07:41,744 --> 00:07:43,246
Un moment, un moment.

160
00:07:45,748 --> 00:07:47,750
Releve.

161
00:07:48,751 --> 00:07:51,254
Tour en l'air.

162
00:07:51,254 --> 00:07:53,256
A one, a two, a three, a four

163
00:07:53,256 --> 00:07:55,758
a five, a six, a seven, eight.

164
00:07:55,758 --> 00:07:57,260
A one, a two, a three, a four

165
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:59,262
a five, a six, a seven, eight.

166
00:07:59,262 --> 00:08:01,764
A one, a two, a three, a four...

167
00:08:01,764 --> 00:08:03,266
Enough! Enough!

168
00:08:04,767 --> 00:08:06,769
Take a rest period!

169
00:08:07,770 --> 00:08:10,773
Except Madame Ricardo.

170
00:08:13,276 --> 00:08:14,777
Madame Ricardo, I am afraid

171
00:08:14,777 --> 00:08:16,279
you have not quite had

172
00:08:16,279 --> 00:08:18,281
the experience I had hoped for.

173
00:08:18,281 --> 00:08:20,283
Well, I guess I am a little rusty.

174
00:08:20,283 --> 00:08:22,785
I think we should go to the barre.

175
00:08:22,785 --> 00:08:25,788
Oh, good, because I'm awful thirsty.

176
00:08:25,788 --> 00:08:27,290
Madame...

177
00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:29,292
This barre.

178
00:08:29,292 --> 00:08:31,794
Oh, I thought you meant...

179
00:08:33,296 --> 00:08:35,298
Take your place at the barre.

180
00:08:35,298 --> 00:08:37,800
Feet in first position.

181
00:08:38,301 --> 00:08:39,302
Now, in the first place

182
00:08:39,302 --> 00:08:41,304
your posture is atrocious.

183
00:08:41,304 --> 00:08:43,806
Shoulders back, hips under

184
00:08:43,806 --> 00:08:46,309
stomach in, chest out

185
00:08:46,309 --> 00:08:48,311
chin up, knees straight.

186
00:08:48,811 --> 00:08:51,814
Now then, remembering all these
things

187
00:08:51,814 --> 00:08:55,318
raise the right leg even with the
barre.

188
00:09:06,829 --> 00:09:08,331
Even with the barre?

189
00:09:08,331 --> 00:09:09,332
Even with the barre.

190
00:09:20,343 --> 00:09:23,346
Now then, lower the leg

191
00:09:23,346 --> 00:09:25,848
slowly to the floor.

192
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:40,863
Madame, the leg down, a bas.

193
00:09:41,364 --> 00:09:41,864
A bas!

194
00:09:42,365 --> 00:09:43,366
A bas.

195
00:09:43,366 --> 00:09:44,367
A bas.

196
00:09:44,367 --> 00:09:47,370
A bas! A bas!

197
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:48,371
A bas!

198
00:09:48,371 --> 00:09:50,373
A bas.

199
00:09:50,373 --> 00:09:52,375
A bas, a bas.

200
00:09:52,375 --> 00:09:54,877
A bas.

201
00:09:54,877 --> 00:09:58,381
A-a-a bas!

202
00:09:58,381 --> 00:09:59,882
A bas.

203
00:09:59,882 --> 00:10:01,384
A bas.

204
00:10:01,384 --> 00:10:02,885
A bas.

205
00:10:02,885 --> 00:10:03,886
A bas.

206
00:10:03,886 --> 00:10:05,888
A bas.

207
00:10:05,888 --> 00:10:06,889
A bas.

208
00:10:06,889 --> 00:10:08,391
A bas.

209
00:10:09,892 --> 00:10:11,394
A bas!

210
00:10:11,394 --> 00:10:13,896
A bas.

211
00:10:13,896 --> 00:10:15,898
A bas.

212
00:10:18,901 --> 00:10:20,403
Where are you going?

213
00:10:21,904 --> 00:10:24,907
No, no, no, no, there is much work to
do.

214
00:10:26,409 --> 00:10:27,410
There is?

215
00:10:27,410 --> 00:10:29,412
Oui, you have great talent.

216
00:10:29,412 --> 00:10:30,913
I have?

217
00:10:30,913 --> 00:10:32,415
But there is much to do

218
00:10:32,415 --> 00:10:34,917
to get you in shape for the opening.

219
00:10:34,917 --> 00:10:36,419
Now then, at the barre

220
00:10:36,419 --> 00:10:37,920
feet in first position.

221
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,922
Shoulders back, hips under

222
00:10:39,922 --> 00:10:41,424
stomach in, chest out

223
00:10:41,424 --> 00:10:43,426
chin up, knees straight.

224
00:10:43,426 --> 00:10:44,427
Now then, plie.

225
00:10:50,933 --> 00:10:53,936
500 times!

226
00:10:56,939 --> 00:11:00,443
And a one, a two, a three, a four

227
00:11:00,443 --> 00:11:03,946
a five, a six, a seven, eight...

228
00:11:11,637 --> 00:11:15,041
(phone rings)

229
00:11:22,048 --> 00:11:23,049
Hello.

230
00:11:23,049 --> 00:11:24,550
Hello, Lucy.
How are you feeling today?

231
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:25,551
Can you move yet?

232
00:11:25,551 --> 00:11:27,553
Oh, yeah, I'm fine.
As a matter of fact

233
00:11:27,553 --> 00:11:29,555
I'm expecting my partner here any
minute.

234
00:11:29,555 --> 00:11:32,058
Your partner?
I thought you gave up ballet.

235
00:11:32,058 --> 00:11:33,559
Oh, I did; that was too much work.

236
00:11:33,559 --> 00:11:35,061
No, I called the Lido Theater and
asked them

237
00:11:35,061 --> 00:11:37,063
to send over a comic to teach me a
burlesque act.

238
00:11:37,563 --> 00:11:40,066
(doorbell buzzes)
Oh, somebody's at the door; maybe
that's him.

239
00:11:40,066 --> 00:11:41,567
I'll call you back later, Ethel.

240
00:11:45,071 --> 00:11:48,074
Well, this must be the place.

241
00:11:48,574 --> 00:11:52,578
(whistles)

242
00:11:53,079 --> 00:11:54,580
Well, what time do the girls get
here?

243
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:56,582
Uh, how do you do?
I'm Mrs. Ricardo.

244
00:11:56,582 --> 00:11:58,084
Oh, how do you do?
Where's the fella

245
00:11:58,084 --> 00:12:00,086
who wants me to teach him a bit?

246
00:12:00,086 --> 00:12:01,087
Oh, right here.

247
00:12:01,087 --> 00:12:03,589
Say, you're a nice-looking fella.

248
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:06,092
Thank you. You see, I have a
wonderful chance

249
00:12:06,092 --> 00:12:08,094
to get into a show if I can do a
burlesque act.

250
00:12:08,094 --> 00:12:10,596
Oh, I don't know about doing this bit
with a dame.

251
00:12:10,596 --> 00:12:12,598
These bit-bits are done by two men.

252
00:12:12,598 --> 00:12:15,101
Well, couldn't you just pretend that
I'm a man?

253
00:12:15,101 --> 00:12:17,603
Okay, I got a good imagination.

254
00:12:17,603 --> 00:12:19,105
Come here.

255
00:12:19,105 --> 00:12:20,106
Here, this will help.

256
00:12:20,606 --> 00:12:21,607
Try it on.

257
00:12:21,607 --> 00:12:23,109
Okay.

258
00:12:28,614 --> 00:12:29,615
Now, let's see.

259
00:12:29,615 --> 00:12:31,117
What bit will we do?

260
00:12:31,117 --> 00:12:33,119
How about "Slowly I turn"?

261
00:12:33,119 --> 00:12:34,120
Slowly I turn?

262
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,121
What's that?

263
00:12:35,121 --> 00:12:37,123
That's the name of the sketch.

264
00:12:37,123 --> 00:12:38,124
Oh.
Want to try it?

265
00:12:38,124 --> 00:12:39,125
All right.

266
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:40,626
There isn't much to it.

267
00:12:40,626 --> 00:12:41,627
What do I do?

268
00:12:41,627 --> 00:12:43,629
Well, I'll be sitting here on this
park bench here.

269
00:12:43,629 --> 00:12:46,132
You come along, tell me I look down
in the mouth.

270
00:12:46,132 --> 00:12:47,633
Ask me if you can help.

271
00:12:47,633 --> 00:12:49,135
Yeah, well, what happens then?

272
00:12:49,135 --> 00:12:51,637
Well, the rest of it sort of takes
care of itself.

273
00:12:51,637 --> 00:12:53,139
Okay.
Want to try it?

274
00:12:53,139 --> 00:12:54,640
Yeah.

275
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,142
Uh, you look down in the mouth.

276
00:12:56,142 --> 00:12:57,143
Can I help you?

277
00:12:57,643 --> 00:12:59,645
Stranger, you have a kind face.

278
00:12:59,645 --> 00:13:01,647
Would you like to hear my story?

279
00:13:01,647 --> 00:13:03,149
Say, "Yeah."

280
00:13:03,149 --> 00:13:04,150
Yeah.

281
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:05,651
Okay.

282
00:13:05,651 --> 00:13:07,653
I wasn't always a bum.

283
00:13:07,653 --> 00:13:10,156
Once I was handsome like you.

284
00:13:10,156 --> 00:13:12,158
Then she came into my life.

285
00:13:12,158 --> 00:13:14,660
It was love at first sight.

286
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:16,162
And we were married

287
00:13:16,162 --> 00:13:18,164
and very happy

288
00:13:18,164 --> 00:13:21,667
until one night, there came a knock
at the door.

289
00:13:21,667 --> 00:13:23,669
I opened it.

290
00:13:23,669 --> 00:13:25,171
A stranger was there.

291
00:13:25,171 --> 00:13:28,674
I vowed to make my home his home.

292
00:13:28,674 --> 00:13:31,677
And that was the beginning of the
end.

293
00:13:31,677 --> 00:13:35,181
One night when I returned home from
work

294
00:13:35,181 --> 00:13:36,682
I found the usual note.

295
00:13:36,682 --> 00:13:39,185
The stranger had stolen my wife away.

296
00:13:40,186 --> 00:13:42,688
Then the search began.

297
00:13:42,688 --> 00:13:45,691
I followed them all over the world

298
00:13:45,691 --> 00:13:49,195
Until one day I saw them at Niagara
Falls--

299
00:13:49,195 --> 00:13:52,198
that beast and my lovely wife.

300
00:13:52,198 --> 00:13:56,202
I never mention her name because when
I do

301
00:13:56,202 --> 00:13:59,705
everything turns black in front of
me.

302
00:13:59,705 --> 00:14:03,709
I'm possessed with a lust to kill.

303
00:14:03,709 --> 00:14:06,212
That's why I never mention her name.

304
00:14:06,212 --> 00:14:08,714
But it's the same as George
Washington's wife.

305
00:14:08,714 --> 00:14:10,216
Martha?

306
00:14:10,216 --> 00:14:13,219
Martha... that's it, Martha.

307
00:14:13,219 --> 00:14:16,222
Slowly I turned

308
00:14:16,222 --> 00:14:18,724
step by step, inch by inch

309
00:14:18,724 --> 00:14:20,726
I crept up on the beast

310
00:14:20,726 --> 00:14:22,228
who had ruined my life.

311
00:14:22,228 --> 00:14:24,230
I looked around for a rock.

312
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:26,232
I grab one, I let him have it.

313
00:14:26,232 --> 00:14:29,735
Revenge was all I had on my mind.
(screaming)

314
00:14:29,735 --> 00:14:30,736
Stop it! Stop it!

315
00:14:30,736 --> 00:14:31,737
Stop it!

316
00:14:31,737 --> 00:14:33,739
What's the matter with you?

317
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:36,742
Oh.

318
00:14:36,742 --> 00:14:38,244
Oh, you're not him.

319
00:14:38,244 --> 00:14:39,245
No!

320
00:14:39,245 --> 00:14:41,247
You're the one with the kind face.

321
00:14:41,247 --> 00:14:43,249
Yeah!

322
00:14:43,249 --> 00:14:44,750
I'm sorry.

323
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:46,252
I'm not well.

324
00:14:46,252 --> 00:14:48,754
Well, that's all right, I understand.

325
00:14:48,754 --> 00:14:52,174
I guess it might have been quite a
shock to you thinking

326
00:14:52,174 --> 00:14:53,175
about Martha.

327
00:14:53,175 --> 00:14:54,176
Martha!

328
00:14:54,176 --> 00:14:55,678
Martha!

329
00:14:55,678 --> 00:14:57,680
Slowly I turned

330
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,682
step by step

331
00:14:59,682 --> 00:15:01,183
inch by inch, I crept up on him.

332
00:15:01,183 --> 00:15:02,685
I looked around for another rock.

333
00:15:02,685 --> 00:15:03,686
I grab it.

334
00:15:03,686 --> 00:15:05,187
I let him have it once more.

335
00:15:05,187 --> 00:15:06,689
Revenge, that's all I wanted.

336
00:15:06,689 --> 00:15:08,691
Stop! Stop it!

337
00:15:08,691 --> 00:15:10,192
Give me that thing.

338
00:15:10,192 --> 00:15:12,194
What's the matter with you?
Don't you remember me?

339
00:15:12,695 --> 00:15:14,196
Oh, it's you.

340
00:15:14,196 --> 00:15:16,198
Yeah, the one with the kind face.

341
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:20,202
I'm sorry.

342
00:15:20,202 --> 00:15:21,704
I'm very weak.

343
00:15:21,704 --> 00:15:24,206
I should have met you when I was
stronger.

344
00:15:24,206 --> 00:15:28,210
Yeah, you should have met me before
you met Ma... Oh.

345
00:15:30,212 --> 00:15:32,214
I almost said "Martha."

346
00:15:33,716 --> 00:15:36,719
Slowly I turned

347
00:15:36,719 --> 00:15:38,220
step by step, inch by inch.

348
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:40,222
I looked around for a rock.

349
00:15:40,222 --> 00:15:41,223
I couldn't find one.

350
00:15:41,223 --> 00:15:43,726
So, I grabbed a handful of Niagara
Falls

351
00:15:43,726 --> 00:15:45,227
and I let him have it.

352
00:15:53,235 --> 00:15:54,737
Give me that thing.

353
00:15:54,737 --> 00:15:56,739
That's enough of this.

354
00:15:56,739 --> 00:15:57,740
I agree with you.

355
00:15:57,740 --> 00:15:58,741
It's too much.

356
00:15:58,741 --> 00:16:00,242
I'm ashamed of myself.

357
00:16:00,242 --> 00:16:01,243
Well, you ought to be.

358
00:16:01,243 --> 00:16:02,745
Look at me, I'm a mess.

359
00:16:02,745 --> 00:16:05,247
That's a very strange way to react

360
00:16:05,247 --> 00:16:07,750
just because you hear the name
Martha.

361
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:10,753
Martha! Slowly I turned

362
00:16:10,753 --> 00:16:13,756
step by step, inch by inch

363
00:16:13,756 --> 00:16:15,257
I crept up on him.

364
00:16:15,257 --> 00:16:16,258
I let him have it.

365
00:16:16,258 --> 00:16:17,760
I let him...
Drop it! Drop it!

366
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:19,261
Drop it! Drop it!

367
00:16:19,261 --> 00:16:20,262
On the floor?

368
00:16:20,262 --> 00:16:21,764
No, let me have it.

369
00:16:21,764 --> 00:16:23,265
Okay.

370
00:16:39,782 --> 00:16:41,784
What's the matter with you?

371
00:16:41,784 --> 00:16:43,285
Are you crazy or something?

372
00:16:43,285 --> 00:16:44,787
You said to let you have it.

373
00:16:44,787 --> 00:16:46,288
Oh!

374
00:16:46,288 --> 00:16:47,289
Oh, you gotta...

375
00:16:47,289 --> 00:16:48,290
You're a pretty good sport.

376
00:16:48,290 --> 00:16:49,291
Here.

377
00:16:49,291 --> 00:16:51,293
Now that you got the idea of the bit

378
00:16:51,293 --> 00:16:52,294
you want to try it again?

379
00:16:52,294 --> 00:16:55,297
Yeah, but this time, you be the one

380
00:16:55,297 --> 00:16:56,799
with the kind face.

381
00:16:56,799 --> 00:16:58,300
Okay.

382
00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:00,302
(phone rings)

383
00:17:03,305 --> 00:17:04,306
Hello.

384
00:17:04,306 --> 00:17:06,308
Hello, Lucy, Fred just called me

385
00:17:06,308 --> 00:17:09,812
and I think I ought to tell you
before you get too involved

386
00:17:09,812 --> 00:17:11,814
Ricky hired those burlesque comics.

387
00:17:11,814 --> 00:17:14,316
Ew...

388
00:17:21,023 --> 00:17:25,527
(Latin dance music playing)

389
00:17:59,561 --> 00:18:01,563
Well, some opening night, huh?

390
00:18:01,563 --> 00:18:02,564
Yes.

391
00:18:02,564 --> 00:18:04,066
Too bad Lucy was so stubborn.

392
00:18:04,066 --> 00:18:05,567
She wouldn't even come down.

393
00:18:05,567 --> 00:18:06,568
Did you see Ricky?

394
00:18:06,568 --> 00:18:08,070
Yeah, but he couldn't talk to me.

395
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:09,071
Something went wrong backstage.

396
00:18:09,071 --> 00:18:11,573
One of the ballet dancers took sick,
and they don't know

397
00:18:11,573 --> 00:18:13,075
what they're going to do about the
number.

398
00:18:13,575 --> 00:18:14,576
Lucy knows that routine.

399
00:18:14,576 --> 00:18:17,079
She learned it from Madame Lamand.

400
00:18:17,079 --> 00:18:19,081
Gee, that would be a great break for
her.

401
00:18:19,081 --> 00:18:21,583
Yeah.
But what a terrible trick to play on
Ricky.

402
00:18:21,583 --> 00:18:22,584
It is not.

403
00:18:22,584 --> 00:18:24,086
She'll be fine.

404
00:18:24,086 --> 00:18:25,587
I'm going to call her up

405
00:18:25,587 --> 00:18:27,589
and tell her to come right now.

406
00:18:27,589 --> 00:18:28,590
You go find Ricky

407
00:18:28,590 --> 00:18:30,592
and tell him you've got another
dancer.

408
00:18:31,093 --> 00:18:32,094
All right.

409
00:18:36,682 --> 00:18:39,184
(phone rings)

410
00:18:39,184 --> 00:18:40,686
Hello.

411
00:18:40,686 --> 00:18:42,688
Hello, Lucy, this is Ethel.
I'm down at the club.

412
00:18:42,688 --> 00:18:44,189
Yeah.

413
00:18:44,189 --> 00:18:45,691
The most exciting thing just
happened.

414
00:18:45,691 --> 00:18:46,692
One of the performers just got sick

415
00:18:47,192 --> 00:18:48,193
and can't do the act

416
00:18:48,193 --> 00:18:50,195
and you're the only one that knows
the routine.

417
00:18:50,195 --> 00:18:51,697
Routine?
You mean "Slowly I Turn"?

418
00:18:51,697 --> 00:18:53,198
Yeah, all that turning stuff.

419
00:18:53,198 --> 00:18:54,700
You learned it that day, didn't you?

420
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:56,702
I'll say.
Uh, what about my partner?

421
00:18:56,702 --> 00:18:57,703
Oh, he's here.

422
00:18:57,703 --> 00:18:59,705
Okay, I'll get my costume on, and
I'll be right down.

423
00:18:59,705 --> 00:19:01,707
Well, hurry up. You'll just have time
to make it.

424
00:19:01,707 --> 00:19:03,208
Okay.

425
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:10,833
(playing song intro)

426
00:19:22,845 --> 00:19:28,851
Linda flor de alborada

427
00:19:28,851 --> 00:19:33,856
Te brotaste del suelo

428
00:19:33,856 --> 00:19:39,361
Cuando la luz del cielo

429
00:19:39,361 --> 00:19:45,367
Tu capullo besaba

430
00:19:45,367 --> 00:19:50,372
De la rosa y el encanto

431
00:19:50,372 --> 00:19:57,880
El penso que te ama tanto

432
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:04,386
Que ya loco de amor siente celos de
la vez

433
00:20:04,386 --> 00:20:12,394
Del aire, del sol.

434
00:20:15,898 --> 00:20:24,907
Marta, capullito de rosa

435
00:20:24,907 --> 00:20:33,415
Marta, del jardin linda flor

436
00:20:33,415 --> 00:20:40,422
Dime que feliz mariposa

437
00:20:40,422 --> 00:20:44,927
En tu caricia pulsa

438
00:20:44,927 --> 00:20:50,432
Arriata del sol

439
00:20:50,432 --> 00:20:58,941
Marta, que en tus claras pupilas

440
00:20:58,941 --> 00:21:06,949
Brilla una aurora de amor

441
00:21:07,449 --> 00:21:19,461
Marta, que en tus ojos azules

442
00:21:19,962 --> 00:21:23,465
De infatigable candor

443
00:21:23,966 --> 00:21:32,975
De buen huellos, adios.

444
00:22:47,549 --> 00:22:55,557
Martha, rambling rose in the wildwood

445
00:22:55,557 --> 00:23:02,564
Martha, with a fragrance divine

446
00:23:02,564 --> 00:23:09,071
Rosebud of the days of my childhood

447
00:23:09,071 --> 00:23:12,574
Watch you bloom in the wildwood

448
00:23:12,574 --> 00:23:17,579
And I hope you'll be mine

449
00:23:17,579 --> 00:23:25,087
Martha, now your eyes beam at
twilight

450
00:23:25,087 --> 00:23:32,094
Sparkling like the dew from a dawn

451
00:23:32,094 --> 00:23:38,600
Martha, well, I live for your
love-light

452
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:42,104
I awake with a sigh

453
00:23:42,104 --> 00:23:51,613
And I find you are gone

454
00:23:51,613 --> 00:23:59,621
Martha, Martha, Martha.

455
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:17,322
Ricky?

456
00:24:17,322 --> 00:24:19,324
Ricky?

457
00:24:19,324 --> 00:24:20,826
Well, hello, honey.

458
00:24:20,826 --> 00:24:22,327
It's about time you got home.

459
00:24:22,327 --> 00:24:23,328
Come in, dear.

460
00:24:23,829 --> 00:24:25,831
Are you mad at me, honey?

461
00:24:25,831 --> 00:24:27,833
Why, of course not, honey.

462
00:24:27,833 --> 00:24:29,701
Are you sure?

463
00:24:29,701 --> 00:24:30,635
Positive.

464
00:24:30,635 --> 00:24:31,636
Come in, honey.

465
00:24:46,501 --> 00:24:48,503
Ricky Ricardo!

466
00:24:50,505 --> 00:24:54,009
Well, I guess I had it coming to me.

467
00:25:00,515 --> 00:25:02,017
Now we're even.

468
00:25:02,017 --> 00:25:03,518
Yeah.

469
00:25:07,272 --> 00:25:09,174

Oops!

4
00:00:48,915 --> 00:00:50,417
Guess who it is.

5
00:00:50,917 --> 00:00:52,419
Bill?

00:00:52,919 --> 00:00:53,920
Sam?

Pat?

00:00:54,921 --> 00:00:56,423
No!

00:00:56,423 --> 00:00:57,924
Pedro.

00:00:57,924 --> 00:00:59,426
Pablo.

11
00:00:59,426 --> 00:01:00,927
Jose.

12
00:01:00,927 --> 00:01:01,928
No, it's me.

13
00:01:01,928 --> 00:01:04,931
Oh, yes, of course, um...

14
00:01:06,433 --> 00:01:07,934
Very, very funny.

15
00:01:07,934 --> 00:01:08,935
Hi.

16
00:01:08,935 --> 00:01:09,936
Hi.

17
00:01:09,936 --> 00:01:11,438
Hey, company for dinner?

18
00:01:11,438 --> 00:01:12,439
Uh-huh.

19
00:01:12,439 --> 00:01:13,940
Who is it?

20
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:16,443
How do you like the new water
glasses, Ricky?

21
00:01:16,443 --> 00:01:17,944
Who's coming for dinner, Lucy?

22
00:01:17,944 --> 00:01:20,947
Doesn't the table look beautiful
tonight?

23
00:01:20,947 --> 00:01:22,949
Lucy, who is it?

24
00:01:22,949 --> 00:01:24,451
Some people.

25
00:01:26,453 --> 00:01:28,955
Lucy...

26
00:01:28,955 --> 00:01:31,958
Whom is coming here for dinner
tonight?

27
00:01:31,958 --> 00:01:36,963
Whom, you mean, besides meem and
youm?

28
00:01:36,963 --> 00:01:40,467
Never mind that.
What are their names?

29
00:01:40,467 --> 00:01:41,468
Fred and Ethel Mertz.

30
00:01:41,968 --> 00:01:42,969
Wait a minute.

31
00:01:42,969 --> 00:01:44,971
I thought you said Fred and Ethel had
a big fight

32
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:46,973
and they were mad at each other.

33
00:01:46,973 --> 00:01:47,974
They are.

34
00:01:47,974 --> 00:01:48,975
I thought you said

35
00:01:48,975 --> 00:01:50,477
they weren't speaking to each other.

36
00:01:50,977 --> 00:01:51,978
They aren't.

37
00:01:51,978 --> 00:01:53,480
And that he was staying at the Y.

38
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:54,981
He is.

39
00:01:54,981 --> 00:01:56,983
And she won't let him in the house.

40
00:01:56,983 --> 00:01:57,984
She won't.

41
00:01:59,486 --> 00:02:00,987
Well, if they are

42
00:02:00,987 --> 00:02:03,990
and they aren't and he is and she
won't-- how come?

43
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:07,494
Well, I thought...

44
00:02:07,494 --> 00:02:10,997
Lucy Esmeralda Macgillicuddy

45
00:02:10,997 --> 00:02:11,998
Ricardo.

46
00:02:11,998 --> 00:02:13,500
Yes?

47
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,001
I thought we had an understanding

48
00:02:15,001 --> 00:02:17,003
that you were not going to mess
around

49
00:02:17,003 --> 00:02:18,004
in other people's affairs.

50
00:02:18,505 --> 00:02:19,506
But, Ricky...

51
00:02:19,506 --> 00:02:22,008
Lucy, sometimes I think that you
don't have

52
00:02:22,509 --> 00:02:24,010
anything inside your head.

53
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:26,012
Now, come on.
Let me see.

54
00:02:28,014 --> 00:02:30,517
Hey, that picture on the wall is
crooked.

55
00:02:30,517 --> 00:02:32,519
Oh, stop.

56
00:02:32,519 --> 00:02:35,522
Now, Ricky, I can't stand seeing them
apart like this.

57
00:02:36,022 --> 00:02:38,525
I heard Ethel downstairs crying all
morning.

58
00:02:38,525 --> 00:02:41,027
I'll bet Fred's eating his heart out
too.

59
00:02:41,027 --> 00:02:42,028
Hah!

60
00:02:42,028 --> 00:02:43,530
What do you mean, hah?

61
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:46,032
How would you like to be separated
from me

62
00:02:46,032 --> 00:02:47,534
for three whole days.

63
00:02:47,534 --> 00:02:48,535
Ah!

64
00:02:48,535 --> 00:02:50,537
Oh... Now really, Ricky, it's up to
us

65
00:02:50,537 --> 00:02:52,539
to get Fred and Ethel back together
again.

66
00:02:52,539 --> 00:02:53,540
Say you'll help me.

67
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:54,541
Well, it would be nice.

68
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:55,542
Yeah.

69
00:02:55,542 --> 00:02:57,043
And I guess

70
00:02:57,043 --> 00:02:59,045
after you've gone through all this
trouble

71
00:02:59,045 --> 00:03:01,548
and this far that the cast is dead.

72
00:03:01,548 --> 00:03:03,550
"The cast is dead"?

73
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:04,551
Yeah, you know...

74
00:03:04,551 --> 00:03:06,052
Don't tell me.
Don't tell me.

75
00:03:06,052 --> 00:03:08,054
The die is cast.

76
00:03:12,058 --> 00:03:14,060
That's what I said.

77
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:16,062
Oh, fine.

78
00:03:16,062 --> 00:03:17,063
Now, tell me, Dorothea Dix

79
00:03:17,063 --> 00:03:19,065
if they are not speaking to each
other

80
00:03:19,065 --> 00:03:21,067
how did you get them to come here for
dinner?

81
00:03:21,067 --> 00:03:23,570
Neither one knows that the other one
is coming.

82
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:27,073
Oh, that should be interesting.

83
00:03:27,073 --> 00:03:28,074
ETHEL: Yoo-hoo.

84
00:03:28,074 --> 00:03:29,576
There's one of the lovebirds now.

85
00:03:29,576 --> 00:03:31,077
Yeah, before the evening is over

86
00:03:31,077 --> 00:03:33,079
there'll be feathers flying all over
the place.

87
00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:33,580
Oh, now, stop.

88
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:34,581
Hi, Lucy.

89
00:03:34,581 --> 00:03:35,582
Hi, Ethel.

90
00:03:35,582 --> 00:03:37,083
Hi, Ricky.
Hello, Ethel.

91
00:03:37,083 --> 00:03:38,585
Let me take your coat, honey.

92
00:03:38,585 --> 00:03:40,086
Thanks.
Here, I'll take it, dear.

93
00:03:40,086 --> 00:03:41,087
Gee, you look beautiful.

94
00:03:41,087 --> 00:03:42,589
It was nice of you to ask me to
dinner.

95
00:03:43,089 --> 00:03:44,591
I almost didn't make it.
I just got home.

96
00:03:44,591 --> 00:03:46,593
I've been so busy socially, you know

97
00:03:46,593 --> 00:03:47,594
dancing every night

98
00:03:48,094 --> 00:03:50,096
luncheons and teas every afternoon.

99
00:03:50,096 --> 00:03:51,097
Oh, really?

100
00:03:51,097 --> 00:03:52,599
Oh, yes.

101
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:57,103
I've been having a wonderful time.

102
00:03:58,605 --> 00:04:00,106
Oh, bread.

103
00:04:01,608 --> 00:04:04,110
I haven't eaten since he left.

104
00:04:04,611 --> 00:04:06,112
Oh, really?

105
00:04:06,112 --> 00:04:08,114
Gee, you sure must miss him.

106
00:04:08,615 --> 00:04:09,616
I do not.

107
00:04:09,616 --> 00:04:12,118
He didn't leave me any money, the big
fat slob.

108
00:04:15,121 --> 00:04:17,123
Well, we'll eat right away, dear.

109
00:04:17,624 --> 00:04:18,625
Good.

110
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:21,127
Oh, four places, is someone else
coming?

111
00:04:21,127 --> 00:04:22,629
Well, I-I didn't tell you, Ethel

112
00:04:23,129 --> 00:04:25,632
but I've invited a fascinating man
for you.

113
00:04:25,632 --> 00:04:26,633
He's a real dream.

114
00:04:26,633 --> 00:04:28,635
Oh, Lucy, you shouldn't have done
that.

115
00:04:29,135 --> 00:04:32,138
After all, I'm still a married woman.

116
00:04:32,138 --> 00:04:33,139
What's he like?

117
00:04:34,641 --> 00:04:35,642
I'm not going to tell you.

118
00:04:36,142 --> 00:04:37,143
I want you to be surprised.

119
00:04:37,143 --> 00:04:38,645
She will be.

120
00:04:38,645 --> 00:04:40,146
Oh, this is exciting.

121
00:04:40,146 --> 00:04:41,648
I better go powder my nose.

122
00:04:42,148 --> 00:04:43,149
He's a real dream, huh?

123
00:04:43,149 --> 00:04:44,150
Uh-huh.

124
00:04:44,651 --> 00:04:46,653
Can I put on some of your good
perfume?

125
00:04:46,653 --> 00:04:47,654
Sure.

126
00:04:50,156 --> 00:04:52,158
Well, you really cooked one up this
time.

127
00:04:52,158 --> 00:04:53,159
Now, don't worry.

128
00:04:53,159 --> 00:04:55,161
Everything's going to be all right.

129
00:04:55,161 --> 00:04:56,162
You know what'll happen?

130
00:04:56,162 --> 00:04:57,664
Yeah, they'll kill each other

131
00:04:57,664 --> 00:04:59,165
right in front of our eyes.

132
00:04:59,165 --> 00:05:00,667
They will not.

133
00:05:00,667 --> 00:05:02,168
(doorbell buzzes)

134
00:05:02,168 --> 00:05:05,171
That must be the other lovebird now.

135
00:05:06,172 --> 00:05:07,173
Hi, Rick.

136
00:05:07,173 --> 00:05:08,174
Hello, Fred.
How are you?

137
00:05:08,174 --> 00:05:09,676
Gee, I'm glad to see you.

138
00:05:09,676 --> 00:05:10,677
We sure miss you around here.

139
00:05:11,177 --> 00:05:12,178
How's everything down at the Y?

140
00:05:12,178 --> 00:05:13,179
Oh, fine, fine, thanks.

141
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:14,180
Hi, Lucy.

142
00:05:14,681 --> 00:05:15,181
Hi, Fred.

143
00:05:15,682 --> 00:05:16,683
I brought you something.

144
00:05:16,683 --> 00:05:17,684
Oh, thank you.

145
00:05:17,684 --> 00:05:19,185
You're welcome.

146
00:05:19,185 --> 00:05:20,687
I was going to call up and say hello

147
00:05:20,687 --> 00:05:22,188
but I've really been having a time.

148
00:05:22,188 --> 00:05:23,189
Really?
Yeah.

149
00:05:23,189 --> 00:05:24,691
You really been living it up, eh?

150
00:05:24,691 --> 00:05:26,693
Have I? Rick, I'm a free man again.

151
00:05:26,693 --> 00:05:28,695
You wouldn't believe the things I
been doing.

152
00:05:28,695 --> 00:05:30,196
What have you been doing?

153
00:05:30,196 --> 00:05:32,198
Everything I did before I was
married.

154
00:05:32,198 --> 00:05:33,199
No kidding?

155
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:39,706
Yeah, handball, basketball,
badminton, squash...

156
00:05:39,706 --> 00:05:41,207
I'm pooped.

157
00:05:42,709 --> 00:05:43,710
Gee, when do we eat?

158
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:46,212
I-I've been living on peanut butter
sandwiches.

159
00:05:46,713 --> 00:05:48,715
Oh, are you expecting somebody else?

160
00:05:48,715 --> 00:05:51,217
Well, um, yes, Fred.

161
00:05:51,217 --> 00:05:53,219
I-I-I took the liberty

162
00:05:53,219 --> 00:05:55,221
of inviting a nice young lady

163
00:05:55,221 --> 00:05:57,223
to be your dinner companion.

164
00:05:57,724 --> 00:05:58,224
A young lady?

165
00:05:58,725 --> 00:06:00,226
Yeah, a cute young chick.

166
00:06:00,226 --> 00:06:02,228
Oh.

167
00:06:02,228 --> 00:06:04,230
Well, bring her on.

168
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:05,732
Ho, ho, ho.

169
00:06:05,732 --> 00:06:06,733
A young chick, huh?

170
00:06:07,233 --> 00:06:07,734
(whistling)

171
00:06:08,234 --> 00:06:08,735
Am I ready.

172
00:06:09,235 --> 00:06:11,237
LUCY: Yoo-hoo, he's here.

173
00:06:11,237 --> 00:06:12,739
Come on out now.

174
00:06:14,741 --> 00:06:15,742
(giggling)

175
00:06:19,746 --> 00:06:21,247
What are you doing here?

176
00:06:21,247 --> 00:06:24,250
What are you doing here?

177
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:26,753
Lucy, is that my date?

178
00:06:28,254 --> 00:06:30,256
He's no dream; he's a nightmare.

179
00:06:31,758 --> 00:06:34,260
Is that your idea of a cute young
chick?

180
00:06:35,762 --> 00:06:38,264
You'll never shop for my poultry.

181
00:06:40,767 --> 00:06:41,267
Aw, now come on.

182
00:06:41,768 --> 00:06:42,769
As long as we're all here

183
00:06:42,769 --> 00:06:44,270
why don't we sit down and eat?

184
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:45,772
Yeah, come on, Ethel.

185
00:06:45,772 --> 00:06:48,274
No, thanks, I just lost my appetite.

186
00:06:48,775 --> 00:06:49,776
Me too.
I'm leaving.

187
00:06:49,776 --> 00:06:50,777
Where's my coat?

188
00:06:51,277 --> 00:06:52,779
Where's my coat?

189
00:06:52,779 --> 00:06:56,282
Well, all right, Ricky, get their
coats.

190
00:06:56,282 --> 00:06:57,283
Okay.

191
00:07:05,792 --> 00:07:07,293
Here you are, Fred.

192
00:07:07,293 --> 00:07:08,294
Well, thanks.

193
00:07:08,294 --> 00:07:09,295
Here you are, Ethel.

194
00:07:09,796 --> 00:07:10,797
Thank you.

195
00:07:21,808 --> 00:07:23,810
Well, as long as she's leaving

196
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:26,813
I guess I could stay and help you eat
that food.

197
00:07:31,317 --> 00:07:32,819
You're not letting him stay

198
00:07:32,819 --> 00:07:35,822
and do you out of this beautiful
roast beef

199
00:07:35,822 --> 00:07:36,823
are you, Ethel?

200
00:07:36,823 --> 00:07:37,824
Um, no, why should I?

201
00:07:37,824 --> 00:07:39,826
Good. Let's everybody sit down.

202
00:07:39,826 --> 00:07:41,828
That a girl.
Give me that coat.

203
00:07:41,828 --> 00:07:44,330
Yeah, Fred, you sit over here by me.

204
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:45,832
Well, thanks.

205
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:50,336
Uh, you two don't mind sharing the
piano bench, do you?

206
00:08:02,849 --> 00:08:04,851
Now, let's see here.

207
00:08:11,357 --> 00:08:12,358
How's that, Ethel?

208
00:08:12,358 --> 00:08:13,860
Not too much fat is there?

209
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:16,362
There certainly is.

210
00:08:16,362 --> 00:08:18,364
LUCY: He means the meat.

211
00:08:18,364 --> 00:08:21,367
Oh, oh, no, the meat looks fine.

212
00:08:22,869 --> 00:08:23,870
Oh, thanks.
Here you are, Ethel.

213
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:25,371
Thank you.

214
00:08:25,371 --> 00:08:26,372
Here you are, Fred.

215
00:08:26,372 --> 00:08:27,874
Thank you.

216
00:08:28,374 --> 00:08:29,375
Ah, potatoes.

217
00:08:29,876 --> 00:08:32,378
Nice and hot too.

218
00:08:32,378 --> 00:08:33,379
And beans.

219
00:08:33,379 --> 00:08:35,381
LUCY: No potatoes, Ricky?

220
00:08:35,381 --> 00:08:36,883
No, I'm strictly a meat man.

221
00:08:36,883 --> 00:08:38,384
What about you, Fred?

222
00:08:38,384 --> 00:08:39,385
Thank you, Lucy.
Thank you.

223
00:08:39,385 --> 00:08:40,887
Okay, string beans?

224
00:08:40,887 --> 00:08:41,888
If it weren't for you

225
00:08:41,888 --> 00:08:43,890
I wouldn't get anything to eat.

226
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:45,892
Oh, here you are, Ethel.

227
00:08:45,892 --> 00:08:46,893
Thank you.

228
00:08:47,393 --> 00:08:48,394
Want some gravy, Ricky?

229
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:50,396
Yeah, a little bit, please.

230
00:08:50,396 --> 00:08:51,397
Oh, on your meat?

231
00:08:51,397 --> 00:08:52,899
Yeah, right on the meat.

232
00:08:52,899 --> 00:08:54,901
I love gravy.
That's it.

233
00:08:54,901 --> 00:08:55,902
I love gravy.

234
00:08:55,902 --> 00:08:56,903
Yeah?

235
00:08:58,905 --> 00:09:01,407
Yes, I love gravy.

236
00:09:04,911 --> 00:09:05,912
There, Lucy.

237
00:09:05,912 --> 00:09:06,913
Thank you.

238
00:09:06,913 --> 00:09:08,414
You're welcome.

239
00:09:08,414 --> 00:09:10,416
There, now has everybody got
everything?

240
00:09:10,917 --> 00:09:11,417
Yep.
Yeah.

241
00:09:11,918 --> 00:09:13,419
So...

242
00:09:13,419 --> 00:09:15,922
RICKY: This sure looks good.

243
00:09:15,922 --> 00:09:18,424
LUCY: I've never been so hungry.

244
00:09:24,931 --> 00:09:26,432
Oh!

245
00:09:26,432 --> 00:09:27,934
Oh!

246
00:09:27,934 --> 00:09:29,435
Oh!

247
00:09:29,936 --> 00:09:30,937
Ethel, what happened?

248
00:09:31,437 --> 00:09:33,940
He pushed me off the bench, that's
what happened.

249
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:34,941
I did not. She fell off.

250
00:09:34,941 --> 00:09:36,442
Oh, that does it.

251
00:09:36,442 --> 00:09:39,946
Roast beef or no roast beef, I'm
leaving.

252
00:09:39,946 --> 00:09:40,947
Don't bother, I'll go.

253
00:09:41,447 --> 00:09:42,949
Oh, you don't have to go...

254
00:09:42,949 --> 00:09:44,450
Ethel, Ethel, please.

255
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:46,452
Ricky, I guess this was a bad idea of
mine.

256
00:09:46,452 --> 00:09:47,453
Let's get their coats.

257
00:09:47,954 --> 00:09:49,455
All right.

258
00:09:56,462 --> 00:09:57,463
Here you are, Fred.

259
00:09:57,964 --> 00:09:59,465
Thanks.

260
00:09:59,465 --> 00:10:00,466
Here you are, Ethel.

261
00:10:00,967 --> 00:10:01,968
Thanks.

262
00:10:02,969 --> 00:10:03,970
Oh, oh!

263
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:05,972
Why you...

264
00:10:05,972 --> 00:10:07,974
What's going on here?

265
00:10:11,978 --> 00:10:13,980
Lucy, let me out of here.

266
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:15,481
Untie this coat.

267
00:10:15,982 --> 00:10:17,483
Not until you kiss and make up.

268
00:10:17,483 --> 00:10:18,985
I'll never speak to him again

269
00:10:18,985 --> 00:10:20,486
after the things he said to me.

270
00:10:20,987 --> 00:10:22,488
What about the things you said to me?

271
00:10:22,488 --> 00:10:24,991
She said my mother looks like a
weasel.

272
00:10:26,993 --> 00:10:27,994
Apologize, Ethel.

273
00:10:27,994 --> 00:10:28,995
No.

274
00:10:29,495 --> 00:10:30,496
Oh, come on, Ethel.

275
00:10:30,496 --> 00:10:32,498
Tell him you're sorry.

276
00:10:32,498 --> 00:10:33,499
Well, I'm sorry

277
00:10:33,499 --> 00:10:36,502
your mother looks like a weasel.

278
00:10:39,505 --> 00:10:41,007
Now, Ethel...

279
00:10:41,507 --> 00:10:44,010
Well, he should have more
consideration.

280
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:47,013
After all, I gave him the best years
of my life.

281
00:10:47,013 --> 00:10:49,015
Were those the best?

282
00:10:50,966 --> 00:10:53,469
All right, all right, now you're
even.

283
00:10:53,469 --> 00:10:55,971
Now, what are your terms for making
up, Ethel?

284
00:10:55,971 --> 00:10:58,474
Well, let him apologize.

285
00:10:58,474 --> 00:10:59,475
He started it.

286
00:10:59,475 --> 00:11:00,476
I did not.

287
00:11:00,476 --> 00:11:01,477
ETHEL: You did too.

288
00:11:01,477 --> 00:11:02,978
I did not! I never...

289
00:11:02,978 --> 00:11:05,481
All right! All right. It doesn't
matter who started it.

290
00:11:05,481 --> 00:11:06,982
What matters is how it got started.

291
00:11:07,483 --> 00:11:08,484
What was it all about?

292
00:11:08,484 --> 00:11:09,985
Well...

293
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:12,988
Uh...

294
00:11:12,988 --> 00:11:15,491
I was, uh, uh...

295
00:11:15,991 --> 00:11:19,995
He said, uh...

296
00:11:20,496 --> 00:11:21,497
I forget.

297
00:11:21,497 --> 00:11:22,498
So do I.

298
00:11:22,498 --> 00:11:24,500
You see, you can't even remember.

299
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:27,002
Well, it wasn't how it started.

300
00:11:27,002 --> 00:11:29,505
It was the things we said afterward.

301
00:11:30,005 --> 00:11:31,507
I'm sorry, Fred.

302
00:11:31,507 --> 00:11:33,509
I apologize, honey bun.

303
00:11:33,509 --> 00:11:35,511
Sweetie pie.

304
00:11:35,511 --> 00:11:37,513
Baby doll.

305
00:11:37,513 --> 00:11:40,015
Sugar lips.

306
00:11:41,517 --> 00:11:44,520
You know, this is pretty sickening.

307
00:11:47,022 --> 00:11:50,025
I liked them better when they were
mad.

308
00:11:50,025 --> 00:11:51,527
Let's get back to the dinner.

309
00:11:51,527 --> 00:11:53,028
Now we can eat.

310
00:11:53,028 --> 00:11:55,030
Dinner is getting cold.

311
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:57,533
Doesn't that food look great?

312
00:11:57,533 --> 00:11:59,034
(all talking at once)

313
00:11:59,535 --> 00:12:01,036
Aren't quarrels silly?

314
00:12:01,036 --> 00:12:03,038
RICKY: They sure are, honey.

315
00:12:03,038 --> 00:12:05,541
When's the last time we had a fight,
Ricky?

316
00:12:05,541 --> 00:12:07,042
Gosh, I don't remember, dear.

317
00:12:07,042 --> 00:12:08,043
Neither do I.

318
00:12:08,043 --> 00:12:10,045
See, why don't you two be like us?

319
00:12:10,045 --> 00:12:11,547
That's a good idea.

320
00:12:11,547 --> 00:12:13,048
I'll dye my hair red

321
00:12:13,048 --> 00:12:15,050
and Fred can speak with an accent.

322
00:12:15,551 --> 00:12:16,552
Well, if I remember correctly

323
00:12:17,052 --> 00:12:18,053
you two had your spats.

324
00:12:18,053 --> 00:12:19,054
Well...

325
00:12:19,054 --> 00:12:20,556
Ricky only got to go to the fights

326
00:12:21,056 --> 00:12:22,057
with me last month

327
00:12:22,057 --> 00:12:24,059
because you weren't speaking to each
other.

328
00:12:24,059 --> 00:12:25,060
RICKY: Oh, yeah.

329
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:27,062
But it didn't last long.

330
00:12:27,062 --> 00:12:29,565
No, I gave in and put an end to it.

331
00:12:29,565 --> 00:12:32,067
Yeah, you want some more gravy,
Ethel?

332
00:12:32,067 --> 00:12:33,569
What'd you say, Ricky?

333
00:12:33,569 --> 00:12:34,570
You put an end to it?

334
00:12:35,070 --> 00:12:36,572
I was the one who gave in.

335
00:12:36,572 --> 00:12:38,073
Oh, pardon me, honey, but, uh

336
00:12:38,073 --> 00:12:40,576
I was the one that called the whole
thing off, remember?

337
00:12:41,076 --> 00:12:44,580
You? I went all the way down to your
club to apologize--

338
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:45,581
remember?

339
00:12:46,081 --> 00:12:47,583
Well, honey, that was after--

340
00:12:47,583 --> 00:12:50,085
you went down all the way to the club
and apologized--

341
00:12:50,586 --> 00:12:52,087
after I sent you a dozen roses

342
00:12:52,087 --> 00:12:54,590
with a card saying that I was wrong,
remember?

343
00:12:54,590 --> 00:12:56,592
Before, darling.

344
00:12:57,092 --> 00:12:59,094
After, baby.

345
00:12:59,094 --> 00:13:01,597
Before, dear.

346
00:13:01,597 --> 00:13:04,099
After, sweetheart.

347
00:13:04,099 --> 00:13:05,100
Before.

348
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:06,602
After.

349
00:13:06,602 --> 00:13:08,604
Before.

350
00:13:08,604 --> 00:13:10,105
It's your serve.

351
00:13:14,610 --> 00:13:15,611
After!

352
00:13:17,112 --> 00:13:18,614
I remember how tough it was

353
00:13:18,614 --> 00:13:20,115
to-to-to-to write that card

354
00:13:20,115 --> 00:13:22,117
saying that I was wrong when I was
right.

355
00:13:22,117 --> 00:13:25,120
Oh, you thought that you were right?

356
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:27,122
I certainly did, and I still do.

357
00:13:27,122 --> 00:13:28,624
Well, it's good to know

358
00:13:28,624 --> 00:13:30,626
that I'm married to a hypocrite.

359
00:13:30,626 --> 00:13:32,127
Hypocrite?

360
00:13:33,629 --> 00:13:35,631
What's a hypocrite?

361
00:13:35,631 --> 00:13:37,633
A person who says one thing

362
00:13:37,633 --> 00:13:38,634
and means another.

363
00:13:39,134 --> 00:13:39,635
Thanks.

364
00:13:40,135 --> 00:13:41,136
Oh, yeah?

365
00:13:41,136 --> 00:13:42,137
Yeah.

366
00:13:42,137 --> 00:13:43,639
Oh, now, Ricky take it easy.

367
00:13:43,639 --> 00:13:45,140
She can't talk to me that way.

368
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:46,141
But she's excited.

369
00:13:46,141 --> 00:13:47,142
That's no excuse.

370
00:13:47,643 --> 00:13:49,144
That's plenty 'scuse.

371
00:13:49,144 --> 00:13:52,648
And don't you make fun of my English.

372
00:13:52,648 --> 00:13:55,150
Hmm, that's English.

373
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:58,153
Si, es ingles, yo hablo muy bien, muy
perfectamente.

374
00:13:58,153 --> 00:13:59,154
Usted no me tiene

375
00:13:59,655 --> 00:14:00,656
que decir que no hablo bien.

376
00:14:00,656 --> 00:14:04,159
How dare you say that to me.

377
00:14:04,159 --> 00:14:05,661
What did I say?

378
00:14:05,661 --> 00:14:08,664
I don't know, but how dare you!

379
00:14:09,164 --> 00:14:13,168
I'll show you who gives in first in
this family.

380
00:14:13,669 --> 00:14:15,671
Mira que me decia a mi que yo no se
hablar ingles

381
00:14:15,671 --> 00:14:17,172
cuando lo he estudiado perfectamente

382
00:14:17,172 --> 00:14:18,674
en todas las universidades muchisimos
anos.

383
00:14:18,674 --> 00:14:20,175
Yo hablo mejor que toda

384
00:14:20,175 --> 00:14:21,677
la gente que esta sentada en la mesa
aqui.

385
00:14:21,677 --> 00:14:23,679
And whenever you're ready to call me
and apologize

386
00:14:23,679 --> 00:14:24,680
you can call me down at the club!

387
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:27,182
Don't hold your breath!

388
00:14:27,182 --> 00:14:28,183
Ha!

389
00:14:30,185 --> 00:14:31,687
Fred, Fred, we'd better go.

390
00:14:31,687 --> 00:14:32,688
Yes, yes...

391
00:14:32,688 --> 00:14:34,690
No, no, no, don't go.

392
00:14:34,690 --> 00:14:36,692
We'll just finish our dinner.

393
00:14:36,692 --> 00:14:39,194
Certainly not going to let him

394
00:14:39,194 --> 00:14:40,696
spoil a dinner for us.

395
00:14:40,696 --> 00:14:44,199
This meat is cooked just the way I
like it

396
00:14:44,199 --> 00:14:47,202
nice and juicy.

397
00:15:02,268 --> 00:15:04,270
Yoo-hoo.

398
00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:06,772
Lucy, where are you?

399
00:15:06,772 --> 00:15:08,774
I'm in the bedroom.

400
00:15:12,778 --> 00:15:14,780
Good morning.

401
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:16,782
Morning.

402
00:15:16,782 --> 00:15:20,286
Oh...

403
00:15:20,286 --> 00:15:21,787
You've been crying.

404
00:15:21,787 --> 00:15:23,289
I have not.

405
00:15:23,289 --> 00:15:26,292
A rabbit should have such pink eyes.

406
00:15:26,292 --> 00:15:28,294
I'm getting a cold.

407
00:15:28,294 --> 00:15:29,295
Oh.

408
00:15:29,295 --> 00:15:32,298
I gather Ricky didn't come home last
night.

409
00:15:32,798 --> 00:15:34,800
You mean that funny-looking Cuban

410
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,802
that used to hang around here?

411
00:15:37,303 --> 00:15:40,306
Yeah, that's the guy I had reference
to.

412
00:15:40,306 --> 00:15:42,808
No, he didn't come home last night

413
00:15:42,808 --> 00:15:45,311
and he didn't call this morning.

414
00:15:45,311 --> 00:15:47,813
Not that it makes any difference to
me.

415
00:15:47,813 --> 00:15:51,317
Oh, I can see it doesn't matter to
old indifferent you

416
00:15:51,317 --> 00:15:52,318
Why don't call him up

417
00:15:52,818 --> 00:15:53,819
and tell him you're sorry?

418
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,321
What? Swallow my pride?

419
00:15:55,321 --> 00:15:57,823
Call him up and go crawling back to
him?

420
00:15:57,823 --> 00:15:58,824
Hah!

421
00:15:58,824 --> 00:15:59,825
Well...

422
00:16:00,326 --> 00:16:03,329
Besides, the line was busy.

423
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:05,831
I thought so.

424
00:16:05,831 --> 00:16:07,333
Call him up again.

425
00:16:07,333 --> 00:16:08,334
I will not.

426
00:16:08,334 --> 00:16:09,335
Why not?

427
00:16:09,335 --> 00:16:11,337
I called him once; now it's his turn.

428
00:16:11,337 --> 00:16:12,838
What if he never calls you?

429
00:16:12,838 --> 00:16:15,341
Then we'll just never see each other
again.

430
00:16:15,341 --> 00:16:18,844
Oh, we can't have that.

431
00:16:18,844 --> 00:16:19,845
Now, let's see.

432
00:16:19,845 --> 00:16:21,847
I could invite you both to dinner

433
00:16:21,847 --> 00:16:23,349
without telling the other

434
00:16:23,849 --> 00:16:25,851
but that's been done a lot lately.

435
00:16:25,851 --> 00:16:29,855
Yeah, that's a pretty stale bit.

436
00:16:29,855 --> 00:16:32,858
I know, we'll use the old sympathy
routine.

437
00:16:32,858 --> 00:16:34,360
Sympathy routine?

438
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:36,362
Yeah. You know how families are--

439
00:16:36,362 --> 00:16:38,364
no matter what differences they've
had

440
00:16:38,364 --> 00:16:41,367
they always unite in cases of
sickness, accident

441
00:16:41,367 --> 00:16:42,868
and terrible tragedy.

442
00:16:42,868 --> 00:16:44,870
What are you talking about?

443
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:47,873
I'll call up Ricky and tell him
you've been run over by a bus.

444
00:16:47,873 --> 00:16:49,875
Run over by a bus?

445
00:16:50,376 --> 00:16:50,876
Yeah.

446
00:16:51,377 --> 00:16:52,878
Well, that seems rather drastic.

447
00:16:52,878 --> 00:16:54,380
Oh, we'll only pretend.

448
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:55,881
Oh.

449
00:16:56,382 --> 00:16:57,883
I'll wrap you all up in bandages

450
00:16:57,883 --> 00:16:59,385
and then I'll call him up

451
00:16:59,385 --> 00:17:01,887
and tell him you've had a terrible
accident.

452
00:17:01,887 --> 00:17:02,888
That'll bring him back.

453
00:17:02,888 --> 00:17:03,889
Well, it might work.

454
00:17:03,889 --> 00:17:05,391
It can't miss.

455
00:17:05,391 --> 00:17:06,892
Have you got plenty of adhesive tape

456
00:17:06,892 --> 00:17:08,394
and bandages in the house?

457
00:17:08,394 --> 00:17:09,895
Well, that all depends.

458
00:17:09,895 --> 00:17:11,397
On what?

459
00:17:11,397 --> 00:17:14,400
On what kind of a bus I get hit by,
local or express.

460
00:17:41,427 --> 00:17:43,929
You like the peanut butter sandwiches

461
00:17:43,929 --> 00:17:45,431
they serve here, Rick?

462
00:17:45,431 --> 00:17:46,432
Kind of stick

463
00:17:46,432 --> 00:17:48,934
to the roof of your mouth, don't
they?

464
00:17:56,442 --> 00:17:57,943
Yeah.

465
00:17:57,943 --> 00:18:01,947
Oh, just give me a small grape juice.

466
00:18:01,947 --> 00:18:04,450
It's none of my business, Rick, but
this is silly.

467
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:06,952
Why don't you break down and call
Lucy?

468
00:18:06,952 --> 00:18:08,454
What? And give her the satisfaction

469
00:18:08,454 --> 00:18:09,955
of knowing that I gave in first?

470
00:18:09,955 --> 00:18:11,457
Well, I was just thinking.

471
00:18:11,957 --> 00:18:13,959
Besides, the line was busy.

472
00:18:15,461 --> 00:18:16,962
Well, what do you want to do?

473
00:18:16,962 --> 00:18:19,465
Go through life with a sticky upper
plate?

474
00:18:19,965 --> 00:18:21,467
There are other places to eat

475
00:18:21,467 --> 00:18:22,968
besides this drugstore, you know.

476
00:18:23,469 --> 00:18:24,470
You know what I mean.

477
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:26,472
I know all about this business.

478
00:18:26,472 --> 00:18:28,474
Why don't you swallow your pride?

479
00:18:28,974 --> 00:18:30,976
I'm having enough trouble with this
sandwich.

480
00:18:33,479 --> 00:18:34,480
If only we could think

481
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:36,982
of a way to bring you two together

482
00:18:36,982 --> 00:18:39,485
without making you make up first.

483
00:18:39,485 --> 00:18:41,487
Let's give this a good think.

484
00:18:41,487 --> 00:18:42,488
Yeah.

485
00:18:43,989 --> 00:18:48,994
(both slurping)

486
00:18:51,997 --> 00:18:54,500
We're very noisy thinkers.

487
00:18:55,501 --> 00:18:58,003
If only the apartment would catch on
fire

488
00:18:58,003 --> 00:19:00,506
and you could rush in and save Lucy.

489
00:19:00,506 --> 00:19:02,508
What'd she put in there?

490
00:19:02,508 --> 00:19:05,010
No, I saw it last week on television.

491
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:07,012
This girl couldn't stand this guy

492
00:19:07,012 --> 00:19:09,014
until he saved her life in a fire.

493
00:19:09,515 --> 00:19:12,017
Then she was so grateful, she married
him.

494
00:19:12,017 --> 00:19:14,019
Well, thanks, Fred, that's a swell
idea

495
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:15,521
but I hardly think

496
00:19:15,521 --> 00:19:18,524
that I will set your apartment
building on fire.

497
00:19:18,524 --> 00:19:21,527
Of course, that's it.

498
00:19:21,527 --> 00:19:23,529
You must be daffy or heavily insured.

499
00:19:24,029 --> 00:19:25,030
Oh, you don't understand.

500
00:19:25,531 --> 00:19:28,033
We just pretend to set the apartment
on fire.

501
00:19:28,033 --> 00:19:29,535
How do you pretend to have a fire?

502
00:19:30,035 --> 00:19:31,537
It's easy.

503
00:19:33,038 --> 00:19:35,541
(no dialogue)

504
00:19:41,547 --> 00:19:43,549
That strap tight enough, Lucy?

505
00:19:44,049 --> 00:19:44,550
I guess so.

506
00:19:45,050 --> 00:19:46,051
How about this?
A little tighter.

507
00:19:46,051 --> 00:19:47,052
How's that?
Okay.

508
00:19:47,052 --> 00:19:48,053
This comfortable?

509
00:19:48,554 --> 00:19:49,555
Yeah.

510
00:19:49,555 --> 00:19:51,557
Now, put your arm in this sling.

511
00:19:51,557 --> 00:19:53,058
Oh.

512
00:19:53,559 --> 00:19:54,560
There.

513
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:55,561
Okay.

514
00:19:55,561 --> 00:19:57,563
That's great.
You look fine.

515
00:19:57,563 --> 00:20:01,066
I hope you got the number of the bus
that hit me.

516
00:20:01,066 --> 00:20:02,568
You know

517
00:20:02,568 --> 00:20:04,570
you look like you really were hit.

518
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:06,572
And dragged nine blocks.

519
00:20:06,572 --> 00:20:09,074
Come on, now, get in bed.

520
00:20:21,587 --> 00:20:24,089
Oh, here, I'll help you.

521
00:20:24,089 --> 00:20:25,591
Get your legs up.

522
00:20:25,591 --> 00:20:27,593
Want another pillow?

523
00:20:27,593 --> 00:20:28,594
Yeah.

524
00:20:28,594 --> 00:20:30,095
Oh.

525
00:20:31,096 --> 00:20:32,097
How's that?

526
00:20:32,598 --> 00:20:33,599
Okay. Ooh...
I got an itch.

527
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:35,100
Where?
Right under my arm.

528
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:36,602
Right back there.

529
00:20:36,602 --> 00:20:38,604
Right there, to the right, to the
right.

530
00:20:38,604 --> 00:20:40,105
Over, over, up.
Over?

531
00:20:40,105 --> 00:20:41,607
Ah! Oh!

532
00:20:44,109 --> 00:20:45,611
Thanks.

533
00:20:46,612 --> 00:20:49,114
I got to go before Ricky gets home.

534
00:20:49,114 --> 00:20:51,116
Are you sure he's coming, Ethel?

535
00:20:51,116 --> 00:20:52,618
I called the club, and they said he
was out

536
00:20:52,618 --> 00:20:53,619
but they'd give him the message.

537
00:20:53,619 --> 00:20:55,621
Well, I hope he hurries.

538
00:20:55,621 --> 00:20:57,122
Are you okay?

539
00:20:57,122 --> 00:21:00,125
Okay? I've been in a terrible
accident.

540
00:21:00,125 --> 00:21:02,127
Good luck.

541
00:21:18,143 --> 00:21:20,145
She must be in the bedroom.

542
00:21:20,145 --> 00:21:21,647
Pull that couch out of there.

543
00:21:22,147 --> 00:21:22,648
Okay.

544
00:21:23,148 --> 00:21:24,149
Hurry up.

545
00:21:24,149 --> 00:21:26,652
Hurry up.
That ought to do it.

546
00:21:26,652 --> 00:21:28,153
Hook up the fan.

547
00:21:28,153 --> 00:21:29,154
Okay.

548
00:21:29,154 --> 00:21:30,656
Here, here's the switch.

549
00:21:31,156 --> 00:21:32,658
Right in here.
I got it.

550
00:21:32,658 --> 00:21:33,659
Go ahead.

551
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:36,662
Think this ought to do it?

552
00:21:36,662 --> 00:21:38,664
Yeah, looks like it.

553
00:21:38,664 --> 00:21:40,666
Help, fire, the building's on fire.

554
00:21:40,666 --> 00:21:42,668
(siren sounding)

555
00:21:42,668 --> 00:21:45,671
Run for your lives!

556
00:22:11,697 --> 00:22:13,198
Hey, what's going on here?

557
00:22:13,699 --> 00:22:15,200
What's going on here?

558
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,702
Ricky, I'm glad you're here.

559
00:22:16,702 --> 00:22:18,704
Lucy's trapped in the bedroom.

560
00:22:18,704 --> 00:22:21,206
Well, I'm going to go in there and
save her.

561
00:22:21,206 --> 00:22:24,710
No, no, the whole place is a solid
wall of flames.

562
00:22:40,726 --> 00:22:43,228
I'm going in there no matter what you
say.

563
00:22:43,228 --> 00:22:44,730
Hold him, men, hold him.

564
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:46,732
Let me go, let me go.

565
00:22:46,732 --> 00:22:47,733
(siren)

566
00:22:47,733 --> 00:22:50,235
I'm going in there and save my wife.

567
00:22:50,235 --> 00:22:52,237
FRED: Stand back.

568
00:22:52,237 --> 00:22:54,740
You'll be burned to a cinder.

569
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:17,763
I'm going in there, men, let me go.

570
00:23:17,763 --> 00:23:20,265
I'm going in there no matter what
happens.

571
00:23:20,766 --> 00:23:21,767
Careful, everybody

572
00:23:21,767 --> 00:23:24,770
the whole building is beginning to
crumble.

573
00:23:53,298 --> 00:23:56,802
I'm going in no matter what happens
to me.

574
00:23:56,802 --> 00:23:59,805
Let me go, let me go, let me go,
fellows.

575
00:24:00,305 --> 00:24:01,807
Don't hold me back.

576
00:24:01,807 --> 00:24:02,808
Do you think it's time to go in?

577
00:24:03,308 --> 00:24:04,309
Yeah.
All right.

578
00:24:04,309 --> 00:24:06,311
I'm going in there.
Lucy, don't worry.

579
00:24:06,311 --> 00:24:07,813
I'm coming in to save you.

580
00:24:07,813 --> 00:24:08,814
Right now. Here we go.

581
00:24:08,814 --> 00:24:09,815
Where are you, Lucy?

582
00:24:10,315 --> 00:24:11,316
Where are you?
Are you in there?

583
00:24:11,316 --> 00:24:12,317
She's not here.

584
00:24:12,818 --> 00:24:15,320
She's not in there.

585
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:16,822
Well, how do you like that.

586
00:24:16,822 --> 00:24:18,824
We went through all that trouble

587
00:24:18,824 --> 00:24:20,325
and she wasn't even here.

588
00:24:22,994 --> 00:24:24,496
Gee, honey, now are you sure

589
00:24:24,996 --> 00:24:26,498
those bandages are fake?

590
00:24:26,498 --> 00:24:27,999
Uh, yeah, honey.

591
00:24:27,999 --> 00:24:29,501
Are you sure you're all right?

592
00:24:29,501 --> 00:24:30,502
I'm fine.

593
00:24:30,502 --> 00:24:33,004
Here, honey, let me help you.

594
00:24:33,004 --> 00:24:34,005
It's a good thing

595
00:24:34,506 --> 00:24:36,508
the Mertzes had their awning up.

596
00:24:38,009 --> 00:24:41,012
Aw, honey, it was all my fault.

597
00:24:41,012 --> 00:24:43,014
No, it was my fault, honey.

598
00:24:43,014 --> 00:24:44,516
Weren't we silly?

599
00:24:44,516 --> 00:24:46,518
Yeah, we'll never argue again.

600
00:24:46,518 --> 00:24:48,520
No, baby.

601
00:24:51,022 --> 00:24:52,524
Are you okay, Lucy?

602
00:24:52,524 --> 00:24:54,025
Yeah, Fred, I'm fine.

603
00:24:54,526 --> 00:24:55,026
Sure?

604
00:24:55,527 --> 00:24:56,528
Sure.

605
00:24:56,528 --> 00:24:57,529
Oh, thank heavens you're all right.

606
00:24:57,529 --> 00:24:59,030
Why? What's the matter?

607
00:24:59,030 --> 00:25:01,032
Well, when I told Ethel the whole gag
was my idea

608
00:25:01,533 --> 00:25:03,535
she got mad and went home to her
mother.

609
00:25:03,535 --> 00:25:04,536
Oh!

610
00:25:10,175 --> 00:25:13,028

00:00:30,797 --> 00:00:32,215
Hurry up, dear.

4
00:00:32,215 --> 00:00:34,217
The Mertzes will be here any minute.

5
00:00:34,718 --> 00:00:36,720
RICKY: I'll be ready, honey.

6
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:38,221
I was just shaving

7
00:00:38,221 --> 00:00:40,223
so I look real nice when I go out
with my wife.

8
00:00:40,223 --> 00:00:43,727
Well, isn't that sweet?

9
00:00:46,229 --> 00:00:48,231
I thought you said you shaved.

10
00:00:48,231 --> 00:00:49,232
I did.

11
00:00:49,232 --> 00:00:50,233
What's the matter with your upper
lip?

12
00:00:50,734 --> 00:00:51,735
Is it out of bounds?

13
00:00:53,236 --> 00:00:54,738
You mean my moustache?

14
00:00:55,238 --> 00:00:57,240
Your what?

15
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:59,242
My moustache.

16
00:01:03,246 --> 00:01:04,247
Ricky, it's true.

17
00:01:04,247 --> 00:01:06,750
Your upper lip has whiskers on it.

18
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:09,252
What do expect, feathers?

19
00:01:09,753 --> 00:01:11,755
No, I expect you to go in there and
shave it off.

20
00:01:11,755 --> 00:01:13,757
You know I don't like a moustache on
you.

21
00:01:13,757 --> 00:01:14,758
Why not?

22
00:01:14,758 --> 00:01:17,260
Because it looks like an eyebrow

23
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:20,764
and your mouth keeps staring at me.

24
00:01:20,764 --> 00:01:23,767
Well, I guess it could use a little
eyebrow pencil

25
00:01:24,267 --> 00:01:25,769
until it gets stronger.

26
00:01:25,769 --> 00:01:27,771
Listen, now, we're going to have this
out right now.

27
00:01:27,771 --> 00:01:29,272
You're going in there and shave that
off?

28
00:01:29,272 --> 00:01:30,774
No.

29
00:01:30,774 --> 00:01:32,776
Come here.

30
00:01:34,277 --> 00:01:35,278
Oh, darn it.

31
00:01:35,278 --> 00:01:36,780
It's still there.

32
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:39,282
I thought maybe I could singe it off.

33
00:01:40,784 --> 00:01:43,286
Oh, honey, you'll love my moustache

34
00:01:43,286 --> 00:01:44,788
once you get used to it.

35
00:01:44,788 --> 00:01:46,790
I will not.

36
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:49,292
Well, honey, just wait till it gets a
little strunger.

37
00:01:49,292 --> 00:01:51,294
It's never get "strunger."

38
00:01:53,296 --> 00:01:55,298
You've tried this before, Ricky.

39
00:01:55,298 --> 00:01:56,800
You know you always end up

40
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,668
looking like a little boy who drank
chocolate milk.

41
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:02,672
Well, you never let me give it a
chance.

42
00:02:02,672 --> 00:02:05,675
This time, I'm going to cultivate it.

43
00:02:06,676 --> 00:02:09,679
What are you going to use on it--
Vigoro?

44
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:11,681
Never mind that.

45
00:02:12,182 --> 00:02:14,184
I look wonderful in a moustache.

46
00:02:14,184 --> 00:02:17,187
You just look silly in a moustache,
Ricky.

47
00:02:17,187 --> 00:02:18,188
I do not.

48
00:02:18,188 --> 00:02:19,189
(doorbell buzzes)

49
00:02:19,189 --> 00:02:20,190
Here are the Mertzes.

50
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:21,191
Let's see what they think.

51
00:02:21,191 --> 00:02:23,193
All right, we'll see.

52
00:02:25,195 --> 00:02:27,197
Well, we'll just see.

53
00:02:27,197 --> 00:02:29,699
Just don't put any words in their
mouth.

54
00:02:29,699 --> 00:02:31,701
Don't worry, I won't have to.

55
00:02:31,701 --> 00:02:33,203
Okay.

56
00:02:34,204 --> 00:02:35,205
Hi, folks.

57
00:02:35,205 --> 00:02:36,206
Hi, Lucy.
Hi, Lucy.

58
00:02:36,206 --> 00:02:37,707
Hi, Ricky.
Hiya.

59
00:02:37,707 --> 00:02:39,709
Hi.
Are you ready to go to the movies?

60
00:02:39,709 --> 00:02:41,711
You are just in time to settle
something.

61
00:02:42,212 --> 00:02:43,213
We are?
Yeah?

62
00:02:43,213 --> 00:02:44,714
Yes. As two impartial observers

63
00:02:44,714 --> 00:02:46,716
we'd like your opinion on something.
Yeah.

64
00:02:46,716 --> 00:02:48,718
Well, I'll be happy to g...

65
00:02:48,718 --> 00:02:50,720
Ricky, you're growing a moustache.

66
00:02:51,221 --> 00:02:52,722
Gee, it looks wonderful.

67
00:02:52,722 --> 00:02:53,723
Well, let me see.

68
00:02:54,224 --> 00:02:55,725
Hey, that looks great.

69
00:02:58,728 --> 00:03:00,730
Now, what did you want our opinion
on?

70
00:03:01,231 --> 00:03:02,232
Nothing, Benedict Ethel.

71
00:03:02,732 --> 00:03:05,235
Well, Ricky and I just had a big, fat
argument

72
00:03:05,235 --> 00:03:08,238
about how ridiculous he looks in that
moustache

73
00:03:08,238 --> 00:03:11,241
and then you had to come in and louse
up everything.

74
00:03:11,741 --> 00:03:13,243
Well, I think he looks handsome.

75
00:03:13,243 --> 00:03:14,244
FRED: I do too.

76
00:03:14,244 --> 00:03:15,245
So do I.

77
00:03:15,245 --> 00:03:17,247
Brother.

78
00:03:17,247 --> 00:03:19,249
Besides, I have a very good reason

79
00:03:19,249 --> 00:03:20,750
for growing this moustache.

80
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:21,751
What is it?

81
00:03:21,751 --> 00:03:24,754
He wants a divorce.

82
00:03:24,754 --> 00:03:28,758
You'll change your tune when you see
me as the star

83
00:03:28,758 --> 00:03:32,762
of the new Technicolor motion picture
Moon over Baghdad.

84
00:03:32,762 --> 00:03:34,264
Ricky! You didn't tell me

85
00:03:34,264 --> 00:03:36,766
you were going to star in a moving
picture.

86
00:03:36,766 --> 00:03:38,268
Well, I was keeping it...

87
00:03:38,268 --> 00:03:39,769
spring it on you as a surprise, you
know?

88
00:03:39,769 --> 00:03:42,772
You know when you're leaving for
Hollywood?

89
00:03:42,772 --> 00:03:43,773
Well, not exactly.

90
00:03:43,773 --> 00:03:45,775
Have you signed your contract yet?

91
00:03:46,276 --> 00:03:47,777
Well, not exactly.

92
00:03:47,777 --> 00:03:49,279
But they've agreed to star you.

93
00:03:49,779 --> 00:03:51,781
Well, not exactly.

94
00:03:52,282 --> 00:03:54,284
Well, what exactly?

95
00:03:54,284 --> 00:03:56,286
Well, a talent scout from Hollywood

96
00:03:56,286 --> 00:03:57,787
is coming to town to look

97
00:03:57,787 --> 00:04:00,290
for someone to star in the picture

98
00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:01,791
and my agent has a friend

99
00:04:02,292 --> 00:04:05,795
whose brother-in-law knows the talent
scout's wife.

100
00:04:08,798 --> 00:04:10,800
Well, what are we waiting for?

101
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,302
Let's pack.

102
00:04:15,305 --> 00:04:16,306
LUCY: Star you in a picture.

103
00:04:16,806 --> 00:04:17,807
Well, don't you worry.

104
00:04:17,807 --> 00:04:19,809
I'll get an appointment to see him.

105
00:04:19,809 --> 00:04:21,311
Yeah, you'll get an appointment

106
00:04:21,311 --> 00:04:23,813
if the agent's friend's
brother-in-law

107
00:04:23,813 --> 00:04:25,815
is still speaking to this talent
scout's wife.

108
00:04:25,815 --> 00:04:29,319
Gee, a real, live talent scout from
Hollywood.

109
00:04:29,319 --> 00:04:32,322
Hey, Rick-- ask him if he can use a
song-and-dance man.

110
00:04:32,322 --> 00:04:33,823
And don't forget about me.

111
00:04:34,324 --> 00:04:35,825
I used to do an oriental dance.

112
00:04:36,326 --> 00:04:39,829
La-dee-da-da, da-da-da, da, da-da-da

113
00:04:39,829 --> 00:04:43,833
I was known as "The Queen of the
Nile."

114
00:04:43,833 --> 00:04:44,834
Oh!

115
00:04:45,335 --> 00:04:47,837
She's a little rusty around Cairo.

116
00:04:48,838 --> 00:04:50,840
Oh, you!

117
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:52,842
All right, come on, are we going

118
00:04:52,842 --> 00:04:53,843
to go to the movies or not?

119
00:04:53,843 --> 00:04:55,345
I'm not leaving here

120
00:04:55,345 --> 00:04:57,847
till you shave off that silly
moustache.

121
00:04:57,847 --> 00:04:59,349
Honey... baby doll...

122
00:04:59,349 --> 00:05:01,351
I'm not going to shave it off

123
00:05:01,351 --> 00:05:03,853
so why don't you just relax and enjoy
it?

124
00:05:03,853 --> 00:05:05,355
I mean it, Ricky.
I'm not leaving here.

125
00:05:05,355 --> 00:05:06,356
ETHEL: Now, Lucy.

126
00:05:06,356 --> 00:05:07,357
No!

127
00:05:07,357 --> 00:05:08,358
All right.

128
00:05:08,358 --> 00:05:09,859
We'll go without her.

129
00:05:09,859 --> 00:05:10,860
Come on.

130
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:11,861
You two go ahead.

131
00:05:12,362 --> 00:05:13,363
I'll stay here with Lucy.

132
00:05:13,863 --> 00:05:14,864
All right. Good-bye, Ethel.

133
00:05:14,864 --> 00:05:16,866
Come on, Fred.
Bring me a bag of popcorn

134
00:05:16,866 --> 00:05:17,867
Okay.
with lots of butter.

135
00:05:17,867 --> 00:05:19,369
Yeah, yeah.

136
00:05:19,869 --> 00:05:20,370
Got 20 cents, Rick?

137
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:21,871
Come on.

138
00:05:22,872 --> 00:05:23,873
Darn that Ricky.

139
00:05:23,873 --> 00:05:26,376
I'll get rid of his cookie-duster
somehow.

140
00:05:26,376 --> 00:05:28,878
You know, my grandfather used to have
a moustache--

141
00:05:28,878 --> 00:05:30,880
a great, big, long handlebar one--

142
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:33,383
and Grandma got rid of it in the
middle of the night.

143
00:05:33,383 --> 00:05:34,884
How?

144
00:05:34,884 --> 00:05:35,885
She tied it around a bedpost

145
00:05:36,386 --> 00:05:37,387
when he was asleep and then yelled
"fire."

146
00:05:37,387 --> 00:05:39,889
Oh!

147
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:42,392
Oh, Ethel!

148
00:05:42,892 --> 00:05:44,894
Hey, that gives me an idea though.

149
00:05:44,894 --> 00:05:45,895
It does?

150
00:05:45,895 --> 00:05:47,397
Yeah. Ricky's not going

151
00:05:47,397 --> 00:05:48,898
to be the only one in this family

152
00:05:48,898 --> 00:05:49,899
with a moustache.

153
00:05:49,899 --> 00:05:50,900
What?

154
00:05:51,401 --> 00:05:51,901
I'm going to glue on a false one

155
00:05:52,402 --> 00:05:52,902
and I'm not going to take it off

156
00:05:53,403 --> 00:05:53,903
till he shaves off his.

157
00:05:54,404 --> 00:05:56,906
Lucy, congratulations.

158
00:05:56,906 --> 00:05:57,907
What for?

159
00:05:57,907 --> 00:05:59,909
You've finally topped yourself.

160
00:05:59,909 --> 00:06:02,412
This is the craziest idea you've had
yet.

161
00:06:02,912 --> 00:06:03,813
(laughing)

162
00:06:08,217 --> 00:06:09,218
ETHEL: Lucy!

163
00:06:09,218 --> 00:06:10,219
Where are you?

164
00:06:10,219 --> 00:06:11,721
I'm in here.

165
00:06:13,723 --> 00:06:14,724
Where have you two been?

166
00:06:14,724 --> 00:06:16,726
Ricky will be home any minute.

167
00:06:16,726 --> 00:06:18,227
We had a hard time finding it.

168
00:06:18,728 --> 00:06:19,729
It was down at the bottom

169
00:06:20,229 --> 00:06:21,230
of my vaudeville trunk.

170
00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:22,231
Well, give it here.
Let's see now.

171
00:06:22,231 --> 00:06:23,232
I'll have to cut off the beard.

172
00:06:23,232 --> 00:06:24,734
Oh, no, you don't.

173
00:06:24,734 --> 00:06:26,235
You can't cut that, Lucy.

174
00:06:26,235 --> 00:06:27,737
Those things are expensive.

175
00:06:27,737 --> 00:06:29,739
Well, I can't wear the whole thing.

176
00:06:30,239 --> 00:06:30,740
Why not?

177
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:31,741
Yeah, why not?

178
00:06:33,242 --> 00:06:35,745
Yeah, why not?

179
00:06:41,751 --> 00:06:44,754
Uncle Sam wants you.

180
00:06:46,756 --> 00:06:48,257
Show me how to stick it on, Fred.

181
00:06:48,257 --> 00:06:49,258
All right.

182
00:06:49,258 --> 00:06:50,760
This is spirit gum.

183
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:52,261
Look, I just put a little

184
00:06:52,261 --> 00:06:53,763
on your upper lip here.

185
00:06:54,263 --> 00:06:55,765
Oh, that smells awful.

186
00:06:59,268 --> 00:07:01,771
Lucy, I'm home.

187
00:07:01,771 --> 00:07:03,773
LUCY: Be right there.

188
00:07:09,779 --> 00:07:11,280
Hi, dear.

189
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,282
Hi, honey.

190
00:07:14,784 --> 00:07:17,787
How's about giving me a nice big
kiss?

191
00:07:17,787 --> 00:07:19,288
There's nothing I...

192
00:07:19,288 --> 00:07:23,292
(screams)

193
00:07:23,292 --> 00:07:26,796
What's the matter?

194
00:07:26,796 --> 00:07:29,298
I thought you were going to kiss me.

195
00:07:29,298 --> 00:07:31,300
Lucy, where did you get that thin'?

196
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:33,803
What "thin"?

197
00:07:36,305 --> 00:07:36,806
Those whiskers.

198
00:07:37,306 --> 00:07:38,307
What whiskers?

199
00:07:38,307 --> 00:07:39,308
These.

200
00:07:39,308 --> 00:07:40,309
Oh, these.

201
00:07:40,309 --> 00:07:41,811
Oh, my five-o'clock shadow?

202
00:07:41,811 --> 00:07:43,813
Guess I didn't give myself

203
00:07:43,813 --> 00:07:45,815
a very close shave this morning.

204
00:07:47,316 --> 00:07:47,817
All right, Lucy.

205
00:07:48,317 --> 00:07:49,318
What are you up to?

206
00:07:49,318 --> 00:07:50,820
Nothing, nothing.

207
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:52,822
I'm just growing this so that I can
get a part

208
00:07:52,822 --> 00:07:56,325
in that Technicolor movie called Moon
Over the North Pole.

209
00:07:56,325 --> 00:07:58,327
I'm going to play Santa Claus.

210
00:07:58,327 --> 00:07:59,829
Okay, okay, joke's over.

211
00:07:59,829 --> 00:08:02,832
Now, take that ridiculous thing off
your face.

212
00:08:03,332 --> 00:08:05,334
It makes you look like a freak.

213
00:08:05,334 --> 00:08:07,336
Oh, you think it looks funny, huh?

214
00:08:07,336 --> 00:08:08,838
I certainly do.

215
00:08:08,838 --> 00:08:10,840
Well, now you know how your moustache
looks to me.

216
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:12,842
Oh, so that's it, huh?

217
00:08:12,842 --> 00:08:15,344
Well, your little gag didn't work.

218
00:08:15,344 --> 00:08:16,846
So just take it off.

219
00:08:16,846 --> 00:08:17,847
Nothing doing.

220
00:08:17,847 --> 00:08:21,350
I'm not taking it off till you shave
off yours.

221
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:22,852
Well, I'm not shaving.

222
00:08:22,852 --> 00:08:26,355
Neither am I.

223
00:08:26,355 --> 00:08:29,358
Of course, we'll have to change our
name to the Smith Brothers.

224
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:32,361
And we could always get

225
00:08:32,361 --> 00:08:34,864
moustache cups marked his and hers.

226
00:08:36,365 --> 00:08:37,867
Now, Lucy, you listen to me.

227
00:08:38,367 --> 00:08:40,369
Now, I'm not going to stand here
and...

228
00:08:47,376 --> 00:08:48,377
I can't stand it.

229
00:08:48,377 --> 00:08:49,378
You win.

230
00:08:49,378 --> 00:08:50,880
Take it off and I'll shave.

231
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:51,881
Good!

232
00:08:51,881 --> 00:08:53,382
Shave right now.

233
00:08:53,382 --> 00:08:55,885
I got it all set up for you.

234
00:08:55,885 --> 00:08:57,887
There you are.

235
00:08:57,887 --> 00:09:01,390
All right, all right.

236
00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:03,392
You've got more eyebrow pencil on
there

237
00:09:03,893 --> 00:09:04,894
than you have whiskers.

238
00:09:05,394 --> 00:09:06,395
Never mind the cracks.

239
00:09:06,395 --> 00:09:07,396
Get it off, now.

240
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:12,902
You missed one right there.

241
00:09:17,406 --> 00:09:20,910
What do you call this one-- Charlie?

242
00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:23,412
There!

243
00:09:23,412 --> 00:09:25,414
Now you look like your old self
again.

244
00:09:25,915 --> 00:09:28,918
Welcome back, little lip.

245
00:09:28,918 --> 00:09:30,419
Give me a great big kiss.

246
00:09:31,921 --> 00:09:33,422
I'm not going to kiss you with that
thing on.

247
00:09:33,923 --> 00:09:36,425
Oh, I forgot.

248
00:09:42,431 --> 00:09:44,934
Gee, this must have been put on

249
00:09:45,434 --> 00:09:47,436
with pretty strong stuff.

250
00:09:47,436 --> 00:09:48,938
Here, let me try, honey.

251
00:09:49,438 --> 00:09:50,439
Ow!

252
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,942
Gosh.

253
00:09:52,942 --> 00:09:54,443
Boy, that's really stuck.

254
00:09:54,443 --> 00:09:57,446
Are you sure you didn't grow this?

255
00:09:59,949 --> 00:10:00,950
I better call Fred

256
00:10:01,450 --> 00:10:03,452
and find out how to get this off.

257
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:11,961
FRED: Hello?

258
00:10:11,961 --> 00:10:13,462
Fred, this is Lucy.

259
00:10:13,462 --> 00:10:15,965
Oh, hi, did the joke come off all
right?

260
00:10:15,965 --> 00:10:17,967
Yeah, the joke did, but the beard
didn't.

261
00:10:18,467 --> 00:10:19,468
Well, what do you mean?

262
00:10:19,969 --> 00:10:22,972
Well, I've tugged and I've pulled and
I can't get it off.

263
00:10:22,972 --> 00:10:23,973
Well, that's funny.

264
00:10:23,973 --> 00:10:25,474
It should come off easy.

265
00:10:25,474 --> 00:10:26,976
I just used a little spirit gum.

266
00:10:27,476 --> 00:10:29,979
Ricky, get me that bottle off the
dresser, will you, dear?

267
00:10:29,979 --> 00:10:30,980
All right, Hon.

268
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:32,481
Fred, y-you shouldn't have used

269
00:10:32,481 --> 00:10:33,482
such old stuff.

270
00:10:33,482 --> 00:10:34,984
Maybe it changes with age.

271
00:10:35,484 --> 00:10:36,485
How long have you had it?

272
00:10:36,485 --> 00:10:39,488
Well, now, let's see, the last date I
played

273
00:10:39,488 --> 00:10:44,493
was a split week in Peoria in 1925.

274
00:10:45,494 --> 00:10:46,996
'25?!

275
00:10:47,496 --> 00:10:48,998
But spirit gum shouldn't change.

276
00:10:49,498 --> 00:10:49,999
Oh.

277
00:10:50,499 --> 00:10:51,500
Here, honey, I've got the bottle.

278
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,002
Thanks, dear.

279
00:10:53,002 --> 00:10:54,003
I have the bottle right here, Fred.

280
00:10:54,003 --> 00:10:57,506
It says "bull dog cement"!

281
00:10:57,506 --> 00:11:00,009
Cement?

282
00:11:00,009 --> 00:11:03,512
Yeah. "Bull dog cement will not let
go, holds fast forever.

283
00:11:03,512 --> 00:11:04,513
"Can only be removed

284
00:11:04,513 --> 00:11:07,516
with bull dog cement remover number
three."

285
00:11:07,516 --> 00:11:08,517
Oh, no.

286
00:11:09,018 --> 00:11:11,020
Oh, yes!

287
00:11:17,526 --> 00:11:21,530
Oh, shut up.

288
00:11:21,530 --> 00:11:24,533
You certainly have a warped sense of
humor.

289
00:11:28,037 --> 00:11:30,539
I'm sorry, honey, I'll ca...

290
00:11:30,539 --> 00:11:32,041
I'll call the...

291
00:11:32,041 --> 00:11:36,045
I'll call the drug store and see if
they got some of that stuff.

292
00:11:37,046 --> 00:11:39,048
They won't have it in a drug store.

293
00:11:39,048 --> 00:11:41,550
They have everything in a drug store.

294
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:43,552
(continues laughing)

295
00:11:49,058 --> 00:11:50,059
Hello.

296
00:11:50,559 --> 00:11:53,562
Listen, have you ever heard of some
stuff

297
00:11:53,562 --> 00:11:57,066
called bull dog cement remover number
three?

298
00:11:57,066 --> 00:11:59,068
You have?

299
00:12:01,070 --> 00:12:02,571
Oh, I see.

300
00:12:02,571 --> 00:12:04,573
Well, thanks.

301
00:12:05,074 --> 00:12:06,575
They don't make it anymore.

302
00:12:12,581 --> 00:12:16,585
You mean... you mean I'll have to
keep this on forever?

303
00:12:16,585 --> 00:12:19,588
Well, honey, I guess it'll wear off
eventually.

304
00:12:19,588 --> 00:12:23,592
Well, what happens in the meantime?

305
00:12:23,592 --> 00:12:24,593
Well, honey

306
00:12:24,593 --> 00:12:26,595
I really should let you suffer

307
00:12:27,096 --> 00:12:29,098
but I don't have the heart to do it.

308
00:12:29,598 --> 00:12:31,100
There's one simple solution

309
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:32,601
and I'll do it for you.

310
00:12:33,102 --> 00:12:34,103
What?

311
00:12:34,603 --> 00:12:37,106
I'll get you job as the bearded lady
in the circus.

312
00:12:37,106 --> 00:12:38,607
Oh.

313
00:12:52,004 --> 00:12:53,506
Lucy?

314
00:12:55,007 --> 00:12:57,009
Lucy?

315
00:12:57,009 --> 00:12:59,512
Where are you?

316
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:09,522
Lucy, I wanted to ask...

317
00:13:09,522 --> 00:13:10,523
Oh, I beg your pardon.

318
00:13:10,523 --> 00:13:12,024
I was looking for...

319
00:13:12,024 --> 00:13:13,526
Good afternoon, ma'am.

320
00:13:15,027 --> 00:13:16,529
Lucy?

321
00:13:16,529 --> 00:13:21,033
Colonel Ricardo, at your beck and
call, you all.

322
00:13:21,033 --> 00:13:24,036
Lucy, what are you doing in those
clothes?

323
00:13:24,036 --> 00:13:26,539
Well, it's the only way I can get
down

324
00:13:26,539 --> 00:13:28,040
to that little old drugstore

325
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:29,542
without people laughing

326
00:13:29,542 --> 00:13:30,543
at little old me.

327
00:13:31,043 --> 00:13:33,546
I thought maybe that little old
druggist

328
00:13:33,546 --> 00:13:34,547
could do something

329
00:13:34,547 --> 00:13:36,048
for this little old face.

330
00:13:36,048 --> 00:13:38,551
Well, how did you all do, Colonel?

331
00:13:38,551 --> 00:13:40,052
Bad, powerful bad.

332
00:13:40,052 --> 00:13:42,555
Oh, you poor little old thing.

333
00:13:42,555 --> 00:13:44,557
Didn't he have any ideas?

334
00:13:44,557 --> 00:13:46,559
Yeah, he said dye the beard red

335
00:13:47,059 --> 00:13:49,061
and the head would match all over.

336
00:13:49,562 --> 00:13:53,065
Oh, what'll I do?

337
00:13:56,068 --> 00:14:00,573
(laughing)

338
00:14:00,573 --> 00:14:02,074
What's the matter?

339
00:14:02,074 --> 00:14:06,078
When you chew with that beard on you
look just like a billy goat.

340
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:10,583
Nobody but a nanny goat would notice
it.

341
00:14:13,085 --> 00:14:15,087
Well!

342
00:14:15,087 --> 00:14:16,088
I've got it.

343
00:14:16,088 --> 00:14:17,089
What?

344
00:14:17,089 --> 00:14:19,091
Nah, you wouldn't go for it.

345
00:14:19,091 --> 00:14:20,092
What is it?

346
00:14:20,092 --> 00:14:22,094
Well...

347
00:14:22,094 --> 00:14:23,596
Nah, you wouldn't like it.

348
00:14:24,096 --> 00:14:25,598
Well, give me a chance.

349
00:14:25,598 --> 00:14:26,599
What is it?

350
00:14:26,599 --> 00:14:29,101
Well, we'll tie a string to your
beard.

351
00:14:29,101 --> 00:14:30,603
Yeah.

352
00:14:30,603 --> 00:14:32,605
Then we'll tie the other end of the
string to a flat iron.

353
00:14:32,605 --> 00:14:34,106
Yeah?
Then I'll throw...

354
00:14:34,106 --> 00:14:36,609
No! Don't throw it.

355
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:38,611
Oh!

356
00:14:38,611 --> 00:14:41,614
I knew you wouldn't like it.

357
00:14:43,115 --> 00:14:45,117
Look out!

358
00:14:47,119 --> 00:14:49,121
Scared me to death.

359
00:15:00,132 --> 00:15:02,635
I think this is safer for little old
me.

360
00:15:02,635 --> 00:15:03,636
Lucy...

361
00:15:03,636 --> 00:15:04,637
What?

362
00:15:04,637 --> 00:15:06,138
You just gave me an idea.

363
00:15:07,139 --> 00:15:08,140
What is it?

364
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:10,142
Well... we'll set fire to your beard

365
00:15:10,142 --> 00:15:11,644
but I'll stand by with a hose

366
00:15:11,644 --> 00:15:13,145
to see that it doesn't get out of
hand.

367
00:15:13,646 --> 00:15:15,147
Ethel, this is my face.

368
00:15:15,147 --> 00:15:18,150
You're not burning weeds off a vacant
lot.

369
00:15:19,151 --> 00:15:20,152
(knock on door)

370
00:15:20,653 --> 00:15:21,654
Who is it?

371
00:15:23,155 --> 00:15:25,157
ETHEL: It's Fred.

372
00:15:25,157 --> 00:15:27,159
LUCY: What do you want?

373
00:15:27,159 --> 00:15:29,161
If I bring good news, can I come in?

374
00:15:29,161 --> 00:15:31,163
All right.

375
00:15:32,164 --> 00:15:33,165
What is it?

376
00:15:33,165 --> 00:15:34,667
I must have made a thousand phone
calls

377
00:15:34,667 --> 00:15:37,169
before I located a drugstore that
sells

378
00:15:37,169 --> 00:15:39,672
bull dog cement remover number three.

379
00:15:39,672 --> 00:15:41,173
Oh, Fred, you doll.

380
00:15:41,173 --> 00:15:43,175
Where is it?

381
00:15:43,175 --> 00:15:45,177
It's in Chicago.

382
00:15:45,678 --> 00:15:46,679
Chicago?

383
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:48,180
Yeah, but he's sending it Air Mail

384
00:15:48,681 --> 00:15:49,682
so it ought to be here tomorrow.

385
00:15:49,682 --> 00:15:50,683
Oh...

386
00:15:51,183 --> 00:15:52,685
Now, Lucy, that's not bad.
No.

387
00:15:52,685 --> 00:15:54,687
(phone rings)

388
00:15:54,687 --> 00:15:55,688
Oh... Chicago.

389
00:15:55,688 --> 00:15:56,689
Hello.

390
00:15:56,689 --> 00:15:59,692
Hello, is Monty Woolley there?

391
00:16:01,193 --> 00:16:03,696
Did you call me up just to make gags?

392
00:16:03,696 --> 00:16:05,197
No, this is important.

393
00:16:05,197 --> 00:16:07,700
You know that talent scout I was
talking to you about?

394
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:08,701
Yeah?

395
00:16:08,701 --> 00:16:09,702
Well, I talked to him today

396
00:16:09,702 --> 00:16:11,203
and I talked him into coming to the
house

397
00:16:11,203 --> 00:16:12,204
to spend an evening with us.

398
00:16:12,204 --> 00:16:14,206
Oh, Ricky, that's wonderful.

399
00:16:14,206 --> 00:16:15,708
Right in our own home.

400
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:16,709
When is he coming?

401
00:16:16,709 --> 00:16:18,210
Tonight.

402
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:19,712
Oh, that...
oh, no, not tonight, Ricky.

403
00:16:20,212 --> 00:16:21,213
Please, not tonight.

404
00:16:21,714 --> 00:16:23,215
Well, honey, he's flying back to
Hollywood tomorrow.

405
00:16:23,215 --> 00:16:25,217
If I don't get him up to the house
tonight

406
00:16:25,217 --> 00:16:26,719
I'll never get a chance to see him
alone.

407
00:16:26,719 --> 00:16:28,220
But, Ricky, what about me?

408
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:31,223
It's my one chance to get into the
movies, too.

409
00:16:31,223 --> 00:16:33,225
My beard, remember? My beard!

410
00:16:33,225 --> 00:16:36,228
Well, I'm sorry, honey, there's
nothing I can do about it.

411
00:16:36,228 --> 00:16:37,229
Oh.

412
00:16:37,229 --> 00:16:39,231
We'll be home about 7:30.
Good-bye.

413
00:16:39,231 --> 00:16:40,232
Good-bye.

414
00:16:40,232 --> 00:16:41,734
Oh, Ricky's bringing

415
00:16:41,734 --> 00:16:43,736
that Hollywood talent scout to the
house tonight.

416
00:16:44,737 --> 00:16:45,738
He is?

417
00:16:45,738 --> 00:16:46,739
No kidding?

418
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:51,744
Uh... Lucy, would you mind if we
dropped in?

419
00:16:51,744 --> 00:16:52,745
No, of course not.

420
00:16:53,245 --> 00:16:54,246
Well, we got to go.

421
00:16:54,246 --> 00:16:55,748
Yeah, see you later!

422
00:17:09,645 --> 00:17:11,764
Here we are, Mr. Murdoch.

423
00:17:11,764 --> 00:17:12,765
Ah.

424
00:17:12,765 --> 00:17:14,767
Let me take your coat.

425
00:17:14,767 --> 00:17:15,768
Oh, thank you.

426
00:17:15,768 --> 00:17:17,269
Make yourself at home, will you?

427
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:19,772
Fine. Well, nice place you have here,
Ricardo.

428
00:17:20,272 --> 00:17:21,273
Thank you.

429
00:17:22,274 --> 00:17:23,275
Sit down.

430
00:17:23,275 --> 00:17:24,777
Thanks.

431
00:17:24,777 --> 00:17:25,778
Boy, I'll be glad

432
00:17:26,278 --> 00:17:28,280
when that picture, Moon over Baghdad

433
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:30,282
is finished with the casting.

434
00:17:30,282 --> 00:17:32,785
Ah... have a cigarette, won't you?

435
00:17:32,785 --> 00:17:34,286
Oh, thank you.

436
00:17:39,291 --> 00:17:41,293
You know, it's nice to spend an
evening someplace else

437
00:17:41,794 --> 00:17:43,295
besides a hotel room or a theater.

438
00:17:43,796 --> 00:17:44,797
Yes, well, that's what I thought.

439
00:17:45,297 --> 00:17:46,298
That's why I asked you to come over
here

440
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:48,300
and get a night off from show
business.

441
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:49,802
Ah, that's sounds good.

442
00:17:49,802 --> 00:17:52,805
Oh!

443
00:17:53,806 --> 00:17:55,307
I wonder how that got here.

444
00:17:55,307 --> 00:17:56,809
What's that?

445
00:17:56,809 --> 00:17:58,310
That's my old scrapbook.

446
00:18:01,313 --> 00:18:02,815
My wife must have been doing

447
00:18:03,315 --> 00:18:04,316
some housecleaning.

448
00:18:04,316 --> 00:18:06,318
I haven't seen this for years.

449
00:18:06,318 --> 00:18:07,319
Well, let's see it.

450
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:08,821
Oh, no, no. This is your night off.

451
00:18:09,321 --> 00:18:10,823
I wouldn't want to bother you with
this.

452
00:18:11,323 --> 00:18:12,324
All right.

453
00:18:12,324 --> 00:18:14,326
This is the first part

454
00:18:14,326 --> 00:18:15,828
that I had in New York--

455
00:18:15,828 --> 00:18:18,330
Broadway play, Too Many Girls.

456
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:19,832
Oh, yeah, yeah.

457
00:18:19,832 --> 00:18:22,334
And, uh, over here's when I was at
the Copacabana.

458
00:18:22,334 --> 00:18:24,336
Oh, it's very interesting.

459
00:18:24,336 --> 00:18:25,337
Now, this...

460
00:18:25,838 --> 00:18:30,342
(singing oriental-style song)

461
00:18:39,852 --> 00:18:41,854
(makes hissing noise)

462
00:18:52,865 --> 00:18:55,367
All right, all right, all right.

463
00:18:55,367 --> 00:18:57,369
That's enough.

464
00:18:57,369 --> 00:18:58,370
Mr. Murdoch

465
00:18:58,370 --> 00:19:00,873
this is our landlord and our
landlady.

466
00:19:00,873 --> 00:19:03,375
Ethel Mertz, former star of musical
comedy.

467
00:19:03,375 --> 00:19:05,377
Can sing, dance, act and do voices;

468
00:19:05,377 --> 00:19:06,879
have wardrobe, will travel.

469
00:19:07,379 --> 00:19:10,382
Freddy Mertz, formerly of Mertz and
Kurtz--

470
00:19:10,883 --> 00:19:11,884
Famous vaudevillians:

471
00:19:12,384 --> 00:19:15,387
Soft shoe, tap dancing and smart
quips.

472
00:19:18,891 --> 00:19:21,393
Uh-uh.

473
00:19:21,393 --> 00:19:22,895
Uh-uh?
Uh-uh?

474
00:19:22,895 --> 00:19:25,397
Uh-uh.

475
00:19:33,906 --> 00:19:34,907
Uh-uh?

476
00:19:34,907 --> 00:19:36,408
Uh-uh.

477
00:19:44,416 --> 00:19:45,918
I'm terribly sorry, Mr. Murdoch.

478
00:19:46,418 --> 00:19:48,420
I must apologize for my friends.

479
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:49,421
Oh, that's all right.

480
00:19:49,922 --> 00:19:52,925
Just please sit down and relax and
enjoy yourself.

481
00:19:52,925 --> 00:19:53,926
I'll put on

482
00:19:53,926 --> 00:19:54,927
a little music here for you.

483
00:19:54,927 --> 00:19:56,428
Fine, fine.

484
00:19:59,431 --> 00:20:05,437
(music plays softly)

485
00:20:05,437 --> 00:20:07,439
Not so far from here

486
00:20:07,439 --> 00:20:10,442
There's a very lively atmosphere

487
00:20:10,442 --> 00:20:13,445
Everybody's going there this year

488
00:20:13,946 --> 00:20:18,951
And there's a reason the season never
closes there

489
00:20:18,951 --> 00:20:21,954
Love and music you'll find everywhere

490
00:20:21,954 --> 00:20:24,456
People always having fun down there

491
00:20:24,456 --> 00:20:25,958
So come along...

492
00:20:27,459 --> 00:20:30,963
I'm on my way to Cuba

493
00:20:30,963 --> 00:20:34,967
That's where I'm going

494
00:20:34,967 --> 00:20:40,472
Cuba, that's where I'll stay

495
00:20:40,472 --> 00:20:46,478
Cuba, where wine is flowing

496
00:20:46,478 --> 00:20:49,982
And where dark-eyed Stellas

497
00:20:49,982 --> 00:20:52,985
Light their fellas' panatelas

498
00:20:53,485 --> 00:20:59,491
Cuba, where it's all happy

499
00:20:59,491 --> 00:21:03,996
Cuba, where all is gay

500
00:21:04,496 --> 00:21:10,002
Why don't you plan a wonderful trip
to Havana?

501
00:21:10,002 --> 00:21:17,009
Hop on a ship and I'll see you in
C-U-B-A

502
00:21:17,509 --> 00:21:25,017
Why don't you plan a wonderful trip
to Havana?

503
00:21:25,017 --> 00:21:37,029
Hop on a ship and I'll see you in
C-U-B-A.

504
00:21:43,035 --> 00:21:45,037
It's, um... very nice.

505
00:21:45,037 --> 00:21:47,039
Uh, Mr. Murdoch, you know

506
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:49,541
we have a lot of other numbers.

507
00:21:49,541 --> 00:21:50,542
No, I... I...

508
00:21:51,043 --> 00:21:52,044
But I could convert some of them

509
00:21:52,044 --> 00:21:53,045
into the Arabian mood, you know.

510
00:21:53,545 --> 00:21:54,046
A little Arabian...

511
00:21:54,546 --> 00:21:58,550
(Arabian music plays)

512
00:22:52,604 --> 00:22:56,108
What is this, a stranded Major Bowes
unit?

513
00:22:59,611 --> 00:23:01,113
Mr. Murdoch, I want you

514
00:23:01,113 --> 00:23:03,115
to meet my wife, Lucy.

515
00:23:03,115 --> 00:23:05,117
Lucy, this is Mr. Murdoch.

516
00:23:05,117 --> 00:23:06,118
How do you do?

517
00:23:06,118 --> 00:23:07,619
Well, I'll say one thing for you,
Mrs. Ricardo.

518
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:09,621
You certainly dance very well.

519
00:23:09,621 --> 00:23:10,622
Oh, thank you.

520
00:23:10,622 --> 00:23:12,624
You know, we could use some dancing
girls

521
00:23:12,624 --> 00:23:13,625
in our new picture.

522
00:23:13,625 --> 00:23:15,127
Maybe we could use you.

523
00:23:15,127 --> 00:23:16,128
Oh, really?

524
00:23:16,628 --> 00:23:17,129
Yeah, I imagine so.

525
00:23:17,629 --> 00:23:18,130
Let me see your face.

526
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:19,631
Oh.

527
00:23:20,132 --> 00:23:21,133
Oh, no, no, no.

528
00:23:21,133 --> 00:23:23,135
It's, uh, it's just a nose, a mouth,
a chin.

529
00:23:23,135 --> 00:23:25,137
You know, a complete set.

530
00:23:25,137 --> 00:23:27,139
Oh, come on, Mrs. Ricardo.

531
00:23:27,139 --> 00:23:28,640
Take off your veil.

532
00:23:29,141 --> 00:23:29,641
Well...

533
00:23:30,142 --> 00:23:31,143
Oh, yeah, come on, Lucy.

534
00:23:31,143 --> 00:23:32,144
Take it off.

535
00:23:33,145 --> 00:23:34,646
You keep out of this.

536
00:23:34,646 --> 00:23:35,647
Come on, Lucy.

537
00:23:35,647 --> 00:23:37,149
Ricky, stay away from me.

538
00:23:37,149 --> 00:23:38,150
Show him your face.

539
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:39,151
Ricky...

540
00:23:39,151 --> 00:23:40,152
This is your big chance.

541
00:23:40,652 --> 00:23:41,653
You know, now I'm getting curious.

542
00:23:42,154 --> 00:23:43,655
I've got to see that face.

543
00:23:43,655 --> 00:23:45,157
Yeah.

544
00:23:53,665 --> 00:23:55,667
All right, all right.

545
00:23:55,667 --> 00:23:57,669
All right.

546
00:23:57,669 --> 00:23:59,671
It's time for the unveiling.

547
00:23:59,671 --> 00:24:01,173
Well, here's my nose.

548
00:24:01,173 --> 00:24:04,176
My mouth is just below it and it has
teeth

549
00:24:04,676 --> 00:24:06,178
and it goes sideways.

550
00:24:06,178 --> 00:24:07,679
All the way.

551
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:09,181
Ricky!

552
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:18,023
RICKY: Hey, honey, look what just got
here.

553
00:24:18,023 --> 00:24:19,024
What?

554
00:24:19,024 --> 00:24:20,525
Special delivery letter from
Hollywood.

555
00:24:20,525 --> 00:24:21,526
What does it say?

556
00:24:21,526 --> 00:24:22,527
What does it say?

557
00:24:22,527 --> 00:24:24,529
Well, wait a minute, wait a minute.

558
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:26,031
Well, what do you know?

559
00:24:26,531 --> 00:24:28,533
They want to test me for the lead.

560
00:24:28,533 --> 00:24:30,035
Oh, Ricky, how wonderful!

561
00:24:30,035 --> 00:24:31,536
Hey, wait a minute.

562
00:24:31,536 --> 00:24:33,038
They want to test you too.

563
00:24:33,038 --> 00:24:35,040
Where? Where? Where?

564
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:38,543
"We think Mrs. Ricardo might be
perfect for..."

565
00:24:39,544 --> 00:24:41,546
I don't care what they pay me.

566
00:24:41,546 --> 00:24:44,549
I'm not going to play the part of
your father.

567
00:24:56,928 --> 00:24:59,814
(theme music playing)

568
00:25:12,827 --> 00:25:17,332
The part of Mr. Murdoch was played by
John Brown.

No!

5
00:00:33,149 --> 00:00:34,651
Really, Marge?

6
00:00:34,651 --> 00:00:38,154
Well, confidentially, I've suspected
that right along.

7
00:00:38,154 --> 00:00:39,155
I have, I have.

8
00:00:39,155 --> 00:00:40,657
You know what I've always thought

9
00:00:40,657 --> 00:00:41,658
about Betty and Jack.

10
00:00:41,658 --> 00:00:42,659
Yeah, well, I've always said

11
00:00:42,659 --> 00:00:44,661
if there was ever anything in the
world...

12
00:00:44,661 --> 00:00:49,165
Lucy, Lucy, for goodness sakes, get
off the phone.

13
00:00:49,165 --> 00:00:51,167
Pardon me, Marge.

14
00:00:51,167 --> 00:00:52,669
Did you say something. Ricky?

15
00:00:52,669 --> 00:00:55,672
Yes, I said, "Lucy, for goodness
sakes, get off the phone."

16
00:00:55,672 --> 00:00:56,673
Oh.

17
00:00:56,673 --> 00:00:58,675
Hello, Marge, bad connection.

18
00:01:00,176 --> 00:01:01,177
Where were we?

19
00:01:01,177 --> 00:01:02,679
Oh, yeah, Betty.

20
00:01:02,679 --> 00:01:05,181
Yeah, uh-huh...

21
00:01:05,181 --> 00:01:07,684
She didn't!

22
00:01:07,684 --> 00:01:09,185
She didn't!

23
00:01:10,186 --> 00:01:12,689
She didn't!

24
00:01:13,189 --> 00:01:14,691
She couldn't!

25
00:01:15,692 --> 00:01:18,194
Maybe that's why she didn't.

26
00:01:23,199 --> 00:01:25,201
Oh, keep quiet.

27
00:01:25,201 --> 00:01:26,703
No, not you, Marge.

28
00:01:26,703 --> 00:01:30,707
Well, honey, I never would have
thought that of Betty.

29
00:01:30,707 --> 00:01:32,208
Oh, good-bye, Marge.

30
00:01:32,208 --> 00:01:35,211
I'm surprised the phone hasn't grown
to your ear.

31
00:01:35,211 --> 00:01:36,713
Oh...

32
00:01:38,214 --> 00:01:39,716
Lucy, why did you stop?

33
00:01:39,716 --> 00:01:43,219
Don't tell me you got tired of taking
Betty apart?

34
00:01:43,219 --> 00:01:44,220
Who got tired?

35
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:45,722
Marge had to hang up.

36
00:01:45,722 --> 00:01:47,724
Betty just walked in.

37
00:01:50,226 --> 00:01:52,729
Gee, I wonder what they're saying
about me.

38
00:01:53,730 --> 00:01:57,734
Lucy, I want to speak to you about
goss'ping.

39
00:01:57,734 --> 00:01:59,736
"Gossping"?

40
00:01:59,736 --> 00:02:02,739
Yes, I think that gossiping is
vicious and petty

41
00:02:02,739 --> 00:02:06,242
and I think a gossip is the lowest
form of human life.

42
00:02:06,242 --> 00:02:08,745
Oh, so do I.

43
00:02:08,745 --> 00:02:11,247
You don't seem to get my message.

44
00:02:12,749 --> 00:02:14,751
I was talking about you.

45
00:02:14,751 --> 00:02:15,752
Me gossip?

46
00:02:15,752 --> 00:02:18,254
What do you call what you were doing
on the phone?

47
00:02:18,254 --> 00:02:19,756
Well, it wasn't gossiping.

48
00:02:19,756 --> 00:02:21,257
I prefer to think of it

49
00:02:21,257 --> 00:02:24,260
as a mutual exchange of vital
information.

50
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:25,261
Ay...

51
00:02:25,261 --> 00:02:26,763
Anyway, she was gossiping.

52
00:02:26,763 --> 00:02:27,764
I was just listening.

53
00:02:27,764 --> 00:02:31,768
Lucy, you remember the old saying

54
00:02:31,768 --> 00:02:34,771
"Birds of a feather smell the same"?

55
00:02:37,774 --> 00:02:41,778
You mean, "A rose by any other name
flocks together."

56
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,782
Yeah.

57
00:02:45,782 --> 00:02:46,783
Well, anyway, I was just listening.

58
00:02:46,783 --> 00:02:49,786
It isn't gossip unless I tell it to
someone else.

59
00:02:49,786 --> 00:02:51,788
Well, that shouldn't take very long.

60
00:02:51,788 --> 00:02:54,791
Are you implying that I can't keep my
mouth shut?

61
00:02:54,791 --> 00:02:55,792
Yeah.

62
00:02:55,792 --> 00:02:57,293
Well, you'll find out.

63
00:02:57,293 --> 00:03:00,296
Nobody's going to get this
information from me.

64
00:03:00,296 --> 00:03:01,297
My lips are sealed.

65
00:03:01,297 --> 00:03:02,799
(snickers)

66
00:03:02,799 --> 00:03:05,802
Uh, Fred and Ethel are coming up
tonight.

67
00:03:05,802 --> 00:03:08,304
I don't care, my lips are sealed.

68
00:03:08,304 --> 00:03:09,806
This I got to see.

69
00:03:09,806 --> 00:03:10,807
You will.

70
00:03:10,807 --> 00:03:12,308
(doorbell buzzing)

71
00:03:12,308 --> 00:03:14,310
Let them in, I'll be right back.

72
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:15,311
All right.

73
00:03:18,314 --> 00:03:19,315
Hi, Ricky.

74
00:03:19,315 --> 00:03:20,316
Hi.

75
00:03:20,316 --> 00:03:21,818
I'm sorry we're late.

76
00:03:21,818 --> 00:03:22,819
I was fixing my hair.

77
00:03:22,819 --> 00:03:24,821
Hey, Rick, is your phone out of
order?

78
00:03:24,821 --> 00:03:26,823
I've been trying to get you for an
hour and a half.

79
00:03:26,823 --> 00:03:28,825
Yeah, well, I know.
Lucy's been on the phone

80
00:03:28,825 --> 00:03:30,827
for an hour and a half talking to
Marge.

81
00:03:30,827 --> 00:03:31,828
Oh.

82
00:03:31,828 --> 00:03:34,831
She's been getting all the details

83
00:03:34,831 --> 00:03:36,833
in some nice, juicy gossip.

84
00:03:36,833 --> 00:03:38,835
Really?

85
00:03:38,835 --> 00:03:41,838
Who was it?
When did it happen?
Who did what?

86
00:03:41,838 --> 00:03:44,841
Oh, come on, Ethel, reel in your
antenna.

87
00:03:47,343 --> 00:03:48,344
Quiet.

88
00:03:48,344 --> 00:03:49,846
Come on, Ricky, give out.

89
00:03:49,846 --> 00:03:51,347
Uh-uh.

90
00:03:51,347 --> 00:03:53,850
Well, Lucy will tell me.

91
00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:55,351
I don't know about that.

92
00:03:55,351 --> 00:03:57,854
She said she wouldn't say a word.

93
00:03:57,854 --> 00:03:59,355
She said her lips are sealed.

94
00:03:59,355 --> 00:04:00,857
Huh?

95
00:04:05,361 --> 00:04:08,364
Oh, boy, I'll say they're sealed.

96
00:04:08,364 --> 00:04:09,866
Hey, I kind of like that.

97
00:04:09,866 --> 00:04:12,869
How come you never went in for one of
those?

98
00:04:12,869 --> 00:04:14,871
Oh, shut up.

99
00:04:14,871 --> 00:04:17,373
Lucy, Ricky says you know

100
00:04:17,373 --> 00:04:19,375
a nice piece of juicy gossip.

101
00:04:19,375 --> 00:04:20,877
Well, tell me.

102
00:04:20,877 --> 00:04:22,378
Oh, darn it!

103
00:04:22,378 --> 00:04:24,380
This is liable to be real good, Fred.

104
00:04:24,881 --> 00:04:26,382
Would you care to join me in a
ringside seat.

105
00:04:26,382 --> 00:04:27,383
Thank you.

106
00:04:28,885 --> 00:04:30,386
ETHEL: Oh, this is maddening.

107
00:04:30,386 --> 00:04:32,889
Who's it about, Lucy?

108
00:04:32,889 --> 00:04:33,890
Madge?

109
00:04:37,393 --> 00:04:38,895
Uh... Blanche?

110
00:04:38,895 --> 00:04:39,896
Um...

111
00:04:39,896 --> 00:04:41,397
Dorothy?

112
00:04:41,397 --> 00:04:43,399
Um...

113
00:04:43,399 --> 00:04:45,401
Luanne?

114
00:04:45,401 --> 00:04:46,402
Uh, Betty?

115
00:04:46,402 --> 00:04:48,404
It's about Betty?

116
00:04:48,404 --> 00:04:49,906
Um...

117
00:04:49,906 --> 00:04:51,407
Uh, Betty and who?

118
00:04:52,909 --> 00:04:54,410
Betty and Fred?

119
00:04:54,410 --> 00:04:55,912
No...

120
00:04:55,912 --> 00:04:57,413
Betty and Ricky?

121
00:04:57,413 --> 00:04:58,915
Oh!

122
00:05:01,918 --> 00:05:03,419
Betty and her husband, Jack!

123
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,922
Oh, Betty and her husband Jack, yeah!

124
00:05:05,922 --> 00:05:06,923
Um...

125
00:05:06,923 --> 00:05:08,925
what happened?

126
00:05:09,926 --> 00:05:11,427
They had a fight?

127
00:05:11,427 --> 00:05:14,430
What did they... what did they fight
about?

128
00:05:16,933 --> 00:05:18,935
A vase?

129
00:05:21,437 --> 00:05:22,939
A woman?

130
00:05:22,939 --> 00:05:24,440
Another woman?

131
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:28,444
Betty and her husband, Jack, had a
fight

132
00:05:28,444 --> 00:05:30,446
about another woman? Oh...

133
00:05:30,446 --> 00:05:31,948
RICKY: Lucy, you promised you wasn't
going

134
00:05:31,948 --> 00:05:33,449
to say anything to Ethel about it.

135
00:05:33,449 --> 00:05:35,451
You're breaking your promise.

136
00:05:35,952 --> 00:05:37,453
I don't care

137
00:05:37,453 --> 00:05:38,955
if you're not saying anything.

138
00:05:38,955 --> 00:05:39,956
You're still gossiping.

139
00:05:39,956 --> 00:05:40,957
Don't stop her now.

140
00:05:41,457 --> 00:05:43,459
I haven't found out what happened.

141
00:05:43,459 --> 00:05:44,961
How did Betty find out

142
00:05:44,961 --> 00:05:46,963
about Jack and the other woman?

143
00:05:49,966 --> 00:05:51,467
Who are you?

144
00:05:51,968 --> 00:05:52,969
A man?

145
00:05:52,969 --> 00:05:53,970
Her husband, Jack!

146
00:05:53,970 --> 00:05:55,972
Yeah, her husband, Jack...

147
00:05:55,972 --> 00:05:56,973
and Betty.

148
00:05:57,473 --> 00:05:57,974
No, no...

149
00:05:58,474 --> 00:05:58,975
the other woman!

150
00:05:59,475 --> 00:06:01,477
Jack and the other woman!

151
00:06:01,978 --> 00:06:03,479
Were out dancing?

152
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,982
And drinking?

153
00:06:06,482 --> 00:06:07,984
(gasps): And kissing?

154
00:06:07,984 --> 00:06:08,985
Oh!

155
00:06:08,985 --> 00:06:10,987
How'd Betty find out about it?

156
00:06:11,487 --> 00:06:12,989
Now, they were dancing...

157
00:06:12,989 --> 00:06:16,993
Yeah, Jack and the other woman are
dancing...

158
00:06:16,993 --> 00:06:18,995
and Betty came in the club...

159
00:06:19,996 --> 00:06:21,497
and saw them!

160
00:06:25,001 --> 00:06:27,503
So she separated them.

161
00:06:27,503 --> 00:06:28,504
Ooh!

162
00:06:32,008 --> 00:06:34,510
Oh!

163
00:06:38,014 --> 00:06:40,016
Oh!

164
00:06:40,016 --> 00:06:42,018
And Jack, Jack, yeah, yeah...

165
00:06:42,018 --> 00:06:45,521
tried to get them to stop fighting,
huh? Yeah...

166
00:06:51,027 --> 00:06:54,030
And they both beat up on him?

167
00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:55,531
Oh!

168
00:06:57,533 --> 00:06:59,035
Now they're all fighting...

169
00:06:59,035 --> 00:07:01,537
all three of them are fighting...

170
00:07:01,537 --> 00:07:04,540
and somebody came in.

171
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:06,542
Uh, the manager?

172
00:07:06,542 --> 00:07:08,544
Uh, the bouncer?

173
00:07:08,544 --> 00:07:09,545
Oh!

174
00:07:09,545 --> 00:07:11,547
The doorman.

175
00:07:12,548 --> 00:07:14,050
RICKY: Uh, uh, uh...

176
00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:15,551
a-a policeman!

177
00:07:15,551 --> 00:07:17,553
A policeman.

178
00:07:37,573 --> 00:07:39,575
He put the girls in the black Maria?

179
00:07:39,575 --> 00:07:40,576
Oh!

180
00:07:46,582 --> 00:07:48,584
Ooh, he threw in Jack!

181
00:07:52,088 --> 00:07:57,093
(Lucy imitating siren)

182
00:07:57,093 --> 00:08:00,096
Oh, what a juicy piece of gossip.

183
00:08:00,096 --> 00:08:02,098
What a performance.

184
00:08:02,098 --> 00:08:03,099
Bravo!

185
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:04,600
Bravo!

186
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,102
Thank you, thank you.

187
00:08:06,102 --> 00:08:08,604
Isn't it amazing what women go
through

188
00:08:08,604 --> 00:08:10,106
to tell each other some dirt?

189
00:08:10,106 --> 00:08:11,107
Fantastic!

190
00:08:11,107 --> 00:08:14,110
Listen, so we gossip a little-- so do
men.

191
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:15,111
FRED: Men gossip?

192
00:08:15,111 --> 00:08:17,113
Yes, men gossip.

193
00:08:17,113 --> 00:08:18,114
Well, now...

194
00:08:18,114 --> 00:08:19,615
Now, wait a minute, Fred.

195
00:08:19,615 --> 00:08:22,618
In all fairness, some men gossip a
little.

196
00:08:22,618 --> 00:08:24,120
Who does?

197
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:26,622
Well, uh, take Marco, my piano
player, for instance.

198
00:08:26,622 --> 00:08:28,124
It was only yesterday

199
00:08:28,124 --> 00:08:30,126
that I caught him talking to the
drummer

200
00:08:30,126 --> 00:08:33,629
about Joe, the trombone player and
what a wolf he is.

201
00:08:33,629 --> 00:08:35,131
Joe, a wolf?

202
00:08:35,131 --> 00:08:36,132
Is he?

203
00:08:36,132 --> 00:08:37,633
(chuckles)

204
00:08:37,633 --> 00:08:39,135
I don't see how he can blow a note

205
00:08:39,135 --> 00:08:40,636
with those fangs of his.

206
00:08:40,636 --> 00:08:42,638
No kidding?

207
00:08:42,638 --> 00:08:44,640
Well, listen, this week is Nancy, the
harpist.

208
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,642
Last week was one of the girls in the
trio.

209
00:08:46,642 --> 00:08:48,644
The week before that, it was the
hat-check girl.

210
00:08:48,644 --> 00:08:49,645
No!

211
00:08:49,645 --> 00:08:50,646
Yeah.

212
00:08:50,646 --> 00:08:54,650
Thank you, Hedda and Lolly.

213
00:08:54,650 --> 00:08:57,653
Now, wait a minute.

214
00:08:57,653 --> 00:09:00,656
The point is we can take it or leave
it alone.

215
00:09:00,656 --> 00:09:03,659
With you women, it's your life's
blood.

216
00:09:03,659 --> 00:09:05,661
Well, you two aren't exactly anemic.

217
00:09:05,661 --> 00:09:07,663
I'll bet you that we can keep from
gossiping

218
00:09:08,164 --> 00:09:09,165
longer than you men can.

219
00:09:09,165 --> 00:09:10,166
Oh, that's a hot one!

220
00:09:10,166 --> 00:09:12,168
Girls, you've made yourself a bet.

221
00:09:12,168 --> 00:09:13,169
Okay, what's the bet?

222
00:09:13,169 --> 00:09:14,670
Well, let's make it something
interesting, now.

223
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:15,671
I know!

224
00:09:15,671 --> 00:09:17,673
The losers will serve the winners

225
00:09:17,673 --> 00:09:19,675
breakfast in bed for a month. How's
that?

226
00:09:19,675 --> 00:09:21,677
Okay, you've got yourself a deal.

227
00:09:21,677 --> 00:09:22,678
All right!

228
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:30,903
Oh, hiya, Fred.

229
00:09:30,903 --> 00:09:32,405
Oh, hi, Rick.

230
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:34,907
Wait a second, I'll walk home with
you.

231
00:09:34,907 --> 00:09:36,409
Ah, I'm glad I saw you.

232
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:37,910
Just coffee.

233
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:39,912
How are things in the gossip front?

234
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:41,414
Well, this is the third day, isn't
it?

235
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:44,917
Yeah, I haven't heard a peep of
gossip out of Lucy.

236
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:47,420
Not a peep out of my biddy either.

237
00:09:48,921 --> 00:09:49,922
Thank you.

238
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:51,924
You know, I have a plan

239
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:54,927
but I think it's a little sneaky.

240
00:09:54,927 --> 00:09:56,929
Good, let's hear it.

241
00:09:56,929 --> 00:09:59,432
Well, I thought maybe we could cook
up

242
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:01,934
some sensational hunk of gossip,
see...

243
00:10:01,934 --> 00:10:03,436
Uh-huh?

244
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:05,438
And then we tell it to our wives

245
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:08,941
and leave them alone and wait for
them to explode.

246
00:10:08,941 --> 00:10:11,944
Well, there will be an explosion, all
right

247
00:10:11,944 --> 00:10:12,945
except for one thing.

248
00:10:12,945 --> 00:10:14,447
What's that?

249
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:16,949
If we tell them, then we'll be
gossiping.

250
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:18,951
Oh, yeah, I didn't think of that.

251
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:21,954
It was a nice try, though-- good try.

252
00:10:24,957 --> 00:10:26,459
Listen.

253
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:27,960
Huh?

254
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:33,466
Supposing that, accidentally, we
mumbled something in our sleep

255
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:35,468
and our wives overheard it.

256
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:36,969
We couldn't be accused

257
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:38,471
of gossiping then, could we?

258
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:39,472
Well, no...

259
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:40,973
but what with...

260
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:44,977
oh, you mean we-we pretend that we're
talking in our sleep?

261
00:10:44,977 --> 00:10:45,928
You got me.

262
00:10:45,928 --> 00:10:47,930
Ricky, you're a Cuban genius.

263
00:10:47,930 --> 00:10:48,931
Thank you.

264
00:10:48,931 --> 00:10:49,932
Now, let's see...

265
00:10:49,932 --> 00:10:52,435
who will we make up the story about?

266
00:10:52,435 --> 00:10:53,936
Well, what about...

267
00:10:53,936 --> 00:10:54,937
wait a minute, now.

268
00:10:54,937 --> 00:10:57,940
What about the Foster woman, the
blonde in 3-B?

269
00:10:57,940 --> 00:11:00,943
They're both jealous of her looks
anyway.

270
00:11:00,943 --> 00:11:01,944
Yeah, Grace Foster.

271
00:11:01,944 --> 00:11:02,945
Yeah.

272
00:11:02,945 --> 00:11:04,447
That's good, that's good.

273
00:11:04,447 --> 00:11:05,948
Grace Foster and who?

274
00:11:06,449 --> 00:11:08,451
The milkman.

275
00:11:08,951 --> 00:11:09,452
The milkman?

276
00:11:09,452 --> 00:11:10,453
Yes.

277
00:11:10,453 --> 00:11:11,954
That little, bitty guy?

278
00:11:11,954 --> 00:11:12,955
Yeah.

279
00:11:14,457 --> 00:11:15,958
He's so bashful.

280
00:11:15,958 --> 00:11:17,960
That makes it all the juicier.

281
00:11:37,329 --> 00:11:39,832
(snoring)

282
00:11:39,832 --> 00:11:41,834
Grace Foster.

283
00:11:44,336 --> 00:11:45,838
(snoring)

284
00:11:45,838 --> 00:11:47,840
Grace Foster.

285
00:11:51,343 --> 00:11:52,344
(snores loudly)

286
00:11:52,344 --> 00:11:54,346
Grace Foster!

287
00:11:58,350 --> 00:12:04,356
(moaning)

288
00:12:04,356 --> 00:12:05,858
Huh? What's the matter?

289
00:12:05,858 --> 00:12:07,860
What's the matter, Ricky?

290
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:09,862
(snoring)

291
00:12:09,862 --> 00:12:12,364
Oh, you must have had a nightmare.

292
00:12:13,866 --> 00:12:16,368
Sleep well, little husband.

293
00:12:16,368 --> 00:12:18,871
(snoring)

294
00:12:18,871 --> 00:12:21,373
Grace Foster.

295
00:12:24,877 --> 00:12:26,378
Grace Foster?

296
00:12:29,381 --> 00:12:31,884
What about Grace Foster?

297
00:12:32,384 --> 00:12:34,386
What are you dreaming about?

298
00:12:34,386 --> 00:12:37,389
Why are you smiling like that?

299
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:40,392
What about Grace Foster?

300
00:12:42,394 --> 00:12:44,897
Grace Foster is running away.

301
00:12:44,897 --> 00:12:46,899
(snoring)

302
00:12:46,899 --> 00:12:50,402
Grace Foster is running away with...

303
00:12:54,406 --> 00:12:56,408
Don't stop now.

304
00:12:56,408 --> 00:12:57,409
Go on.

305
00:12:57,409 --> 00:12:58,911
(snoring)

306
00:12:58,911 --> 00:13:01,914
Grace Foster is running away with the
milkman.

307
00:13:01,914 --> 00:13:02,915
The milkman?

308
00:13:02,915 --> 00:13:05,417
Uh-huh.

309
00:13:08,921 --> 00:13:11,924
Go on, go on.

310
00:13:12,424 --> 00:13:13,926
Grace Foster y el lechero

311
00:13:13,926 --> 00:13:15,928
se van a salir juntos...

312
00:13:15,928 --> 00:13:17,930
In English, in English!

313
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:20,432
(snoring)

314
00:13:20,933 --> 00:13:23,936
Grace Foster is running away with the
milkman

315
00:13:23,936 --> 00:13:26,438
and her husband doesn't suspect
anything.

316
00:13:26,939 --> 00:13:27,940
Go on.

317
00:13:29,942 --> 00:13:31,443
That is all.

318
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:40,953
Ooh, Ethel will die when she hears
this.

319
00:13:40,953 --> 00:13:43,956
I can't keep it to myself another
minute.

320
00:13:43,956 --> 00:13:45,958
I'll call her right now.

321
00:13:50,462 --> 00:13:51,964
Gee, it's pretty late.

322
00:13:51,964 --> 00:13:53,966
I wonder what time it is.

323
00:13:57,469 --> 00:13:58,971
4:00.

324
00:13:59,972 --> 00:14:03,475
Well, she might still be up.

325
00:14:08,981 --> 00:14:11,984
I can't tell her without losing that
bet.

326
00:14:11,984 --> 00:14:14,486
It would be gossip.

327
00:14:14,486 --> 00:14:15,487
Darn it!

328
00:14:15,487 --> 00:14:19,491
(Ricky snoring)

329
00:14:25,998 --> 00:14:29,001
That's right, sleep, you big ox.

330
00:14:30,469 --> 00:14:31,470
What? What?

331
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:32,471
What happened? What?
What happened?

332
00:14:32,471 --> 00:14:34,974
You must have been dreaming, dear.

333
00:14:34,974 --> 00:14:35,975
Oh... oh.

334
00:14:37,476 --> 00:14:38,978
Good night, dear.

335
00:14:38,978 --> 00:14:39,979
Good night.

336
00:14:41,981 --> 00:14:44,984
(laughing to himself)

337
00:14:44,984 --> 00:14:47,987
I'm a real stinker, all right.

338
00:14:52,074 --> 00:14:53,075
Ricky!

339
00:14:57,079 --> 00:14:58,581
Ricky!

340
00:14:58,581 --> 00:14:59,582
Hello, Fred.

341
00:15:03,085 --> 00:15:05,087
How did it go last night?

342
00:15:05,087 --> 00:15:06,088
Wonderful.

343
00:15:06,088 --> 00:15:08,090
She swallowed the whole story.

344
00:15:08,090 --> 00:15:10,092
How did it go with Ethel?

345
00:15:10,092 --> 00:15:12,094
Well, if she'd have flapped her ears
any more

346
00:15:12,595 --> 00:15:14,597
she would have taken off

347
00:15:14,597 --> 00:15:15,598
and circled the room.

348
00:15:15,598 --> 00:15:18,100
Listen, we're a cinch to win the bet.

349
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:19,101
How do you know?

350
00:15:19,101 --> 00:15:20,102
Well, Lucy just announced

351
00:15:20,102 --> 00:15:22,104
that she's going to go downstairs

352
00:15:22,104 --> 00:15:24,106
and borrow a cup of flour from Ethel.

353
00:15:24,106 --> 00:15:26,108
Well, let's not waste any more time.

354
00:15:26,108 --> 00:15:27,610
Where are we going?

355
00:15:27,610 --> 00:15:29,111
We'll go down to the basement

356
00:15:29,111 --> 00:15:30,613
and listen through the furnace pipe.

357
00:15:30,613 --> 00:15:31,614
Good idea.

358
00:15:31,614 --> 00:15:32,615
Come on!

359
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:41,624
Ricky, I'm going downstairs now.

360
00:15:41,624 --> 00:15:43,125
Ricky?

361
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:49,131
Oh.
Oh.

362
00:15:49,131 --> 00:15:50,633
I just came up to borrow a cup of
sugar.

363
00:15:51,133 --> 00:15:53,135
I was just coming down to borrow a
cup of flour.

364
00:15:53,135 --> 00:15:54,136
Well, come on in, sit down.

365
00:15:54,136 --> 00:15:55,137
Okay.

366
00:15:59,141 --> 00:16:00,643
How about a cup of coffee?

367
00:16:00,643 --> 00:16:02,144
Uh, no, thanks.

368
00:16:09,652 --> 00:16:11,153
Um...

369
00:16:11,153 --> 00:16:13,155
how have you been?

370
00:16:13,155 --> 00:16:14,657
Oh, I've been fine, fine.

371
00:16:14,657 --> 00:16:17,159
I feel wonderful.

372
00:16:17,159 --> 00:16:18,160
How have you been?

373
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,663
Great, great, never felt better.

374
00:16:22,665 --> 00:16:24,667
Well, let's drink to our good health.

375
00:16:30,172 --> 00:16:31,173
What's new?

376
00:16:31,173 --> 00:16:33,175
Um, uh...

377
00:16:36,679 --> 00:16:38,681
Nothing.

378
00:16:38,681 --> 00:16:40,683
What's new with you?

379
00:16:40,683 --> 00:16:42,685
Nothing.

380
00:16:44,186 --> 00:16:46,689
(both sigh)

381
00:16:46,689 --> 00:16:48,190
Dull, aren't we?

382
00:16:48,190 --> 00:16:49,191
Yeah.

383
00:16:50,693 --> 00:16:52,695
Well, I might as well go home.

384
00:16:52,695 --> 00:16:54,697
How about your sugar?

385
00:16:54,697 --> 00:16:55,698
Sugar?

386
00:16:55,698 --> 00:16:57,700
Oh, never mind.

387
00:16:57,700 --> 00:17:00,202
I really didn't need any flour
either.

388
00:17:00,202 --> 00:17:01,203
Well, so long.

389
00:17:01,203 --> 00:17:02,204
Bye.

390
00:17:02,204 --> 00:17:03,706
Drop up later, Ethel.

391
00:17:03,706 --> 00:17:05,207
I got a pudding in the oven.

392
00:17:05,207 --> 00:17:06,208
Pudding?

393
00:17:06,208 --> 00:17:07,209
What kind?

394
00:17:07,209 --> 00:17:09,211
Grace Foster...
I mean, brown betty!

395
00:17:09,211 --> 00:17:10,713
You know then!

396
00:17:10,713 --> 00:17:11,714
Yes, do you?

397
00:17:11,714 --> 00:17:12,715
Yes!

398
00:17:13,716 --> 00:17:15,718
Ricky, are you in there?

399
00:17:19,722 --> 00:17:21,223
What did you hear?

400
00:17:21,223 --> 00:17:22,725
I heard that Grace is getting ready

401
00:17:22,725 --> 00:17:24,226
to run away with the milkman!

402
00:17:24,226 --> 00:17:26,228
They're going to Mexico and get a
quick divorce

403
00:17:26,228 --> 00:17:27,229
and they're settling in Steubenville.

404
00:17:27,229 --> 00:17:29,231
Steubenville?!

405
00:17:29,231 --> 00:17:30,733
Yeah, he's got a new milk route.

406
00:17:30,733 --> 00:17:34,236
Well, if you ask me, I think her
husband is well rid of her.

407
00:17:34,236 --> 00:17:36,238
I think so too.

408
00:17:36,238 --> 00:17:37,740
I think so too.

409
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:40,743
FRED (eerily): Ethel Mertz!

410
00:17:40,743 --> 00:17:42,244
BOTH: What's that?

411
00:17:42,244 --> 00:17:45,748
You ought to be ashamed of yourself.

412
00:17:45,748 --> 00:17:46,749
Who's that?

413
00:17:46,749 --> 00:17:50,252
This is your conscience.

414
00:17:50,252 --> 00:17:53,255
You have been gossiping.

415
00:17:53,255 --> 00:17:56,759
Ethel, you've got the loudest
conscience I ever heard.

416
00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:01,764
RICKY: Lucy Ricardo!

417
00:18:01,764 --> 00:18:04,767
This is your conscience.

418
00:18:04,767 --> 00:18:07,770
You've been goss'ping, too.

419
00:18:07,770 --> 00:18:10,773
Oh, fine, my conscience has an
accent.

420
00:18:12,775 --> 00:18:14,777
Ricky Ricardo, where are you?

421
00:18:14,777 --> 00:18:17,279
Fred and I are down in the basement.

422
00:18:17,279 --> 00:18:18,781
We listened to the whole thing

423
00:18:18,781 --> 00:18:20,282
through the furnace pipe.

424
00:18:20,282 --> 00:18:22,785
FRED: Looks like you've lost the bet,
girls.

425
00:18:22,785 --> 00:18:24,286
Oh!

426
00:18:24,286 --> 00:18:25,788
Keep them talking.

427
00:18:25,788 --> 00:18:27,790
What are you doing down there now?

428
00:18:27,790 --> 00:18:31,794
FRED: We knew you'd blab that phony
Grace Foster story

429
00:18:31,794 --> 00:18:32,795
to each other.

430
00:18:32,795 --> 00:18:33,796
Phony?

431
00:18:33,796 --> 00:18:35,297
RICKY: Yes, we dreamt it up

432
00:18:35,798 --> 00:18:38,300
and told it to you last night in our
sleep.

433
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:42,805
(gasping and coughing)

434
00:18:42,805 --> 00:18:45,808
There! Maybe a little soot will teach
them

435
00:18:45,808 --> 00:18:46,809
not to be so smart next time.

436
00:18:46,809 --> 00:18:48,811
How do you like that?

437
00:18:48,811 --> 00:18:50,813
They deliberately tricked us.

438
00:18:50,813 --> 00:18:52,815
What a couple of fools we are.

439
00:18:52,815 --> 00:18:55,317
Now we got to give those two bums

440
00:18:55,317 --> 00:18:57,319
breakfast in bed for a month.

441
00:18:57,319 --> 00:18:59,321
What a revolting thought.

442
00:18:59,321 --> 00:19:00,322
Wait a minute!

443
00:19:00,322 --> 00:19:03,325
If they weren't asleep, they were
awake.

444
00:19:03,325 --> 00:19:07,329
Well, that's a monumental conclusion.

445
00:19:07,329 --> 00:19:09,832
No, no, I mean if they were awake

446
00:19:09,832 --> 00:19:11,834
when they told us that story

447
00:19:12,334 --> 00:19:13,836
they were gossiping.

448
00:19:13,836 --> 00:19:14,837
Yeah!

449
00:19:14,837 --> 00:19:16,839
How about that?

450
00:19:16,839 --> 00:19:20,843
Suddenly the breakfast is on the
other foot.

451
00:19:25,347 --> 00:19:28,851
Well, if it isn't the coal dust
twins.

452
00:19:29,852 --> 00:19:31,353
Very funny.

453
00:19:31,353 --> 00:19:35,357
All right, girls, we won the bet fair
and square.

454
00:19:35,357 --> 00:19:36,358
Didn't we, Fred?

455
00:19:36,358 --> 00:19:37,359
That we did.

456
00:19:37,359 --> 00:19:39,361
Now, let's see...

457
00:19:39,361 --> 00:19:42,865
tomorrow morning I would like some
orange juice

458
00:19:42,865 --> 00:19:48,370
two eggs basted, ham, toast, jam and
coffee.

459
00:19:48,370 --> 00:19:50,372
I'll have the same, sweetie.

460
00:19:50,372 --> 00:19:51,373
Well, that's just wonderful

461
00:19:51,373 --> 00:19:53,876
except for tomorrow morning, you'll
be serving it to us.

462
00:19:53,876 --> 00:19:55,377
She is so right.

463
00:19:55,377 --> 00:19:57,379
FRED AND RICKY: What do you mean?

464
00:19:57,379 --> 00:20:00,883
I mean you weren't really talking in
your sleep

465
00:20:00,883 --> 00:20:02,885
so you were gossiping first!

466
00:20:02,885 --> 00:20:05,387
Now, wait a minute, girls, wait a
minute.

467
00:20:05,387 --> 00:20:06,889
You have misconstrued

468
00:20:06,889 --> 00:20:09,391
the entire point of the situation.

469
00:20:09,391 --> 00:20:11,393
Now, you see, if the story were true

470
00:20:11,393 --> 00:20:13,395
then we would have been gossiping

471
00:20:13,395 --> 00:20:15,397
but the story was not true--

472
00:20:15,397 --> 00:20:16,398
we made it up.

473
00:20:16,398 --> 00:20:18,400
The whole thing was "friction"

474
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,903
so we were not gossiping.

475
00:20:20,903 --> 00:20:23,906
Now, you girls believed that the
story was true

476
00:20:23,906 --> 00:20:25,407
so you were gossiping.

477
00:20:25,407 --> 00:20:27,409
Now, that's the whole thing.

478
00:20:27,409 --> 00:20:28,410
Oh, that is the silliest way

479
00:20:28,410 --> 00:20:29,912
of trying to crawl out of a bet....

480
00:20:29,912 --> 00:20:31,413
What do you mean, "friction"?

481
00:20:31,413 --> 00:20:32,414
Wait a minute!

482
00:20:32,414 --> 00:20:33,415
(all arguing)

483
00:20:39,037 --> 00:20:42,040
Good morning, your majesty.

484
00:20:43,041 --> 00:20:44,543
Good morning.

485
00:20:45,043 --> 00:20:45,544
That's nice.

486
00:20:46,044 --> 00:20:47,045
You're a very good wife.

487
00:20:47,546 --> 00:20:48,547
Thank you very much.

488
00:20:48,547 --> 00:20:50,048
Thank you.

489
00:20:50,048 --> 00:20:52,551
FRED: Ricky, don't start till I get
there!

490
00:20:57,055 --> 00:20:59,057
Fred, what are you doing up here?

491
00:20:59,057 --> 00:21:02,561
Well, I thought we ought to share our
moment of triumph.

492
00:21:02,561 --> 00:21:03,562
May I?

493
00:21:03,562 --> 00:21:04,563
Be my guest.

494
00:21:08,567 --> 00:21:10,569
Where are you, Ethel?

495
00:21:10,569 --> 00:21:13,071
Coming, master.

496
00:21:18,577 --> 00:21:20,579
This is the life, isn't it, Fred?

497
00:21:20,579 --> 00:21:22,581
We're living like kings.

498
00:21:22,581 --> 00:21:26,084
Why did you ever agree that they won
the bet?

499
00:21:26,084 --> 00:21:28,086
Well, Ethel, it would be different

500
00:21:28,086 --> 00:21:29,588
if that story about Grace Foster

501
00:21:29,588 --> 00:21:31,590
and the milkman was true, but it
wasn't.

502
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:33,091
That's right.

503
00:21:33,091 --> 00:21:34,092
Absolutely.

504
00:21:34,092 --> 00:21:35,594
MAN: Help! Help! Save me! Help!

505
00:21:35,594 --> 00:21:36,595
What's this?
Who's that?

506
00:21:36,595 --> 00:21:39,097
Save me!
He's after me, he's after me!

507
00:21:39,097 --> 00:21:40,098
Who's after you?

508
00:21:40,098 --> 00:21:42,601
Oh, all my milk will turn sour.

509
00:21:42,601 --> 00:21:43,602
He's after me!
Who's after you?
Who's after you?

510
00:21:43,602 --> 00:21:44,603
Who's that?

511
00:21:44,603 --> 00:21:45,604
Mr. Foster, Mr. Foster!

512
00:21:45,604 --> 00:21:46,605
ETHEL: Mr. Foster?!

513
00:21:46,605 --> 00:21:48,106
Where can I hide?

514
00:21:48,106 --> 00:21:49,107
In there.
Oh...

515
00:21:49,107 --> 00:21:51,109
MR. FOSTER: All right, where is
that...?

516
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:52,611
ETHEL: Oh, help hide him, Lucy.

517
00:21:52,611 --> 00:21:53,612
RICKY: What's going on here?

518
00:21:53,612 --> 00:21:55,614
MR. FOSTER: Just watch me get my
hands on that little shrimp!

519
00:21:55,614 --> 00:21:58,116
That's all I want to do is find him!

520
00:21:58,116 --> 00:21:59,618
What do you mean breaking in here?

521
00:22:00,118 --> 00:22:01,119
What's going on here, Mr. Foster?

522
00:22:01,119 --> 00:22:03,121
I'll teach that cow juice peddler

523
00:22:03,121 --> 00:22:04,623
to flirt with my wife.

524
00:22:04,623 --> 00:22:07,125
Come on out, you cottage cheese
Casanova!

525
00:22:07,125 --> 00:22:09,628
What you doing there, you little
shrimp...

526
00:22:09,628 --> 00:22:12,130
(everybody yelling)

527
00:22:12,130 --> 00:22:16,134
Mr. Foster, now, now nothing can be
settled with a gun.

528
00:22:16,635 --> 00:22:17,135
No?

529
00:22:17,636 --> 00:22:19,137
You'll just go to jail.

530
00:22:19,137 --> 00:22:20,138
Wow.

531
00:22:20,138 --> 00:22:22,641
Now, you don't want to go to jail, do
you?

532
00:22:22,641 --> 00:22:23,642
No.

533
00:22:23,642 --> 00:22:26,645
Now... now, this is something that
should be settled

534
00:22:26,645 --> 00:22:28,647
between you and your wife, Grace.

535
00:22:28,647 --> 00:22:32,150
Yeah, I guess shooting him wouldn't
solve anything.

536
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:33,652
It certainly wouldn't.

537
00:22:33,652 --> 00:22:35,654
I suppose maybe I ought to give Grace

538
00:22:35,654 --> 00:22:36,655
a chance to explain.

539
00:22:36,655 --> 00:22:37,656
That's right.

540
00:22:37,656 --> 00:22:39,157
Yeah.

541
00:22:41,159 --> 00:22:43,161
But let me tell you one thing.

542
00:22:43,161 --> 00:22:45,664
From now on, we drink goat's milk.

543
00:22:55,173 --> 00:22:58,677
So there's no truth to the story,
hey, fellas?

544
00:22:59,177 --> 00:23:02,180
ETHEL: Yeah, how about that, boys?

545
00:23:20,699 --> 00:23:21,700
Oh, no, you don't.

546
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:24,703
I'll have honeydew melon filled with
strawberries

547
00:23:24,703 --> 00:23:26,705
eggs Benedict and hot chocolate.

548
00:23:26,705 --> 00:23:29,207
I'll have the same, Fatso.

549
00:23:35,213 --> 00:23:38,216
Eso es lo que quiere comer para el
desayuno--

550
00:23:38,216 --> 00:23:41,219
un pedazo de honeydew melon, Benedict
eggs

551
00:23:41,219 --> 00:23:43,221
filled with strawberry

552
00:23:43,221 --> 00:23:44,723
y chocolate caliente...

553
00:23:49,728 --> 00:23:51,229
(clears throat)

554
00:23:51,730 --> 00:23:53,231
Oh, I forgot all about you.

555
00:23:53,231 --> 00:23:54,733
You're safe now.

556
00:23:54,733 --> 00:23:55,734
ETHEL: What a break

557
00:23:55,734 --> 00:23:58,236
he chose this apartment to hide in.

558
00:23:58,236 --> 00:24:00,238
Would you hand me my purse there
please?

559
00:24:00,238 --> 00:24:01,239
Oh.

560
00:24:01,239 --> 00:24:02,741
Thank you.

561
00:24:02,741 --> 00:24:04,743
Now, here's five dollars for you

562
00:24:04,743 --> 00:24:07,746
and please give this five dollars to
Mr. Foster

563
00:24:07,746 --> 00:24:10,248
and tell him I said, "thank you very
much."

564
00:24:10,749 --> 00:24:12,751
You both gave wonderful performances.

565
00:24:12,751 --> 00:24:16,755
Aw, think nothing of it, Mrs.
Ricardo.

566
00:24:17,255 --> 00:24:19,758
Oh, with my compliments.

567
00:24:19,758 --> 00:24:21,760
Oh, thank you.

568
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,261
It was a pleasure.

569
00:24:24,262 --> 00:24:25,263
Any time.

570
00:24:25,263 --> 00:24:26,765
LUCY: Bye-bye.

572
00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:53,692
The part of the milkman

573
00:24:53,692 --> 00:24:55,694
was played by Bobby Jellison.

574
00:24:55,694 --> 00:24:58,196
Mr. Foster was played by Dick Reeves.

Thank you.

Hi.

Did you tell Ricky yet?

00:00:44,944 --> 00:00:46,446
Uh-huh.

10
00:00:46,446 --> 00:00:47,947
Oh, I can hardly wait.

11
00:00:47,947 --> 00:00:51,451
Imagine us being members of the
Society Matrons League.

12
00:00:51,451 --> 00:00:53,953
Mm, I don't see how you got up nerve
enough

13
00:00:53,953 --> 00:00:55,455
to send in the application.

14
00:00:55,955 --> 00:00:57,957
Why not? It's just another club.

15
00:00:57,957 --> 00:00:59,459
Just another club?

16
00:00:59,459 --> 00:01:01,461
They're the cream of society.

17
00:01:01,461 --> 00:01:03,463
Well, we'll fit in perfectly.

18
00:01:03,463 --> 00:01:06,466
(in English accent): "How do you do,
Mrs. Mertz?

19
00:01:06,466 --> 00:01:08,468
It's so good to see you, my dear."

20
00:01:08,468 --> 00:01:09,469
"How do you do?"

21
00:01:09,469 --> 00:01:10,470
"Eh, how do you do?"

22
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:11,971
(mocking laughter)

23
00:01:11,971 --> 00:01:13,473
Oh, dear.

24
00:01:13,473 --> 00:01:14,474
What's the matter?

25
00:01:14,474 --> 00:01:15,975
Do you suppose when we're introduced

26
00:01:15,975 --> 00:01:17,477
to those society- type husbands

27
00:01:17,477 --> 00:01:18,978
they'll try to kiss our hands?

28
00:01:19,479 --> 00:01:21,981
Well, if they kiss mine, they'll get
dishpan lips.

29
00:01:21,981 --> 00:01:24,484
Boy, I don't know how many dishes
I've washed

30
00:01:24,484 --> 00:01:25,985
since we've been married.

31
00:01:25,985 --> 00:01:27,487
I don't either.

32
00:01:27,487 --> 00:01:30,990
Let's see-- 20 dishes a meal, three
meals a day

33
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:35,495
306... I'm going to figure this out.

34
00:01:35,495 --> 00:01:37,497
20 dishes a meal

35
00:01:37,497 --> 00:01:42,001
three meals a day...
365 days a year...

36
00:01:42,001 --> 00:01:45,505
uh, four, five...
two, three, four.

37
00:01:45,505 --> 00:01:49,509
We've been married for ten years.

38
00:01:49,509 --> 00:01:53,513
219,000 dishes!

39
00:01:53,513 --> 00:01:54,514
No kidding?

40
00:01:54,514 --> 00:01:56,015
How about that!

41
00:01:56,015 --> 00:01:57,517
Come on, Mrs. Mertz.

42
00:01:57,517 --> 00:01:59,018
Where are we going?

43
00:01:59,018 --> 00:02:00,520
We're going to revolt.

44
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:02,522
We are going in there and demand

45
00:02:02,522 --> 00:02:05,525
that our husbands buy us electric
dishwashers.

46
00:02:05,525 --> 00:02:06,526
I'm with you.

47
00:02:06,526 --> 00:02:08,528
Don't you ever throw anything but
deuces?

48
00:02:11,531 --> 00:02:12,532
Ricky?

49
00:02:12,532 --> 00:02:13,533
Fred?

50
00:02:13,533 --> 00:02:15,535
We're revolting.

51
00:02:15,535 --> 00:02:17,537
No more than usual.

52
00:02:22,542 --> 00:02:23,543
We didn't mean that.

53
00:02:23,543 --> 00:02:25,545
Now, listen, Ricky, I just figured
this out.

54
00:02:25,545 --> 00:02:28,047
Since you and I have been married

55
00:02:28,047 --> 00:02:30,049
I have washed 219,000 dishes.

56
00:02:30,049 --> 00:02:31,050
No!

57
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:33,553
You can imagine how many I've washed.

58
00:02:33,553 --> 00:02:36,055
Yeah, must be up in the millions!

59
00:02:36,055 --> 00:02:37,557
Lucy!

60
00:02:37,557 --> 00:02:40,560
Well, I was just trying to make a
point.

61
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,561
Oh.

62
00:02:41,561 --> 00:02:42,562
Would you mind telling us

63
00:02:42,562 --> 00:02:44,063
what this is all leading up to?

64
00:02:44,063 --> 00:02:45,064
Gladly.

65
00:02:45,064 --> 00:02:46,566
There's a wonderful invention on the
market

66
00:02:46,566 --> 00:02:48,067
that makes it impossible

67
00:02:48,067 --> 00:02:50,570
for about-to-be society matrons like
us

68
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:53,072
to get rough, red hands in dishwater

69
00:02:53,072 --> 00:02:54,574
and we think it would be

70
00:02:54,574 --> 00:02:56,576
a wonderful, wonderful investment.

71
00:02:56,576 --> 00:02:58,077
Well, so do I.

72
00:02:58,077 --> 00:02:59,078
You do!?

73
00:02:59,078 --> 00:03:00,580
Certainly.
Hey!

74
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:04,083
They want us to buy them some rubber
gloves.

75
00:03:06,586 --> 00:03:10,089
I had reference to an automatic
dishwasher.

76
00:03:10,089 --> 00:03:11,574
Well, forget it, honey.

77
00:03:11,574 --> 00:03:12,575
Why?

78
00:03:12,575 --> 00:03:13,576
I can't afford it.

79
00:03:13,576 --> 00:03:16,079
I can't even afford rubber gloves.

80
00:03:16,079 --> 00:03:18,581
Oh, well, nice try, Lucy.

81
00:03:18,581 --> 00:03:19,582
Oh!

82
00:03:20,583 --> 00:03:22,085
RICKY: Isn't it amazing

83
00:03:22,085 --> 00:03:24,087
how spoiled modern women are?

84
00:03:24,087 --> 00:03:25,088
Spoiled?

85
00:03:25,088 --> 00:03:26,089
Yes, spoiled.

86
00:03:26,089 --> 00:03:28,091
You got to do a little work

87
00:03:28,091 --> 00:03:29,092
and you think it's terrible.

88
00:03:29,592 --> 00:03:30,093
A little work!

89
00:03:30,593 --> 00:03:32,095
Why, honey, this is the electric age.

90
00:03:32,095 --> 00:03:34,097
All you have to do is flip a swish.

91
00:03:39,102 --> 00:03:42,105
We flip a "swish."

92
00:03:42,105 --> 00:03:43,606
Listen, your grandmothers didn't have

93
00:03:44,107 --> 00:03:45,608
any of these modern electrical
conveniences

94
00:03:45,608 --> 00:03:47,610
and they not only washed the dishes

95
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:49,612
but they swept the floor, they
churned the butter

96
00:03:49,612 --> 00:03:52,115
they baked the bread, they did the
laundry

97
00:03:52,115 --> 00:03:54,117
and they made their own clothes.

98
00:03:54,117 --> 00:03:56,119
Sure. Where are those women today?

99
00:03:56,119 --> 00:03:58,621
Dead.

100
00:03:58,621 --> 00:04:00,123
You know what I mean.

101
00:04:00,123 --> 00:04:02,625
I'd like to see you girls run the
house

102
00:04:02,625 --> 00:04:04,127
without any of these modern
conveniences.

103
00:04:04,627 --> 00:04:05,128
Well, what about you guys?

104
00:04:05,628 --> 00:04:06,629
Yeah. You couldn't get along with
them

105
00:04:06,629 --> 00:04:07,630
any better than we could.

106
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:10,133
Aw, honey, we're men, we're rugged.

107
00:04:10,133 --> 00:04:11,634
Yeah!

108
00:04:11,634 --> 00:04:12,635
They're rugged.

109
00:04:12,635 --> 00:04:15,138
Why don't you put your money where
your big mouth is.

110
00:04:15,138 --> 00:04:17,140
Meaning what?

111
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:18,141
Meaning that we'll just try

112
00:04:18,141 --> 00:04:20,143
living without any modern
conveniences

113
00:04:20,143 --> 00:04:22,145
and we'll see who yells "uncle"
first--

114
00:04:22,145 --> 00:04:23,146
the men or the women.

115
00:04:23,146 --> 00:04:24,147
Okay.
Okay.

116
00:04:24,147 --> 00:04:26,149
Okay, what do you want to bet?

117
00:04:26,149 --> 00:04:27,150
How about $10?

118
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:28,651
What's the matter with $20?

119
00:04:29,152 --> 00:04:30,653
Well, what's the matter with $30?

120
00:04:31,154 --> 00:04:32,655
What's the matter with $50?

121
00:04:32,655 --> 00:04:35,158
What was the matter with $10?

122
00:04:41,164 --> 00:04:42,165
Okay, 50 bucks!

123
00:04:42,165 --> 00:04:43,666
What are the rules?

124
00:04:44,167 --> 00:04:44,667
Well...

125
00:04:45,168 --> 00:04:45,668
I know.

126
00:04:46,169 --> 00:04:47,670
We'll pick a year, like 1900

127
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:48,671
and we won't use

128
00:04:48,671 --> 00:04:50,173
anything that was invented after
that.

129
00:04:50,173 --> 00:04:51,174
Good. 1900.

130
00:04:51,174 --> 00:04:53,176
Uh, did they use electric lights

131
00:04:53,176 --> 00:04:54,177
before then, Fred?

132
00:04:54,177 --> 00:04:56,679
Don't look at me-- ask Ethel.

133
00:04:58,181 --> 00:04:59,182
Now, listen, you old...

134
00:04:59,182 --> 00:05:00,683
Never mind, never mind.

135
00:05:00,683 --> 00:05:02,185
1900. That's a good date.

136
00:05:02,185 --> 00:05:04,187
Okay, tomorrow we all go back

137
00:05:04,187 --> 00:05:05,188
to the gay '90s.

138
00:05:05,188 --> 00:05:06,189
23 Skidoo!

139
00:05:06,189 --> 00:05:07,190
(all laugh)

140
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:12,111
Morning, Lucy.

141
00:05:12,111 --> 00:05:13,112
Hi, Ethel.

142
00:05:13,112 --> 00:05:14,113
What's all this?

143
00:05:14,113 --> 00:05:16,616
I've been shopping in a junk store.

144
00:05:16,616 --> 00:05:19,118
Say, those lamps are a good idea.

145
00:05:19,118 --> 00:05:21,120
I was going to use candles.

146
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,622
(giggles)

147
00:05:22,622 --> 00:05:23,623
How's Ricky?

148
00:05:23,623 --> 00:05:24,624
Has he run into any snags yet?

149
00:05:24,624 --> 00:05:25,625
Well, not really.

150
00:05:25,625 --> 00:05:27,126
He got very upset when he found out

151
00:05:27,627 --> 00:05:29,128
he couldn't use his electric razor.

152
00:05:29,128 --> 00:05:30,129
So did Fred.

153
00:05:30,129 --> 00:05:31,631
And what a fuss he made.

154
00:05:31,631 --> 00:05:33,132
I don't see anything so tough

155
00:05:33,132 --> 00:05:35,635
about shaving with a sharp-edged
razor

156
00:05:35,635 --> 00:05:36,636
and cold water, do you?

157
00:05:36,636 --> 00:05:38,137
No.

158
00:05:38,137 --> 00:05:39,138
(laughing)

159
00:05:39,138 --> 00:05:41,641
Fred just refused to shave at all.

160
00:05:41,641 --> 00:05:43,142
No kidding.

161
00:05:43,142 --> 00:05:44,143
What's that?

162
00:05:44,143 --> 00:05:46,145
Oh, look at this.

163
00:05:48,147 --> 00:05:49,148
A bathtub!

164
00:05:49,148 --> 00:05:50,650
Lucy, you're not going to make Ricky

165
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:51,651
take a bath in that?

166
00:05:52,151 --> 00:05:53,152
Why not?

167
00:05:53,152 --> 00:05:54,654
We want to win the bet, don't we?

168
00:05:54,654 --> 00:05:55,655
Yeah.

169
00:05:55,655 --> 00:05:56,656
RICKY: Lucy!

170
00:05:58,658 --> 00:05:59,659
Lucy!

171
00:05:59,659 --> 00:06:00,660
Yeah, yeah?

172
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:02,662
Lucy, I want...

173
00:06:02,662 --> 00:06:03,663
Oh. Good morning, Ethel.

174
00:06:03,663 --> 00:06:04,664
Hi.

175
00:06:04,664 --> 00:06:05,665
(chuckling)

176
00:06:05,665 --> 00:06:07,667
(mocks chuckling)

177
00:06:07,667 --> 00:06:10,169
Look at all this junk.

178
00:06:10,169 --> 00:06:12,171
Is breakfast ready?

179
00:06:12,672 --> 00:06:14,173
Well, I was just about to fix it,
dear.

180
00:06:14,173 --> 00:06:15,174
What'll you have?

181
00:06:15,174 --> 00:06:17,176
Coffee, toast, a transfusion?

182
00:06:17,176 --> 00:06:18,678
Never mind that.

183
00:06:18,678 --> 00:06:20,179
Is breakfast ready?

184
00:06:20,179 --> 00:06:22,181
I'll fix it for you right now.

185
00:06:22,181 --> 00:06:25,184
Hey, you can't use the electric
stove, you know.

186
00:06:25,184 --> 00:06:26,185
Oh, yes, I can.

187
00:06:41,701 --> 00:06:43,703
(whistles)

188
00:06:43,703 --> 00:06:45,204
Lucy!
Lucy, you...!

189
00:06:45,204 --> 00:06:46,706
You can't light that.

190
00:06:46,706 --> 00:06:49,208
This is the way my grandmother
cooked.

191
00:06:49,208 --> 00:06:51,210
This stove is not built that way.

192
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:52,712
It won't work.

193
00:06:52,712 --> 00:06:54,213
It'll set the house on fire.

194
00:06:54,213 --> 00:06:56,716
All right, do you want to eat cold
food?

195
00:06:56,716 --> 00:06:59,218
Well, I guess we'll have to
compromise.

196
00:06:59,218 --> 00:07:01,721
You can use the stove, but nothing
else.

197
00:07:01,721 --> 00:07:02,722
Thank you.

198
00:07:02,722 --> 00:07:05,224
Where's my coffee?

199
00:07:05,224 --> 00:07:07,226
Coming up, sire.

200
00:07:07,226 --> 00:07:10,229
(whistling)

201
00:07:49,769 --> 00:07:51,771
My grandmother was Swedish.

202
00:07:54,273 --> 00:07:54,774
Howdy, neighbors.

203
00:07:55,274 --> 00:07:55,775
Hi, Fred.

204
00:07:56,275 --> 00:07:57,276
Hello, Fred.

205
00:07:57,276 --> 00:07:58,778
I thought I'd find you up here,
Ethel.

206
00:07:58,778 --> 00:07:59,779
We are out of butter.

207
00:07:59,779 --> 00:08:00,780
Oh, dear.

208
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:02,281
I'll run down to the store for some.

209
00:08:02,281 --> 00:08:03,282
Ethel, if you're going out for butter

210
00:08:03,282 --> 00:08:04,784
will you get me a loaf of bread,
please?

211
00:08:04,784 --> 00:08:05,785
Sure.

212
00:08:05,785 --> 00:08:07,286
Now, just a minute, my pretty maid.

213
00:08:07,286 --> 00:08:09,789
My grandmother churned her own
butter.

214
00:08:09,789 --> 00:08:11,791
Yeah!

215
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:12,792
Churned?

216
00:08:12,792 --> 00:08:13,793
Yeah.

217
00:08:13,793 --> 00:08:14,794
That's right.

218
00:08:14,794 --> 00:08:17,296
And my grandmother baked her own
bread.

219
00:08:17,296 --> 00:08:20,299
Baked? Like I bake a cake?

220
00:08:20,299 --> 00:08:21,801
I hope not.

221
00:08:23,302 --> 00:08:24,804
Bake bread.

222
00:08:24,804 --> 00:08:25,805
Churn butter.

223
00:08:25,805 --> 00:08:27,306
Yeah.

224
00:08:27,306 --> 00:08:28,808
Well, you'd like to call off the bet?

225
00:08:28,808 --> 00:08:30,309
No!
No!

226
00:08:30,309 --> 00:08:32,311
You churn a little extra butter for
me

227
00:08:32,311 --> 00:08:34,814
and I'll bake a little extra bread
for you.

228
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:58,871
(knocking at door)

229
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:05,378
Hi, Ethel, how's the butter churner?

230
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:06,879
Oh, I've been churning

231
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:07,880
for two hours.

232
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,382
Well, you deserve a rest.

233
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:10,883
Put that thing down.

234
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:13,386
I can't!

235
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:14,887
Pry me loose, will ya?

236
00:09:14,887 --> 00:09:17,890
My hands are beginning to grow to
this thing.

237
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:18,891
Are you kidding?

238
00:09:18,891 --> 00:09:19,892
I can't get them off.

239
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:22,395
Well, maybe you can pull it right out
that way, huh?

240
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:23,896
Pull!
Well, relax now, relax.

241
00:09:23,896 --> 00:09:24,897
I can't! Pull!

242
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:28,401
(squeals in pain): Oh!

243
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:30,903
You poor kid!

244
00:09:31,904 --> 00:09:32,905
Oh, gosh!

245
00:09:32,905 --> 00:09:35,408
How much butter did you make?

246
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:36,909
None.

247
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:39,912
You've been churning for two hours

248
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:41,414
and you didn't make any butter?

249
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:42,915
Our grandmothers must have had arms

250
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:44,917
like Gorgeous George.

251
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:49,422
How long does it take milk to turn
into butter?

252
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:52,425
Ethel, you have to start with cream
to make butter.

253
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:53,926
Anybody knows that.

254
00:09:53,926 --> 00:09:54,927
My goodness!

255
00:09:54,927 --> 00:09:55,928
Oh, cream!

256
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:56,929
Certainly.

257
00:09:56,929 --> 00:09:58,431
Oh. How you coming with the bread?

258
00:09:58,431 --> 00:09:59,932
Well, it-it's very interesting.

259
00:09:59,932 --> 00:10:01,934
You see, you mix everything together

260
00:10:01,934 --> 00:10:03,936
you put the yeast in, you mix it all
up

261
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:04,937
and you knead it, knead it.

262
00:10:04,937 --> 00:10:06,939
This it what you call "kneading" it,
see?

263
00:10:06,939 --> 00:10:08,441
Yeah.

264
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:10,943
And then you let it set, and it
rises, see?

265
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:13,446
And then you take it out, and you
knead it again.

266
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:15,948
And you let it set, and it rises some
more.

267
00:10:15,948 --> 00:10:18,451
Then you put it in the oven, and you
bake it.

268
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:19,952
Well, that sounds simple.

269
00:10:19,952 --> 00:10:21,954
Sure. I had to go to three, four
stores

270
00:10:21,954 --> 00:10:24,457
before I could get enough yeast,
though.

271
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:25,958
Why? How much did you need?

272
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:28,461
13 cakes.

273
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:29,962
13 cakes?

274
00:10:29,962 --> 00:10:31,964
That seems like an awful lot.

275
00:10:31,964 --> 00:10:33,966
Well, here's the recipe right here.

276
00:10:33,966 --> 00:10:34,967
Let me see.

277
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:36,469
Lucy.

278
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:37,470
What?

279
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:38,971
Three cakes.

280
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:39,972
Oh, really?

281
00:10:39,972 --> 00:10:41,974
Oh, well, they're small.

282
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:44,477
It won't make much difference.

283
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:46,979
Well, now you have to put it in a
bowl.

284
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:48,481
Mm-hmm.

285
00:10:49,982 --> 00:10:50,983
There.

286
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:52,485
"Now set in warm place to rise."

287
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:53,986
Yeah, and I'm going to put it

288
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:55,488
right down here by the oven.

289
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:56,489
Okay.

290
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:59,992
Oh! Now, let's get back to the butter
department.

291
00:10:59,992 --> 00:11:01,994
All right.

292
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,002
Gosh!

293
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:15,007
Ethel, help me.

294
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:17,510
Oh.

295
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:19,011
Can you lift it?

296
00:11:19,011 --> 00:11:20,012
(groans)

297
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:22,515
Gee, I must have hurt this some way.

298
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:23,516
What do you mean?

299
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:25,017
It's all swollen.

300
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:27,019
I told you that was too much yeast.

301
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:30,022
Well, I just won't have to bake again
so soon.

302
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:31,524
Now I have to knead it again.

303
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:33,025
Yeah.

304
00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:35,027
And then I have to let it set again.

305
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:36,028
Yeah.

306
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:38,531
There now.

307
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:41,033
Oh. You want to get me a bigger bowl?

308
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:42,034
Here?

309
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:44,036
Yeah.

310
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:47,039
How's this, Lucy?

311
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:50,042
Okay... ooh!

312
00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:53,546
You think that's enough?

313
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:54,547
Yeah.

314
00:11:56,048 --> 00:11:57,049
Oh!

315
00:11:57,049 --> 00:12:00,052
Sorry, honey, I'm sorry.

316
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:01,554
There.

317
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:05,558
Now I let that set and that rises.

318
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:06,559
You better help me.

319
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:08,060
Yeah, I thought so.

320
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:11,063
(both groan)

321
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:16,068
There. Back to the butter.

322
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:24,577
See, I told you that cream would do
the trick.

323
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:26,579
Imagine-- all that butter

324
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:29,081
and it only cost me $23.75.

325
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:32,084
(both scream)

326
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:33,586
Ethel!

327
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:34,587
Oh, Lucy!

328
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:36,589
Oh, oh, my...

329
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:37,590
Ethel!
I've got it.

330
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:39,592
That's awful heavy.

331
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:40,593
Let me help.

332
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:42,595
Oh! Oh, oh!

333
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:43,596
Oh!
Oh...

334
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:44,597
Get this out of here.

335
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:45,598
You want some help?

336
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:46,599
Ow! Look, wait a minute.

337
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:47,600
Let me turn the bowl.

338
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,601
Oh!

339
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:51,103
(grunts)

340
00:12:51,103 --> 00:12:52,605
I think this has grown to the bowl.

341
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:55,107
Here, put the bowl over there.

342
00:12:55,107 --> 00:12:57,610
My goodness!

343
00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:02,114
Well, it's a happy, little loaf,
isn't it?

344
00:13:02,114 --> 00:13:04,116
I have to knead this.

345
00:13:04,116 --> 00:13:05,618
All right.

346
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:07,119
I'll hold the board.

347
00:13:11,123 --> 00:13:12,124
Whoa!

348
00:13:12,124 --> 00:13:13,125
Oh!

349
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:15,127
Ethel! Ethel!

350
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:25,638
(grunts)

351
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:26,639
Whoa! Hang on now!

352
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:31,644
Oh, Ethel, help me put it on the
board!

353
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:34,647
Put it up on the board!

354
00:13:36,148 --> 00:13:38,651
I'm sorry, Ethel.

355
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:41,654
Get that pan over there.

356
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:42,655
A pan?

357
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:43,656
Yeah.

358
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:44,657
How's this?

359
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:46,158
All right.

360
00:13:46,158 --> 00:13:47,159
Oh, wait a minute

361
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:49,161
there's a yeast bit there.

362
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:50,162
I got it, I got it.

363
00:13:50,162 --> 00:13:51,664
Where?

364
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:53,165
There it is, over there.

365
00:13:53,165 --> 00:13:54,667
All right, ready?

366
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:55,668
Ready.

367
00:14:00,172 --> 00:14:02,174
Whoo!

368
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:05,678
Now I have to...

369
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:08,180
I have to shape it into a loaf.

370
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:09,181
Yeah?

371
00:14:12,184 --> 00:14:13,185
Open the oven.

372
00:14:13,185 --> 00:14:14,687
Oh, open the oven.

373
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:18,691
There.

374
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:19,692
You ready?

375
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:21,193
Come on, now, yeah.

376
00:14:23,195 --> 00:14:24,196
Look out.

377
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:27,700
Oh!
Oh!

378
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:31,704
(both groan)

379
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:32,705
There.

380
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:34,206
Now, let's see.

381
00:14:34,206 --> 00:14:35,708
The oven's all preheated

382
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:36,709
like it says

383
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:38,210
and in a couple of hours

384
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:40,713
we'll have some nice homemade bread.

385
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:41,714
And butter.

386
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:42,715
Yeah. What's so tough

387
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:44,717
about this pioneering business?

388
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:45,718
Let's play canasta.

389
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:47,720
Okay.

390
00:14:49,221 --> 00:14:50,723
(doorbell buzzes)

391
00:14:51,223 --> 00:14:53,225
Don't you look at my hand, now.

392
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:58,230
Oh, telegram.

393
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:02,234
Thank you.

394
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:09,241
Oh, Ethel, it's from the Society
Matrons League!

395
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:10,242
We're in, we're in!

396
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:11,243
No kidding.

397
00:15:11,243 --> 00:15:12,244
Look at this!

398
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:13,245
Let me see, let me see.

399
00:15:13,245 --> 00:15:14,747
"You are invited to a tea

400
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:16,749
"Friday afternoon at the Waldorf

401
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:17,750
to be scrutinized..."

402
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:19,251
Scrutinized?

403
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:20,252
That's what it says.

404
00:15:20,252 --> 00:15:21,754
"Before your final acceptance

405
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:23,756
into the Society Matrons League."
Yippee!

406
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:25,758
Oh, isn't that wonderful?!
Oh, yes.

407
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:27,760
Now, we have to look real sharp on
Friday.

408
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:28,761
We have to go to the beauty parlor

409
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:30,262
and we have to get the works:

410
00:15:30,262 --> 00:15:32,264
a-a shampoo, a fingerwave, a
manicure, a pedicure

411
00:15:32,264 --> 00:15:33,265
a permanent...

412
00:15:33,265 --> 00:15:34,266
Oh, wait a minute, Lucy.

413
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:35,267
What?

414
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:37,269
If we go to a modern beauty parlor

415
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:38,771
we'll lose that bet with the boys.

416
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:39,772
Oh, gosh.

417
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:41,273
Oh, it looks like it'll cost us

418
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:43,275
50 bucks apiece to be Society
Matrons.

419
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:45,778
Now, wait a minute, wait a minute.

420
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:47,279
There must be some way.

421
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:48,781
I know, Ethel, our clothes.

422
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:49,782
What do you mean?

423
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:51,784
Well, if we... if we were really
living in 1900

424
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:53,285
we'd be wearing bustles and corsets

425
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:54,787
and the fellows would be wearing

426
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:56,288
high-button shoes and celluloid
collars

427
00:15:56,288 --> 00:15:58,290
and those skimpy suits all the time.

428
00:15:58,290 --> 00:15:59,792
You mean, on the street and down to
work?

429
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:00,793
All the time

430
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:02,294
and you know they'd never agree to
that

431
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:03,295
and we'd win the bet.

432
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:04,296
You're right.

433
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:06,298
Hey, do you smell bread?

434
00:16:06,298 --> 00:16:07,800
Maybe it's done.

435
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:14,306
How did the oven door get open?

436
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:16,809
(screams)

437
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:19,311
Ethel! Ethel, help!

438
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:20,813
Oh, Ethel!

439
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:21,814
Oh, Ethel!

440
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:23,816
Ethel, I'm stuck!

441
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:25,818
Ethel, get me out!

442
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:27,319
Oh, Ethel!

443
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:29,822
Hurry up!
Hurry up!

444
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:31,824
Oh! Watch out for my leg!

445
00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:33,826
Watch out for my leg!

446
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:36,829
Ethel, watch out, it'll drop in my
lap!

447
00:16:44,286 --> 00:16:45,287
Hi, Ethel.

448
00:16:45,287 --> 00:16:46,789
How do I look?

449
00:16:46,789 --> 00:16:49,291
Oh, you look wonderful!

450
00:16:49,291 --> 00:16:50,793
How do I look?

451
00:16:50,793 --> 00:16:51,794
Like a doll

452
00:16:51,794 --> 00:16:52,795
like an old-fashioned doll.

453
00:16:52,795 --> 00:16:53,796
(both giggling)

454
00:16:53,796 --> 00:16:55,297
Fred's in the bathtub.

455
00:16:55,297 --> 00:16:56,799
I hid all of his clothes

456
00:16:56,799 --> 00:16:58,801
and left the old-fashioned ones.

457
00:16:59,301 --> 00:17:00,302
Oh, good girl.

458
00:17:00,302 --> 00:17:01,804
That's what I'm going to do to Ricky.

459
00:17:02,304 --> 00:17:03,305
Gee, I hope this works, Lucy.

460
00:17:03,806 --> 00:17:05,808
It will, but if it doesn't, I just
had another thought.

461
00:17:06,308 --> 00:17:07,309
What?

462
00:17:07,309 --> 00:17:08,310
Well, you know

463
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:09,812
I never mentioned transportation to
Ricky

464
00:17:09,812 --> 00:17:11,814
so I'm going to watch out the window
tonight

465
00:17:11,814 --> 00:17:12,815
and if he comes home

466
00:17:12,815 --> 00:17:13,816
in a cab, a bus or a subway

467
00:17:13,816 --> 00:17:14,817
we win the bet.

468
00:17:14,817 --> 00:17:15,818
Ah, that's wonderful.

469
00:17:15,818 --> 00:17:16,819
We're in.

470
00:17:16,819 --> 00:17:18,320
I'll see you later.

471
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:19,321
Okay.

472
00:17:20,322 --> 00:17:21,824
Oh, no!

473
00:17:27,830 --> 00:17:33,085
Ridi pagliaccio

474
00:17:33,585 --> 00:17:37,589
(humming "Vesti la Giubba" from I
Pagliacci)

475
00:17:37,589 --> 00:17:39,591
(Ricky laughing)

476
00:17:39,591 --> 00:17:42,594
Oh, don't be so happy.

477
00:17:42,594 --> 00:17:47,099
Ah, honey, I love living in the turn
of the century.

478
00:17:47,099 --> 00:17:49,101
I love a hot bath, too.

479
00:17:49,101 --> 00:17:51,103
Here are your clothes.

480
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:52,604
What, my clothes!?

481
00:17:52,604 --> 00:17:55,107
Those old-fashioned- looking things?

482
00:17:55,107 --> 00:17:57,109
Yeah. You thought it was fine that I
was wearing them.

483
00:17:57,109 --> 00:17:59,611
Now wait a minute, honey, it's
different with you.

484
00:17:59,611 --> 00:18:01,613
You stay in the house all day.

485
00:18:01,613 --> 00:18:04,116
I got to go out on the street and be
seen by people.

486
00:18:04,116 --> 00:18:05,117
Sorry!

487
00:18:05,117 --> 00:18:06,618
Now Lucy, you can't be serious

488
00:18:06,618 --> 00:18:08,620
about me wearing these clothes.

489
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:09,621
I got to go out on the street.

490
00:18:09,621 --> 00:18:11,123
I got to...

491
00:18:11,123 --> 00:18:15,127
Oh, no, no, no, no, no!
Lucy, look out, look out!

492
00:18:15,127 --> 00:18:19,131
(yelling in Spanish)

493
00:18:20,632 --> 00:18:22,684
(doorbell buzzing)

494
00:18:29,691 --> 00:18:30,692
Hi, kiddo.

495
00:18:32,694 --> 00:18:35,197
I am the chicken inspector.

496
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:41,203
And it's my day to crow.

497
00:18:41,203 --> 00:18:43,205
With a little razzmatazz.

498
00:18:43,205 --> 00:18:44,706
What's with him?

499
00:18:44,706 --> 00:18:47,209
He likes those clothes.

500
00:18:47,209 --> 00:18:49,294
What do I care what kind of clothes I
wear

501
00:18:49,294 --> 00:18:50,796
just to fix the plumbing?

502
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:53,298
Besides, these remind me of the days

503
00:18:53,298 --> 00:18:55,300
when I was a gay, young blade.

504
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:56,802
(wolf whistle)

505
00:18:56,802 --> 00:19:00,806
While strolling through the park one
day

506
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:04,810
In the merry, merry month of may

507
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:08,814
I was taken by surprise

508
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:14,319
By a pair of roguish eyes

509
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:17,322
While strolling through the park one
day

510
00:19:17,322 --> 00:19:18,824
In may.

511
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:19,825
Very good, old man.

512
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:20,826
Thank you, sir.

513
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:23,328
(men laughing)

514
00:19:23,328 --> 00:19:25,831
You know, Lucy, you gave me a great
idea.

515
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:27,833
I'm going to put a gay '90s number

516
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:29,334
down at the club.

517
00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:30,836
Now just a minute, Ricky.

518
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:32,838
You know you have to wear those
clothes all the time

519
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:33,839
not just down at the club.

520
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:34,840
I know, honey.

521
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,341
Be a wonderful advertisement

522
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:37,342
for the show!

523
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:38,844
Oh!
Oh, fine.

524
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:40,846
FRED: Hey, Rick, doesn't Ethel look
cute?

525
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:43,348
But what are you wearing that bustle
for, honey?

526
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:45,851
You don't need it.

527
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:47,853
Pay no attention to him.

528
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:49,354
You leave it on.

529
00:19:49,354 --> 00:19:51,356
I'm not wearing a bustle.

530
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:55,861
Eww!

531
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:57,863
(doorbell buzzes)

532
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:02,868
Uh, is this the Ricardo residence?

533
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:04,870
Yes, I'm Mrs. Ricardo.

534
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:07,873
Good. I'm Mrs. Pettibone.
This is Mrs. Pomerance.

535
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:10,876
We're the surprise investigating
committee

536
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:12,878
for the Society Matrons League.

537
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:15,380
Oh... oh!

538
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:16,882
Uh, oh, won't you come in, please?

539
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:18,383
Oh!

540
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:20,886
Uh, oh, this is Mr. and Mrs...

541
00:20:21,386 --> 00:20:22,888
I mean, Mr. and Mrs. Mertz.

542
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:23,889
FRED: Hiya!

543
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:26,391
Uh, and this is my husband, Mr. uh...
uh...

544
00:20:26,391 --> 00:20:27,392
(snapping fingers)

545
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:28,894
Ricardo... Ricardo.

546
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:29,895
Mr. Ricardo.

547
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:31,396
Won't you sit down, please?

548
00:20:37,402 --> 00:20:38,403
Um...

549
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:40,906
we pop in like this unexpectedly

550
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:42,407
so as to investigate

551
00:20:42,407 --> 00:20:45,410
how our prospective members really
live.

552
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:46,912
Oh.

553
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:49,915
We want to make sure they're not
bringing

554
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:52,417
their best foot forward just for us.

555
00:20:52,417 --> 00:20:54,920
Uh, do you dress like this normally?

556
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:55,921
Well, I...

557
00:20:55,921 --> 00:20:59,424
Oh, it's not an every, uh...

558
00:20:59,424 --> 00:21:00,425
Not as a...

559
00:21:00,425 --> 00:21:01,927
Er, uh...

560
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:02,928
Oh, I see.

561
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:06,431
Uh, do you mind if we look around?

562
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:08,433
Uh, no, of course not.

563
00:21:08,433 --> 00:21:09,935
Help yourselves.

564
00:21:09,935 --> 00:21:11,937
Uh, where's the kitchen, please?

565
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:14,439
The kitchen?

566
00:21:14,439 --> 00:21:16,441
Thank you.

567
00:21:20,445 --> 00:21:21,947
What are we going to do?

568
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:22,948
I don't know, what can we do?

569
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:25,450
Ricky, Ricky, you can think of
something, can't you?

570
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:26,451
RICKY: Sure.

571
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:27,452
What?

572
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:29,955
You want to call off the bet?

573
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:31,456
No.
No!

574
00:21:31,456 --> 00:21:32,958
All right, honey, all right.

575
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:34,960
I know how much this means to you.

576
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:35,961
I got an idea.

577
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:36,962
What?

578
00:21:36,962 --> 00:21:38,463
I'll tell them that we're putting on

579
00:21:38,463 --> 00:21:39,464
an act together for our club

580
00:21:39,464 --> 00:21:41,466
and they caught us right in the
middle of rehearsal.

581
00:21:41,466 --> 00:21:42,968
Oh, honey, That's wonderful.

582
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:44,469
Thank you.

583
00:21:44,469 --> 00:21:47,472
Quite interesting.

584
00:21:47,472 --> 00:21:49,975
Quaint, to say the least.

585
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:53,478
Eh, ladies, eh, I know what you must
think.

586
00:21:53,478 --> 00:21:55,480
You do?

587
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:57,983
Uh, yes, you see, you chose the wrong
time

588
00:21:57,983 --> 00:21:59,484
for your investigation.

589
00:21:59,484 --> 00:22:02,988
I mean, that is to see the way that
we really live.

590
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:05,991
You see, eh, we're putting an act
together for my club

591
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:09,494
and you caught us right in the middle
of rehearsal.

592
00:22:09,494 --> 00:22:10,996
You put on shows?

593
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:11,997
Yes.

594
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:12,998
Why?

595
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,001
Why not?

596
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:19,004
I mean, uh, do you do this for a
living?

597
00:22:19,004 --> 00:22:20,005
Oh, no, no.

598
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:21,006
(chuckles)

599
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:23,008
We just developed a bad habit.

600
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:24,509
We like to eat.

601
00:22:26,511 --> 00:22:28,013
Show people.

602
00:22:28,013 --> 00:22:31,016
Uh, Matilda, we've been allowing show
people

603
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:33,018
to join for several seasons now.

604
00:22:33,018 --> 00:22:35,520
Oh, yes, it happened three years ago

605
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,022
when we needed money.

606
00:22:37,022 --> 00:22:40,025
Um, well, we're willing to make
allowances.

607
00:22:40,025 --> 00:22:41,026
We'll look you over

608
00:22:41,026 --> 00:22:43,028
at the Friday afternoon tea, ladies.

609
00:22:43,028 --> 00:22:44,529
Good afternoon, gentlemen.

610
00:22:44,529 --> 00:22:46,031
Uh, just a minute, just a minute,
just a minute.

611
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:48,033
What do you mean, "make allowances"?

612
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:50,035
What's wrong with show people?

613
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:51,536
Well, you must admit

614
00:22:51,536 --> 00:22:54,039
that most of them are a little,
uh-uh...

615
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:55,540
My dear Mrs. Ricardo

616
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:58,043
please don't misunderstand me.

617
00:22:58,043 --> 00:23:00,545
The Society Matrons League as a body

618
00:23:00,545 --> 00:23:03,548
does not disapprove of show people as
such.

619
00:23:03,548 --> 00:23:04,549
Mm-hmm, well, perhaps

620
00:23:04,549 --> 00:23:06,551
we have something against the League.

621
00:23:06,551 --> 00:23:09,554
When you get back to your
blue-blooded sisters

622
00:23:09,554 --> 00:23:11,556
tell them that the Ricardo/Mertz

623
00:23:11,556 --> 00:23:14,059
investigating committee looked you
over

624
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:15,560
and we have no desire to join

625
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:17,062
your phony baloney club!

626
00:23:17,062 --> 00:23:19,064
RICKY: Yeah, tell them that.

627
00:23:19,064 --> 00:23:20,565
Go ahead, tell them that.

628
00:23:20,565 --> 00:23:22,067
Well!

629
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:23,568
Well, I guess we'd better leave!

630
00:23:23,568 --> 00:23:25,070
Good afternoon.

631
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:26,571
So long, kids.

632
00:23:31,576 --> 00:23:33,578
Oh, Lucy, you were wonderful!

633
00:23:33,578 --> 00:23:35,580
Ha, ha, baby, I love you!

634
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:37,082
You told those bats.

635
00:23:37,082 --> 00:23:38,583
Yeah.

636
00:23:38,583 --> 00:23:40,585
Oh, Lucy, you said all the things

637
00:23:40,585 --> 00:23:43,088
I was trying to think of and
couldn't.

638
00:23:43,088 --> 00:23:45,090
Ah, sweetheart, I'm so proud of you.

639
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:48,093
I'm going to give you the $50 and
call off the bet.

640
00:23:48,593 --> 00:23:50,095
Oh, Ricky, that's wonderful!

641
00:23:50,095 --> 00:23:51,596
Listen, honey, I'm starved.

642
00:23:51,596 --> 00:23:53,098
Let's go out to dinner, eh?

643
00:23:53,098 --> 00:23:54,599
Good.

644
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:55,600
We got plenty of food right here.

645
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:56,601
Well, where?
Wha...?

646
00:23:56,601 --> 00:23:58,103
Right here.

647
00:23:59,104 --> 00:24:01,606
Homemade bread with home-churned
butter.

648
00:24:01,606 --> 00:24:02,607
(all laughing)

649
00:24:02,607 --> 00:24:04,109
Dive in, everybody.

650
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:06,111
The last one in the middle

651
00:24:06,111 --> 00:24:07,612
is a rotten egg!

652
00:24:19,007 --> 00:24:22,010

Captioned by Media Access Group at
WGBH access.wgbh.org

00:24:33,522 --> 00:24:36,024
Mrs. Pettibone was played by Florence
Bates.

655
00:24:36,525 --> 00:24:39,027
Mrs. Pomerance was played by Ruth
Parent.

656
00:25:13,061 --> 00:25:15,564
I love Lucy is a Desilu production.

00:00:33,666 --> 00:00:37,170
(whistling)

4
00:00:38,171 --> 00:00:40,173
Hi, Lucy. I'm going down to the
store.

5
00:00:40,173 --> 00:00:41,674
Do you want...
What are you doing?

6
00:00:41,674 --> 00:00:43,176
Cleaning out the desk.

7
00:00:43,176 --> 00:00:45,678
Hasn't been done in a year.
Boy, what a mess.

8
00:00:45,678 --> 00:00:48,681
They sure fill up with junk, don't
they?
I'll say.

9
00:00:48,681 --> 00:00:50,683
Is this the stuff you're throwing
away?

10
00:00:50,683 --> 00:00:52,685
No, that's the stuff I'm keeping.

11
00:00:52,685 --> 00:00:54,687
What I'm throwing away is in the
wastebasket.

12
00:01:00,193 --> 00:01:03,696
You're sure getting rid of a lot.

13
00:01:03,696 --> 00:01:07,200
Now, here's something no home should
be without.

14
00:01:12,205 --> 00:01:13,206
What is it?

15
00:01:13,706 --> 00:01:14,707
I don't know.

16
00:01:14,707 --> 00:01:16,209
Why don't you throw it away?

17
00:01:16,209 --> 00:01:18,711
Well, I can't till I find out what it
is.

18
00:01:18,711 --> 00:01:20,713
Might be something I need.

19
00:01:20,713 --> 00:01:22,715
I give up.

20
00:01:22,715 --> 00:01:24,717
Don't you ever throw anything away?

21
00:01:24,717 --> 00:01:26,219
Not very often, no.

22
00:01:26,219 --> 00:01:29,222
Everything brings back some sort of a
memory.

23
00:01:29,222 --> 00:01:30,223
For instance, these are mementos

24
00:01:30,223 --> 00:01:31,724
from all our wedding anniversaries.

25
00:01:31,724 --> 00:01:33,226
I keep something from each one.

26
00:01:33,226 --> 00:01:35,728
Oh, Lucy, you're an incurable
sentimentalist.

27
00:01:35,728 --> 00:01:39,232
Yeah, I'm sticky over Ricky.

28
00:01:39,232 --> 00:01:40,733
Here's our marriage license.

29
00:01:40,733 --> 00:01:42,235
Aw.

30
00:01:42,235 --> 00:01:44,237
This is the little piece of paper

31
00:01:44,237 --> 00:01:46,239
that changed my name to "Ricardo."

32
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:50,243
"On this day, Lucille Esmeralda
MacGillicuddy

33
00:01:50,243 --> 00:01:52,245
"was married to Ricky...

34
00:01:52,245 --> 00:01:53,746
Bicardi"?

35
00:01:53,746 --> 00:01:55,748
Bicardi?

36
00:01:55,748 --> 00:01:58,751
Yeah, B-I-C-A-R-D-I.

37
00:01:58,751 --> 00:02:00,253
I never noticed that before--

38
00:02:00,253 --> 00:02:01,754
must be a mistake in typing.

39
00:02:02,255 --> 00:02:04,257
Well, it doesn't make any difference.

40
00:02:04,257 --> 00:02:05,258
Well, I don't know.

41
00:02:05,258 --> 00:02:07,260
You know how funny the laws are.

42
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:08,261
Gee.

43
00:02:08,261 --> 00:02:09,762
Ethel, you don't suppose

44
00:02:09,762 --> 00:02:11,764
this license isn't legal, do you?

45
00:02:11,764 --> 00:02:13,266
Oh, of course it's legal.

46
00:02:13,266 --> 00:02:15,268
Don't be ridiculous, Lucy.

47
00:02:15,268 --> 00:02:18,771
Hey, I never saw this picture of you
two in a canoe before.

48
00:02:18,771 --> 00:02:20,273
When was it taken?

49
00:02:20,273 --> 00:02:23,776
Last summer, when Mr. Bicardi and I
were at the lake.

50
00:02:25,278 --> 00:02:26,779
Now, Lucy, you're not going

51
00:02:26,779 --> 00:02:28,781
to worry about that, are you?

52
00:02:28,781 --> 00:02:30,283
No.

53
00:02:30,283 --> 00:02:32,285
You are, too, aren't you?

54
00:02:32,285 --> 00:02:33,286
Yes.

55
00:02:33,286 --> 00:02:35,788
Well, it's just a simple clerical
error.

56
00:02:35,788 --> 00:02:37,790
Well, what if it matters?

57
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:38,791
Maybe for ten years

58
00:02:38,791 --> 00:02:41,794
Ricky and I would have been null and
void.

59
00:02:41,794 --> 00:02:43,796
Hi, honey, hi, Ethel.

60
00:02:43,796 --> 00:02:44,797
Hi.

61
00:02:44,797 --> 00:02:46,299
How's my little wife?

62
00:02:46,299 --> 00:02:48,801
(wailing)

63
00:02:48,801 --> 00:02:50,803
What's the matter with her?

64
00:02:51,304 --> 00:02:52,805
She's off on another one.

65
00:02:52,805 --> 00:02:55,308
Well, good luck, Mr. Bicardi.

66
00:02:56,809 --> 00:02:58,311
What?

67
00:02:59,312 --> 00:03:00,813
What's she talking about?

68
00:03:00,813 --> 00:03:02,315
What happened, honey?

69
00:03:02,315 --> 00:03:03,816
I was cleaning out the desk

70
00:03:03,816 --> 00:03:04,817
and I found this.

71
00:03:04,817 --> 00:03:06,819
That's our marriage license.

72
00:03:06,819 --> 00:03:07,820
Yeah.

73
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:09,322
Well, what's the matter?

74
00:03:09,822 --> 00:03:11,324
Don't tell me it's expired.

75
00:03:16,829 --> 00:03:18,331
Read it.

76
00:03:18,331 --> 00:03:21,334
"On this day, Lucille Esmeralda
MacGillicuddy

77
00:03:21,334 --> 00:03:23,336
was married to Ricky Ricardo."

78
00:03:23,336 --> 00:03:24,337
To Ricky who?

79
00:03:24,337 --> 00:03:25,838
"Ricky Ric...

80
00:03:25,838 --> 00:03:27,340
Bicardi"?

81
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:29,842
Oh, that's what she was talking
about.

82
00:03:29,842 --> 00:03:31,844
Well, honey, it's just a mistake.

83
00:03:31,844 --> 00:03:33,346
I'll say it is!

84
00:03:33,346 --> 00:03:35,348
We've never been married.

85
00:03:35,348 --> 00:03:37,350
Never been married?

86
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:38,351
No.

87
00:03:38,351 --> 00:03:39,352
Oh, now, sweetheart

88
00:03:39,352 --> 00:03:41,854
you're making a big thing out of
nothing.

89
00:03:41,854 --> 00:03:42,855
Nothing?

90
00:03:42,855 --> 00:03:45,358
Suppose there is a Ricky Bicardi.

91
00:03:45,358 --> 00:03:46,359
For all I know

92
00:03:46,359 --> 00:03:48,861
I might be married to a rum factory.

93
00:03:50,363 --> 00:03:52,865
Now, honey, you're being completely
ridiculous about this.

94
00:03:52,865 --> 00:03:54,367
Well, I want you to call your lawyer

95
00:03:54,367 --> 00:03:56,369
and ask him if we're legally married.

96
00:03:56,369 --> 00:03:57,870
Well, honey, my lawyer is out of town

97
00:03:57,870 --> 00:03:59,372
and besides, I'd feel silly...

98
00:03:59,372 --> 00:04:01,374
I'm going to call the City Hall.

99
00:04:01,374 --> 00:04:04,377
I'm going to get ahold of the License
Bureau

100
00:04:04,377 --> 00:04:06,879
and I'm going to find out.

101
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:09,382
Give me the City Hall, please.

102
00:04:09,382 --> 00:04:12,885
Well, this is an emergency.

103
00:04:12,885 --> 00:04:14,887
Thank you.

104
00:04:14,887 --> 00:04:15,888
Hello, City Hall?

105
00:04:15,888 --> 00:04:17,890
There's a mistake on my license

106
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:20,893
and I want to talk to someone about
it.

107
00:04:20,893 --> 00:04:24,397
What do you mean, "Call the tail
waggers"?

108
00:04:24,397 --> 00:04:28,401
It's... it's not a dog license, it's
a marriage license.

109
00:04:28,401 --> 00:04:29,402
Oh.

110
00:04:29,402 --> 00:04:30,903
Hello, Marriage Bureau?

111
00:04:30,903 --> 00:04:32,905
There's a mistake on my license

112
00:04:32,905 --> 00:04:35,908
and I want to know if it makes any
difference.

113
00:04:35,908 --> 00:04:38,411
Oh. All right, I'll be right down.

114
00:04:38,411 --> 00:04:39,912
They say they have to see it.

115
00:04:39,912 --> 00:04:41,414
Oh, honey, you're not going to go

116
00:04:41,414 --> 00:04:43,916
all the way down to the City Hall,
are you?

117
00:04:43,916 --> 00:04:45,918
Now, honey, I just can't rest

118
00:04:45,918 --> 00:04:46,919
until I find out.

119
00:04:46,919 --> 00:04:48,921
I'll be back as soon as I can.

120
00:04:50,423 --> 00:04:52,925
Ay, esta mujer esta completamente
loca.

121
00:04:52,925 --> 00:04:55,428
Casada por diez anos y todos los anos

122
00:04:55,428 --> 00:04:58,931
se pone peor y peor y peor de la
cabeza, esa muchacha.

123
00:05:00,066 --> 00:05:01,601
FRED: Hi, Rick.

124
00:05:03,102 --> 00:05:04,103
Oh, hi, Fred.

125
00:05:04,103 --> 00:05:05,605
Oh, sorry, I didn't know

126
00:05:05,605 --> 00:05:06,606
you were having a nap.

127
00:05:07,106 --> 00:05:08,107
That's all right.

128
00:05:08,107 --> 00:05:09,609
I got to get dressed anyway.

129
00:05:09,609 --> 00:05:11,110
Ethel just told me

130
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:13,613
about the mistake in your marriage
license.

131
00:05:13,613 --> 00:05:15,114
Isn't that silly?

132
00:05:15,114 --> 00:05:16,616
Yeah, I just got ours out

133
00:05:16,616 --> 00:05:17,617
and took a look at it.

134
00:05:17,617 --> 00:05:21,621
Some darn fool spelled my name right.

135
00:05:21,621 --> 00:05:24,624
Well, it wouldn't make any difference
anyway, Fred.

136
00:05:24,624 --> 00:05:28,127
I know. I thought I could worm out on
a technicality.

137
00:05:28,127 --> 00:05:29,629
Lucy was so worried

138
00:05:29,629 --> 00:05:32,632
that she went all the way down to the
License Bureau

139
00:05:32,632 --> 00:05:34,133
to find out how we stand.

140
00:05:34,133 --> 00:05:35,134
I wish I'd have known that.

141
00:05:35,134 --> 00:05:36,135
I got a good friend down there.

142
00:05:36,135 --> 00:05:37,136
I'd have called him for her.

143
00:05:37,136 --> 00:05:40,139
They won't tell her on the phone
anyway.

144
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:41,140
Oh.

145
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:43,643
I wonder what'd happen if this guy
tells her

146
00:05:43,643 --> 00:05:45,144
that the license is no good.

147
00:05:45,144 --> 00:05:46,145
(chuckling): Oh, no.

148
00:05:46,145 --> 00:05:50,149
Hey, how well do you know this guy?

149
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:52,652
Well, he's a pretty good friend of
mine. Why?

150
00:05:52,652 --> 00:05:53,653
He is, eh?

151
00:05:53,653 --> 00:05:54,654
Yeah.

152
00:05:54,654 --> 00:05:58,157
(chuckling)

153
00:05:58,157 --> 00:05:59,592
I was just thinking

154
00:05:59,592 --> 00:06:01,594
suppose you call this guy down there

155
00:06:01,594 --> 00:06:04,097
just for a gag, you know, and tell
him

156
00:06:04,097 --> 00:06:05,598
that when Lucy gets down there

157
00:06:05,598 --> 00:06:08,101
to tell her that the license is no
good

158
00:06:08,101 --> 00:06:10,103
and that we're not married at all.

159
00:06:10,103 --> 00:06:11,104
Do you think he'll do it?

160
00:06:11,104 --> 00:06:12,605
Oh, I know he'll do it.

161
00:06:28,087 --> 00:06:29,589
Any word from Lucy yet?

162
00:06:29,589 --> 00:06:30,590
RICKY: No.

163
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:31,591
It's 9:00.

164
00:06:31,591 --> 00:06:33,593
The License Bureau closed at 5:30.

165
00:06:33,593 --> 00:06:35,094
Where can she possibly be?

166
00:06:35,094 --> 00:06:36,095
I don't know.

167
00:06:36,095 --> 00:06:37,597
Oh, it's all my fault.

168
00:06:37,597 --> 00:06:40,099
RICKY: Oh, there she is now.

169
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:43,102
Honey, I've been so worried about
you...

170
00:06:43,102 --> 00:06:44,103
Don't.

171
00:06:44,103 --> 00:06:45,104
What's the matter?

172
00:06:45,104 --> 00:06:48,107
I'm no longer yours to touch.

173
00:06:49,108 --> 00:06:51,110
Well, now, Lucy, now, look, hon...

174
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:53,613
Did you see the man at the License
Bureau?

175
00:06:53,613 --> 00:06:54,614
Yes.

176
00:06:54,614 --> 00:06:56,616
We've been revoked.

177
00:06:58,117 --> 00:06:59,619
No!

178
00:06:59,619 --> 00:07:01,621
I didn't know what to do

179
00:07:01,621 --> 00:07:03,122
so I've just been walking.

180
00:07:03,122 --> 00:07:05,625
RICKY: You've been walking all this
time?

181
00:07:05,625 --> 00:07:06,626
Well, the last hour

182
00:07:06,626 --> 00:07:08,628
I was on a train coming home.

183
00:07:08,628 --> 00:07:10,630
On a train?

184
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:12,131
Where did you walk to?

185
00:07:12,131 --> 00:07:14,133
East Orange, New Jersey.

186
00:07:14,133 --> 00:07:18,638
How I ever got through the Holland
Tunnel, I don't know.

187
00:07:18,638 --> 00:07:21,641
Hey, you really took that news
seriously.

188
00:07:21,641 --> 00:07:23,142
Well, how do you think you'd feel

189
00:07:23,142 --> 00:07:25,144
if you suddenly found out you weren't
married to Ethel?

190
00:07:27,647 --> 00:07:28,648
Yeah!

191
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:31,651
Now, look, honey, look, sweetie

192
00:07:31,651 --> 00:07:33,152
I got something to tell you, honey.

193
00:07:33,152 --> 00:07:34,654
Oh, I know what you're going to say,
dear.

194
00:07:34,654 --> 00:07:36,656
No, honey, you don't, and this is
very important

195
00:07:36,656 --> 00:07:37,657
so don't stop me.
Now, look...

196
00:07:38,157 --> 00:07:40,159
I know what you're going to say,
baby--

197
00:07:40,159 --> 00:07:41,661
that you still love me

198
00:07:41,661 --> 00:07:43,663
and that it doesn't make any
difference to you

199
00:07:43,663 --> 00:07:45,164
whether we're legally married or not.

200
00:07:45,164 --> 00:07:47,166
Oh, Ricky, it's so wonderful of you.

201
00:07:47,166 --> 00:07:50,670
That's what you were going to say,
wasn't it, dear?

202
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:52,171
Yeah. Yeah, honey, yeah.

203
00:07:52,171 --> 00:07:53,172
Well, I thought it all over

204
00:07:53,172 --> 00:07:55,174
and there's only one thing for us to
do.

205
00:07:55,675 --> 00:07:56,676
What's that, honey?

206
00:07:56,676 --> 00:07:58,678
Get married again right away.

207
00:07:58,678 --> 00:07:59,679
Married again?

208
00:07:59,679 --> 00:08:00,680
Of course!

209
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,682
Oh, isn't this exciting!

210
00:08:02,682 --> 00:08:04,183
And I don't want anything

211
00:08:04,183 --> 00:08:06,686
to spoil my memories of our first
marriage--

212
00:08:06,686 --> 00:08:09,689
the one that didn't take.

213
00:08:09,689 --> 00:08:12,191
So we're going to do the whole thing
over again

214
00:08:12,191 --> 00:08:15,194
exactly as we did before, starting
with the proposal.

215
00:08:15,194 --> 00:08:17,697
You mean we got to go all the way

216
00:08:17,697 --> 00:08:19,198
up to Connecticut?

217
00:08:19,198 --> 00:08:20,700
You mean you don't want to?

218
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:22,201
Oh, yeah, honey, sure, I want to.

219
00:08:22,201 --> 00:08:24,203
Yeah, baby, I'd like to do it.
Okay.

220
00:08:24,203 --> 00:08:26,205
Okay, we'll start the first thing in
the morning.

221
00:08:26,205 --> 00:08:27,707
We'll find that same little bench

222
00:08:27,707 --> 00:08:29,208
and you'll propose in the same way

223
00:08:29,208 --> 00:08:31,711
and we'll be married by the same
justice of the peace

224
00:08:31,711 --> 00:08:34,213
and we'll stay overnight at the Byram
River Beagle Club

225
00:08:34,213 --> 00:08:37,216
and-and we'll do everything just the
way we did before.

226
00:08:37,216 --> 00:08:38,718
Honey, it's 125 miles

227
00:08:38,718 --> 00:08:40,720
to the Beagle Byram River Club

228
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:43,222
and I got a rehearsal the next
morning.

229
00:08:43,222 --> 00:08:45,224
Well, we'll get back in plenty of
time.

230
00:08:45,224 --> 00:08:46,225
Come on, Ethel.

231
00:08:46,225 --> 00:08:47,727
Good night, Ricky.

232
00:08:47,727 --> 00:08:49,228
Lucy, where are you going?

233
00:08:49,228 --> 00:08:50,229
Pardon me.

234
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:51,731
My dear Mr. Ricardo

235
00:08:51,731 --> 00:08:54,734
surely you don't expect me to stay
here.

236
00:08:55,234 --> 00:08:57,236
You're a bachelor, remember?

237
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:02,241
Lucy, now wait a minute.

238
00:09:02,241 --> 00:09:03,743
Lucy!

239
00:09:04,744 --> 00:09:09,248
You got to have a friend down at the
License Bureau.

240
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:19,809
LUCY: Well, I know it's around in
here someplace, Ricky.

241
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:22,311
It's got to be, because I know...

242
00:09:22,311 --> 00:09:25,815
Oh, here it is! Here it is, the same
little bench.

243
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:27,316
I told you it was in here.

244
00:09:27,316 --> 00:09:28,317
Come on, Ricky!

245
00:09:28,317 --> 00:09:29,819
Coming, coming.

246
00:09:38,327 --> 00:09:41,831
Well, the least you could do is help
me with this stuff.

247
00:09:41,831 --> 00:09:43,833
Why do you make me carry everything?

248
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:45,334
Before we were married

249
00:09:45,334 --> 00:09:47,837
you insisted on carrying everything,
remember?

250
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:48,838
Oh, yeah.

251
00:09:55,845 --> 00:09:56,846
Oh, honey!

252
00:10:07,857 --> 00:10:09,358
Gee, I don't remember

253
00:10:09,358 --> 00:10:11,861
this seat being so small, do you?

254
00:10:11,861 --> 00:10:15,364
I guess the trees grew in a little
from each side.

255
00:10:15,364 --> 00:10:17,366
Let's face it.

256
00:10:17,366 --> 00:10:20,369
We've grown out a little from each
side.

257
00:10:22,872 --> 00:10:27,877
Gee, doesn't just being here make you
feel romantic, Ricky?

258
00:10:27,877 --> 00:10:28,878
Yeah.

259
00:10:28,878 --> 00:10:29,879
Let's eat, huh?

260
00:10:33,382 --> 00:10:34,884
The last time you were here

261
00:10:34,884 --> 00:10:36,886
you said, "Who needs food?

262
00:10:36,886 --> 00:10:38,888
I want to feast on your beauty."

263
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:39,889
Oh. Who needs food?

264
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:42,391
I want to feast on your beauty.

265
00:10:43,893 --> 00:10:45,895
You bring any mustard?

266
00:10:47,396 --> 00:10:49,899
Somehow, it sounds different than it
did then.

267
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:51,901
Honey, what you want to start with--

268
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:53,903
chicken salad or peanut butter?

269
00:10:53,903 --> 00:10:57,406
I want to start with a proposal.

270
00:10:57,406 --> 00:10:59,408
Before we eat?

271
00:11:00,409 --> 00:11:03,913
Now, Ricky, down on your knee.

272
00:11:03,913 --> 00:11:05,915
Oh, honey, the ground is all wet.

273
00:11:05,915 --> 00:11:07,416
Down on your knee.

274
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:08,918
Now, I want everything

275
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:10,419
just the way it was before.

276
00:11:10,419 --> 00:11:12,421
All right, honey, all right.

277
00:11:12,421 --> 00:11:13,923
Okay.

278
00:11:13,923 --> 00:11:15,925
Down on my knees.

279
00:11:17,927 --> 00:11:19,929
You know, I even took your wallet

280
00:11:20,429 --> 00:11:22,431
out of your pocket and left it home.

281
00:11:22,431 --> 00:11:24,433
My wallet? Why?
What did you do that for?

282
00:11:24,934 --> 00:11:25,935
Don't you remember?

283
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:27,937
That day you left your wallet at home

284
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:29,939
and I had to pay for the license.

285
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:31,440
Oh, yeah.

286
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,443
Well, go ahead with the proposal.

287
00:11:34,443 --> 00:11:35,444
Uh...

288
00:11:35,444 --> 00:11:36,946
You took my hand...

289
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:38,948
Oh.

290
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:40,950
Uh...

291
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:41,951
um...

292
00:11:42,451 --> 00:11:44,954
Lucy, I love you madly.

293
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:47,456
Lucy, I love you madly.

294
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:51,961
Lucy, I can't live without you.

295
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:53,963
Lucy, I can't live without you.

296
00:11:53,963 --> 00:11:55,965
Why did you take my wallet?

297
00:11:55,965 --> 00:11:58,467
Now I don't have my driver's license!

298
00:12:02,471 --> 00:12:04,974
I know-- I know I don't deserve

299
00:12:04,974 --> 00:12:06,976
a wonderful girl like you.

300
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:08,477
I know I don't deserve...

301
00:12:08,477 --> 00:12:09,478
Take my hand.

302
00:12:09,478 --> 00:12:11,480
Oh. I know I don't deserve

303
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,982
a wonderful girl like you.

304
00:12:12,982 --> 00:12:15,484
Lucy, will you marry me?

305
00:12:16,986 --> 00:12:18,988
Lucy, will you marry me?

306
00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:20,990
What's the matter?

307
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:23,993
Well, this is a pretty important step

308
00:12:24,493 --> 00:12:25,995
in my life.

309
00:12:25,995 --> 00:12:28,497
I don't want to be rushed into
anything.

310
00:12:28,497 --> 00:12:29,999
What?!

311
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:32,001
It's a good thing to know where I
stand.

312
00:12:32,001 --> 00:12:34,003
Honey, I was just kidding you.

313
00:12:34,003 --> 00:12:35,004
Come on, sit down.

314
00:12:35,004 --> 00:12:36,505
No!
Come on, sit down,

315
00:12:36,505 --> 00:12:39,008
I'll propose, honey. Come on.
Never mind.

316
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:41,510
Oh, come on, honey.
Let me do it right.

317
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:43,012
Sit down, I'll propose.
No.

318
00:12:43,012 --> 00:12:44,513
It's a pretty big step for me, too

319
00:12:44,513 --> 00:12:46,015
and I don't want to be rushed into
anything.

320
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:47,516
Well, honey, can't you...

321
00:12:47,516 --> 00:12:49,018
can't you take a joke?

322
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:52,021
What's funny about your not wanting
to marry me?

323
00:12:52,021 --> 00:12:54,023
Oh, honey, I do want to marry you. I
do...

324
00:12:54,023 --> 00:12:55,024
You do not. You do not.

325
00:12:55,024 --> 00:12:56,525
The real truth slips out.

326
00:12:56,525 --> 00:12:58,527
Oh, now, Lucy, baby.

327
00:12:58,527 --> 00:13:00,529
Don't "Lucy baby" me!

328
00:13:00,529 --> 00:13:02,531
From now on, I'm Miss MacGillicuddy
to you.

329
00:13:02,531 --> 00:13:04,033
and for your information

330
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:06,035
I wouldn't marry you if you were
Xavier Cugat!

331
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:10,039
Lucy!

332
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:11,540
Honey, look!

333
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:13,542
Xavier Cugat?!

334
00:13:13,542 --> 00:13:14,543
Lucy!

335
00:13:21,584 --> 00:13:23,085
"The Eagle Hotel." I don't know why

336
00:13:23,085 --> 00:13:25,087
you couldn't remember to put gas in
the car.

337
00:13:25,087 --> 00:13:27,089
Even if I had remembered, I couldn't
have paid for it.

338
00:13:27,089 --> 00:13:28,591
You took my wallet.

339
00:13:28,591 --> 00:13:29,592
That's no excuse.

340
00:13:29,592 --> 00:13:31,093
No excuse.

341
00:13:32,094 --> 00:13:34,597
Isn't there anybody alive in this
town?

342
00:13:34,597 --> 00:13:35,598
What town?

343
00:13:35,598 --> 00:13:36,599
(rings bell)

344
00:13:36,599 --> 00:13:38,100
Fire! Fire!

345
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:39,602
Start the engines pumping!

346
00:13:39,602 --> 00:13:41,103
Where's the ladder?

347
00:13:41,103 --> 00:13:42,104
Get the hose!

348
00:13:42,104 --> 00:13:43,105
Where's the fire?

349
00:13:43,606 --> 00:13:44,607
There is no fire.

350
00:13:44,607 --> 00:13:46,609
Well, I heard the bell.

351
00:13:46,609 --> 00:13:47,610
I saw the flames.

352
00:13:49,111 --> 00:13:53,616
Oh... must have been your hair.

353
00:13:53,616 --> 00:13:55,618
(chuckling)

354
00:13:55,618 --> 00:13:56,619
Well, sir...

355
00:13:56,619 --> 00:13:58,120
what can I do for you?

356
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:01,123
I'm Burt Willoughby, Fire Chief of
this here fair city.

357
00:14:01,123 --> 00:14:03,125
Well, look, Mr. Willoughby

358
00:14:03,125 --> 00:14:05,127
you know that gasoline station across
the street?

359
00:14:05,127 --> 00:14:07,630
There's nobody there.
You know who runs it?

360
00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:08,631
Oh, you're looking

361
00:14:08,631 --> 00:14:11,133
for the man that runs the gas
station.

362
00:14:11,133 --> 00:14:12,134
Yes, sir.

363
00:14:13,135 --> 00:14:15,137
Fill 'er up?

364
00:14:16,138 --> 00:14:18,641
Oh, you run the gas station, too, eh?

365
00:14:18,641 --> 00:14:20,142
Well, we're out of gas.

366
00:14:20,142 --> 00:14:22,144
Too bad, so am I.

367
00:14:22,144 --> 00:14:23,145
What?

368
00:14:23,145 --> 00:14:24,146
Yep, won't get any

369
00:14:24,146 --> 00:14:26,148
till 6:00 tomorrow morning.

370
00:14:26,148 --> 00:14:27,149
Oh... well, I guess

371
00:14:27,149 --> 00:14:30,152
we'll just have to spend the night
here.

372
00:14:30,152 --> 00:14:31,153
Yep.

373
00:14:35,157 --> 00:14:37,159
Sign the register.

374
00:14:40,162 --> 00:14:42,665
"Mister and Missus...

375
00:14:42,665 --> 00:14:44,667
"Ricky...

376
00:14:44,667 --> 00:14:46,168
"Ri... Ri...

377
00:14:46,168 --> 00:14:47,670
Ricardo."

378
00:14:47,670 --> 00:14:49,171
Pardon me, please.

379
00:14:59,181 --> 00:15:03,185
"Miss... Lucille MacGillicuddy."

380
00:15:03,185 --> 00:15:05,688
Good girl.

381
00:15:09,692 --> 00:15:11,193
You cad!

382
00:15:13,195 --> 00:15:15,698
That'll be two rooms--

383
00:15:15,698 --> 00:15:18,200
102, 312.

384
00:15:21,203 --> 00:15:22,705
Oh, what's the difference?

385
00:15:22,705 --> 00:15:25,708
Two floors-- that's the difference.

386
00:15:25,708 --> 00:15:27,710
I'll send a boy out for your luggage.

387
00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:30,212
Oh, well, this is all the luggage
that we have.

388
00:15:30,212 --> 00:15:31,714
Oh, well, in that case

389
00:15:31,714 --> 00:15:33,215
it'll be $4.00 in advance.

390
00:15:33,716 --> 00:15:35,217
Each, that is.

391
00:15:49,231 --> 00:15:50,733
You took my wallet.

392
00:15:50,733 --> 00:15:51,734
I don't have any money.

393
00:15:51,734 --> 00:15:53,235
That's too bad.

394
00:15:53,235 --> 00:15:55,237
Would you show me to my room, please?

395
00:15:55,237 --> 00:15:57,239
What do you mean, "That's too bad"?

396
00:15:57,239 --> 00:15:58,741
Give the man the money, will you?

397
00:15:59,241 --> 00:16:00,743
Why should I pay for your room?

398
00:16:00,743 --> 00:16:01,744
We're not married.

399
00:16:01,744 --> 00:16:03,746
Yeah, why should she?

400
00:16:03,746 --> 00:16:05,748
Now, look, honey, let me explain.

401
00:16:05,748 --> 00:16:09,251
Let me explain the whole thing to
you, will you, please?

402
00:16:09,251 --> 00:16:11,253
The whole thing is a gag, honey.

403
00:16:11,253 --> 00:16:13,255
Now I'll tell you what happened.
Look...

404
00:16:15,257 --> 00:16:17,259
You know, Fred Mertz had a friend.

405
00:16:17,259 --> 00:16:19,762
He had a friend down at the License
Bureau, see?

406
00:16:19,762 --> 00:16:22,264
So I asked him to tell his friend to
tell you

407
00:16:22,264 --> 00:16:23,265
when you got down there

408
00:16:23,766 --> 00:16:25,267
that the license was no good

409
00:16:25,267 --> 00:16:27,269
and that we were not married at all.

410
00:16:27,269 --> 00:16:29,271
That's what I told him

411
00:16:29,271 --> 00:16:30,272
and he did it, you know?

412
00:16:30,272 --> 00:16:31,774
Isn't that funny?

413
00:16:35,778 --> 00:16:38,280
That's the phoniest story I've ever
heard.

414
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:40,783
That's the phoniest story I have ever
heard

415
00:16:40,783 --> 00:16:42,284
and I've heard them all.

416
00:16:45,287 --> 00:16:47,289
Now, Lucy, for goodness' sake...

417
00:16:47,289 --> 00:16:48,290
Uh-uh.

418
00:16:48,290 --> 00:16:50,793
Please, stop annoying our paying
guest.

419
00:16:50,793 --> 00:16:52,795
I'll have a bell boy take you

420
00:16:52,795 --> 00:16:54,797
right up to your room, young lady.

421
00:16:54,797 --> 00:16:56,298
Thank you.

422
00:16:56,298 --> 00:16:57,800
Front!

423
00:17:03,305 --> 00:17:05,307
Oh, are you the bell boy, too?

424
00:17:05,808 --> 00:17:07,309
Why, sure.

425
00:17:07,309 --> 00:17:10,312
Call for Philip...

426
00:17:11,313 --> 00:17:13,816
Gosh, I've heard that a thousand
times

427
00:17:13,816 --> 00:17:16,819
but I just can't remember what that
fellow's last name is.

428
00:17:17,319 --> 00:17:18,821
Follow me.

429
00:17:48,016 --> 00:17:49,518
What happened? What? What?

430
00:17:49,518 --> 00:17:51,520
Good morning.

431
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,522
Good morning.

432
00:17:54,523 --> 00:17:57,025
Well, she's all filled with gasoline
and raring to go.

433
00:17:57,025 --> 00:17:58,527
Good. Let's get out of here.

434
00:17:58,527 --> 00:18:00,028
Gee, we're just in time to go to New
York

435
00:18:00,028 --> 00:18:01,530
in time for rehearsal.
Let's go.

436
00:18:01,530 --> 00:18:03,031
(clears throat)

437
00:18:03,031 --> 00:18:04,533
Just a minute.

438
00:18:04,533 --> 00:18:06,535
That gasoline came to $3.25.

439
00:18:06,535 --> 00:18:08,537
Well?

440
00:18:08,537 --> 00:18:09,538
Well?

441
00:18:09,538 --> 00:18:10,539
Well, give him the money.

442
00:18:10,539 --> 00:18:11,540
You certainly don't expect me

443
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:13,041
to pay for the gas, do you?

444
00:18:13,041 --> 00:18:14,543
Well, you better give the man the
money

445
00:18:14,543 --> 00:18:17,045
or neither one of us is going to get
back in town.

446
00:18:17,045 --> 00:18:18,547
LUCY: Well, it doesn't matter to me.

447
00:18:18,547 --> 00:18:19,548
I have no pressing engagements.

448
00:18:19,548 --> 00:18:20,549
But, honey, I have...

449
00:18:20,549 --> 00:18:23,552
I'm the sheriff.

450
00:18:23,552 --> 00:18:26,555
I just had a call from the gas
station.

451
00:18:26,555 --> 00:18:29,057
Which one of you is the deadbeat?

452
00:18:29,057 --> 00:18:30,559
He's your man, Officer.

453
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:31,560
All righty.

454
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:34,062
Well, I guess you're going to jail.

455
00:18:34,062 --> 00:18:35,063
Jail?!

456
00:18:35,063 --> 00:18:36,064
Yep.

457
00:18:36,064 --> 00:18:37,065
Wait a minute.

458
00:18:37,065 --> 00:18:38,567
Un momento, caballero.

459
00:18:38,567 --> 00:18:39,568
Me deje explicar.

460
00:18:39,568 --> 00:18:41,570
Estamos casado hace diez anos.

461
00:18:41,570 --> 00:18:43,572
Ella esta completamente loca.

462
00:18:43,572 --> 00:18:45,574
Me quiere poner en la carcel.

463
00:18:45,574 --> 00:18:48,076
Aha! A spy!

464
00:18:48,076 --> 00:18:50,078
A spy?!

465
00:18:50,078 --> 00:18:51,079
Just a minute.

466
00:18:51,079 --> 00:18:52,581
Just a minute, Mr. Willoughby.

467
00:18:53,081 --> 00:18:54,082
Uh, he isn't a spy.

468
00:18:54,082 --> 00:18:55,584
Well, you don't kid me.

469
00:18:55,584 --> 00:18:57,085
I know Russian when I hear it.

470
00:18:58,587 --> 00:19:01,590
Well, that wasn't Russian, that was
Spanish.

471
00:19:01,590 --> 00:19:03,592
Spanish? Well, we licked them in '98

472
00:19:03,592 --> 00:19:05,093
and by golly, we can do it again.

473
00:19:05,093 --> 00:19:07,095
Come on.

474
00:19:07,095 --> 00:19:09,097
Look, you better give this character
his money

475
00:19:09,097 --> 00:19:10,599
or he's going to have me shot.

476
00:19:10,599 --> 00:19:12,601
Why should I care what happens to you

477
00:19:12,601 --> 00:19:14,603
when you don't care enough about me
to marry me?

478
00:19:14,603 --> 00:19:16,104
Yeah.

479
00:19:16,104 --> 00:19:19,107
Say, why don't you marry that little
lady?

480
00:19:19,107 --> 00:19:20,108
Well, I would marry her

481
00:19:20,108 --> 00:19:21,610
but she wouldn't marry me.

482
00:19:22,110 --> 00:19:23,111
No?
No.

483
00:19:23,111 --> 00:19:24,613
Anyway, I don't even have money

484
00:19:24,613 --> 00:19:26,114
to pay the justice of the peace.

485
00:19:26,114 --> 00:19:27,616
Well, maybe if you talk right nice
like

486
00:19:27,616 --> 00:19:30,118
the justice of the peace might do it
for nothing.

487
00:19:30,118 --> 00:19:31,620
Yeah? Well, you know where I can find
him?

488
00:19:37,125 --> 00:19:39,127
Where's the happy couple?

489
00:19:43,632 --> 00:19:48,136
You know, the real money in this town
is selling hats.

490
00:19:50,138 --> 00:19:52,641
Look, Mr. Willoughby, can we rush
this thing?

491
00:19:52,641 --> 00:19:55,143
I'm in a terrible hurry to get back
into town.

492
00:19:55,143 --> 00:19:57,145
Young man, this is serious business.

493
00:19:57,145 --> 00:19:59,648
You just can't rush into marriage,
you know.

494
00:19:59,648 --> 00:20:01,650
Now, let's see...
we need a witness.

495
00:20:03,151 --> 00:20:05,153
Mother!

496
00:20:05,153 --> 00:20:06,154
WOMAN: Yes?

497
00:20:06,655 --> 00:20:08,156
That's Mrs. Willoughby.

498
00:20:08,156 --> 00:20:09,157
I call her "Mother."

499
00:20:09,157 --> 00:20:12,160
Look, can we get started now, please?

500
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:14,162
I'm in a terrible rush.

501
00:20:14,162 --> 00:20:16,665
Look, I'm not going to marry you

502
00:20:16,665 --> 00:20:18,166
until you propose.

503
00:20:18,166 --> 00:20:20,669
In front of Mr. Willoughby?

504
00:20:20,669 --> 00:20:23,171
Oh, go on, please.

505
00:20:23,171 --> 00:20:25,173
Go ahead, Ricky.

506
00:20:25,173 --> 00:20:26,174
All right.

507
00:20:26,174 --> 00:20:27,175
Lucy...

508
00:20:27,175 --> 00:20:29,177
Down on your knee.

509
00:20:31,179 --> 00:20:32,180
Lucy, will you...

510
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:34,182
Oh, wait!
Wait just a minute.

511
00:20:34,182 --> 00:20:35,684
I want Mother to see this.

512
00:20:35,684 --> 00:20:36,685
Mother!

513
00:20:38,687 --> 00:20:39,688
Hurry up, please.

514
00:20:39,688 --> 00:20:40,689
Goodness!

515
00:20:40,689 --> 00:20:42,190
Well, don't hurry me.

516
00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:43,692
I want you to hear this.

517
00:20:43,692 --> 00:20:45,193
This young gentleman here

518
00:20:45,193 --> 00:20:48,196
is just about to pop the question to
the lady.

519
00:20:48,196 --> 00:20:49,698
Oh...

520
00:20:49,698 --> 00:20:52,701
All right, Ricky, start popping.

521
00:20:52,701 --> 00:20:54,202
Lucy...

522
00:20:57,205 --> 00:20:58,206
Lucy, I...

523
00:21:01,209 --> 00:21:02,210
Lucy, I think you're

524
00:21:02,210 --> 00:21:04,212
the most wonderful girl in the world.

525
00:21:04,212 --> 00:21:06,214
I can't live without you.
Lucy, will you marry me?

526
00:21:07,716 --> 00:21:09,217
Yes, I will.

527
00:21:09,217 --> 00:21:10,719
How sweet!

528
00:21:10,719 --> 00:21:11,720
All right.

529
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:13,722
Now, can we get going now, please?

530
00:21:13,722 --> 00:21:14,723
All righty.

531
00:21:14,723 --> 00:21:16,725
Now, Mother, take your place.

532
00:21:16,725 --> 00:21:19,227
Now, you two just get right...
No, you're on the other side.

533
00:21:19,227 --> 00:21:20,729
Mother, please!

534
00:21:20,729 --> 00:21:23,231
Well, I don't know where...

535
00:21:23,231 --> 00:21:25,233
For all the times you've done this...

536
00:21:25,233 --> 00:21:27,736
For goodness' sake, now, stand still,
will you?

537
00:21:27,736 --> 00:21:28,737
All right.

538
00:21:28,737 --> 00:21:30,739
Oh, I just had a terrible thought.

539
00:21:30,739 --> 00:21:32,240
We can't get married.

540
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:33,742
We don't have a license.

541
00:21:33,742 --> 00:21:36,244
Oh, don't worry about that.

542
00:21:36,244 --> 00:21:37,245
I know.

543
00:21:37,245 --> 00:21:39,748
You're the head of the License
Bureau.

544
00:21:39,748 --> 00:21:41,750
Oh, no, I'm not, smarty.

545
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:43,251
I am.

546
00:21:44,753 --> 00:21:45,754
Mrs. Willoughby

547
00:21:45,754 --> 00:21:48,256
would you make the license out right
away?

548
00:21:48,256 --> 00:21:49,758
And I'll be right back.

549
00:21:49,758 --> 00:21:51,760
Lucy, where are you going?

550
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:52,761
You'll see.

551
00:21:52,761 --> 00:21:55,263
I want everything to be just the way
it was before.

552
00:22:01,770 --> 00:22:03,772
Come on, honey, aren't you ready yet?

553
00:22:03,772 --> 00:22:04,773
Come on, Lucy.

554
00:22:14,783 --> 00:22:18,787
Lucy, you look so beautiful.

555
00:22:18,787 --> 00:22:20,288
Will you marry me?

556
00:22:20,288 --> 00:22:21,790
Yes.

557
00:22:21,790 --> 00:22:25,293
Well, I guess we're all set.

558
00:22:26,294 --> 00:22:28,296
You're on the wrong side.

559
00:22:28,296 --> 00:22:29,297
Oh.

560
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:35,187
We have a beautiful ceremony, we do.

561
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:37,689
We start with a song.

562
00:22:37,689 --> 00:22:38,690
Hit it, Mother.

563
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:40,192
(plays a note)

564
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:41,693
(singing off-pitch)

565
00:22:41,693 --> 00:22:49,201
I... I love you truly, truly, dear

566
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:55,207
Life with its sorrows, life with its
tear

567
00:22:55,207 --> 00:23:01,713
Fades into dreams when I feel you are
near

568
00:23:01,713 --> 00:23:08,720
For I love you truly, truly, dear

569
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,222
Thank you, Mrs. Willoughby.

570
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:11,723
Very nice, very nice.

571
00:23:11,723 --> 00:23:18,230
Ah, love, 'tis something to feel your
kind hand

572
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:20,232
Ah, yes, 'tis something...

573
00:23:20,232 --> 00:23:21,233
Mother.

574
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:23,235
Beside you to stand...

575
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:24,736
Mother.

576
00:23:24,736 --> 00:23:27,239
Gone are the dreams...

577
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:29,241
Mother!

578
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:31,243
That's all, Mother.

579
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:33,745
Don't I even get to sing the second
verse?

580
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:35,247
No.

581
00:23:35,247 --> 00:23:36,248
Oh, nuts!

582
00:23:40,752 --> 00:23:42,254
There's your certificate.

583
00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:43,755
Now you're all legally married.

584
00:23:43,755 --> 00:23:45,757
Thank you, Mrs. Willoughby.

585
00:23:45,757 --> 00:23:47,259
Thank you.
Good-bye.

586
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:50,262
Wait, wait, wait!
I forgot something.

587
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:52,264
Whee!

588
00:23:52,264 --> 00:23:53,265
Oh!

589
00:23:53,265 --> 00:23:55,767
Oh, thank you, thank you.

590
00:23:55,767 --> 00:23:57,269
Thank you.

591
00:23:57,269 --> 00:23:58,770
Not so fast.

592
00:23:58,770 --> 00:24:03,275
Do you own that car parked out there
at the curb?

593
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:05,277
You know I do-- you just filled it up
with gas

594
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:06,278
a couple of hours ago.

595
00:24:06,778 --> 00:24:09,781
Do you realize that you've parked 12
hours

596
00:24:09,781 --> 00:24:11,283
in a one-hour zone?

597
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:13,785
Ten dollars or ten days.

598
00:24:13,785 --> 00:24:16,288
But we just gave you all the money we
had

599
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:17,789
to pay for the gas.

600
00:24:17,789 --> 00:24:19,791
Ten dollars or ten days.

601
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:21,793
Just a minute, Burt.

602
00:24:21,793 --> 00:24:24,296
You young folks just run right along

603
00:24:24,296 --> 00:24:26,298
and forget what he said.

604
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:27,799
Mother, please!

605
00:24:27,799 --> 00:24:30,802
Are you forgetting you're talking to
the sheriff?

606
00:24:30,802 --> 00:24:35,807
Father, you're forgetting I'm the
mayor.

What was that?

It was on the ceiling.

8
00:01:08,151 --> 00:01:09,652
I'm trying to learn

9
00:01:09,652 --> 00:01:11,654
to flip pancakes up in the air

10
00:01:11,654 --> 00:01:13,656

Boy, am I glad to get it off my
hands.

14
00:01:19,662 --> 00:01:20,663
What is all that?

15
00:01:20,663 --> 00:01:22,665
What are you trying to do-- bribe me?

16
00:01:22,665 --> 00:01:24,167
The club treasurer asked me

17

00:01:25,168 --> 00:01:26,669
Oh, for the bazaar.

19
00:01:26,669 --> 00:01:27,670
Yeah. You're supposed to use it

20
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:29,172
to rent the hall and buy the
refreshments

21
00:01:29,172 --> 00:01:30,173
have the posters printed...

00:01:32,175 --> 00:01:33,676
I don't want Ricky to hear.

25
00:01:33,676 --> 00:01:34,677
Lucy

26
00:01:34,677 --> 00:01:38,181
haven't you told him you're chairman
of the bazaar?

27
00:01:38,181 --> 00:01:40,183
No, and I'm not going to tell him
till next Friday.

28
00:01:40,183 --> 00:01:41,684
But the bazaar's next Thursday.

29
00:01:41,684 --> 00:01:43,186
Exactly.

30
00:01:43,186 --> 00:01:45,188
You sure live dangerously, Lucy.

31
00:01:45,188 --> 00:01:46,189
Well, after what happened

32
00:01:46,189 --> 00:01:48,191
at the Fourth of July carnival last
year

33
00:01:48,191 --> 00:01:49,692
Ricky made me promise

34
00:01:49,692 --> 00:01:51,194
that I wouldn't get mixed up

35
00:01:51,194 --> 00:01:52,695
in any more club affairs.

36
00:01:52,695 --> 00:01:53,696
I don't blame him.

37
00:01:53,696 --> 00:01:55,198
You weren't very bright

38
00:01:55,198 --> 00:01:56,699
throwing all those skyrockets

39
00:01:56,699 --> 00:01:58,701
and Roman candles in a fireplace.

40
00:01:58,701 --> 00:02:01,204
Well, who uses a fireplace in July?

41
00:02:01,204 --> 00:02:02,705
He should have looked

42
00:02:02,705 --> 00:02:04,707
before he threw that match in there.

43
00:02:04,707 --> 00:02:06,209
Poor Ricky.

44
00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:08,711
His eyebrows didn't grow in for a
month.

45
00:02:10,213 --> 00:02:15,218
You remember those little baby
toupees he wore over each eye?

46
00:02:15,218 --> 00:02:17,720
Say, where are you hiding all the
stuff

47
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:20,223
that's been donated to the bazaar
auction?

48
00:02:20,223 --> 00:02:22,225
I'll show you.

49
00:02:29,732 --> 00:02:31,734
What a treasure trove!

50
00:02:31,734 --> 00:02:33,736
Shh!

51
00:02:42,245 --> 00:02:44,247
(whispering inaudibly)

52
00:02:44,747 --> 00:02:46,249
Say, when we sell that

53
00:02:46,249 --> 00:02:48,251
the club will have nothing but money.

54
00:02:48,251 --> 00:02:50,753
And I've got a slew of stuff to
collect.

55
00:02:50,753 --> 00:02:53,256
I'm going out as soon as Ricky
leaves.

56
00:02:53,256 --> 00:02:54,257
RICKY: Lucy!

57
00:02:54,257 --> 00:02:55,258
Yeah, dear?

58
00:02:55,258 --> 00:02:56,259
Ready yet?
Okay, yeah.

59
00:02:56,259 --> 00:02:57,760
I got to run along.

60
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:58,761
So long.

61
00:02:58,761 --> 00:03:00,263
Bye-bye.

62
00:03:00,263 --> 00:03:01,764
Hey! Not a word to Ricky.

63
00:03:01,764 --> 00:03:02,765
Don't worry.

64
00:03:02,765 --> 00:03:03,766
Okay.

65
00:03:03,766 --> 00:03:05,268
Good morning, honey.

66
00:03:05,268 --> 00:03:06,269
Good morning, dear.

67
00:03:08,271 --> 00:03:09,772
Hey!

68
00:03:10,273 --> 00:03:12,275
Tortillas.

69
00:03:15,278 --> 00:03:16,779
Yeah.

70
00:03:16,779 --> 00:03:17,780
I made them

71
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:20,783
out of Aunt Jemima tortilla mix.

72
00:03:20,783 --> 00:03:22,785
Oh, I keep forgetting here in America

73
00:03:23,286 --> 00:03:24,787
you call them flapcakes.

74
00:03:24,787 --> 00:03:27,290
Come again?

75
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:29,292
Hot jacks?

76
00:03:29,292 --> 00:03:31,294
You were closer with tortillas.

77
00:03:31,294 --> 00:03:32,795
They are hot cakes.

78
00:03:32,795 --> 00:03:34,797
Oh.

79
00:03:34,797 --> 00:03:36,299
Not these.

80
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:37,300
These are cold cakes.

81
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:38,801
Oh, honey, I'm sorry.

82
00:03:38,801 --> 00:03:40,303
I'll make you some hot ones.

83
00:03:40,303 --> 00:03:41,804
No, honey, it'll take too long.

84
00:03:41,804 --> 00:03:43,806
I'll just have some coffee.
I'm in a hurry.

85
00:03:43,806 --> 00:03:45,308
Well, I'll make some for myself.

86
00:03:45,308 --> 00:03:46,309
Listen, you got any money?

87
00:03:46,309 --> 00:03:47,810
I haven't got any money for cab fare.

88
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:49,812
I don't know. There's my bag over
there on the shelf.

89
00:03:49,812 --> 00:03:51,814
Thanks.

90
00:03:51,814 --> 00:03:53,316
Oh, honey, I just remembered--

91
00:03:53,316 --> 00:03:54,817
no, I don't have any money.

92
00:03:54,817 --> 00:03:56,319
I don't have a cent in there, honey.

93
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:57,320
Give me my bag.

94
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,321
Wait a... wait...

95
00:03:58,321 --> 00:03:59,322
I don't have a cent.

96
00:03:59,322 --> 00:04:00,323
Wait a minute.

97
00:04:00,323 --> 00:04:02,825
What are you getting so excited
about?

98
00:04:02,825 --> 00:04:03,826
Let's see what's in here.

99
00:04:05,328 --> 00:04:07,830
Wow.

100
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:10,833
What is this?

101
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:14,337
Uh...
it's my mad money.

102
00:04:14,337 --> 00:04:18,841
150... 160...
170... $200 here.

103
00:04:18,841 --> 00:04:22,345
Yeah, I get awful mad.

104
00:04:22,345 --> 00:04:23,846
Lucy.

105
00:04:23,846 --> 00:04:25,348
Where did you get this money?

106
00:04:25,348 --> 00:04:29,852
Uh... I saved it out of my allowance?

107
00:04:29,852 --> 00:04:31,354
No?

108
00:04:33,856 --> 00:04:34,857
No.

109
00:04:34,857 --> 00:04:35,858
Uh...

110
00:04:35,858 --> 00:04:36,859
No.

111
00:04:36,859 --> 00:04:38,361
Ew...

112
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:39,862
Now, Lucy, this is no joke.

113
00:04:39,862 --> 00:04:41,364
There's a lot of money here.

114
00:04:41,364 --> 00:04:43,366
I want to know where you got it.

115
00:04:43,366 --> 00:04:45,368
Ricky, you said you were late for
work.

116
00:04:45,368 --> 00:04:47,870
Now, Lucy, I want to know where you
got that money.

117
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:48,871
Did you earn it?

118
00:04:48,871 --> 00:04:50,373
Did you borrow it?

119
00:04:50,373 --> 00:04:51,374
Did you steal it?

120
00:04:51,374 --> 00:04:52,375
Yeah, that's it.

121
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:53,376
Which one?

122
00:04:53,376 --> 00:04:56,379
Oh, it doesn't matter-- any one of
them.

123
00:04:56,379 --> 00:04:57,880
Now, Lucy.

124
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:58,881
All right.

125
00:04:58,881 --> 00:05:01,884
You'll find out sooner or later
anyway.

126
00:05:01,884 --> 00:05:02,885
I stole it.

127
00:05:02,885 --> 00:05:03,886
What?

128
00:05:03,886 --> 00:05:05,388
Well, I'm sorry-- I saw it

129
00:05:05,388 --> 00:05:07,390
and I just couldn't help myself.

130
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:09,892
Now, Lucy, you're not telling me the
truth.

131
00:05:10,393 --> 00:05:10,893
Yes, I am.

132
00:05:11,394 --> 00:05:12,395
Word of honor?

133
00:05:12,395 --> 00:05:14,897
Well... what good's a crook's word of
honor?

134
00:05:14,897 --> 00:05:16,899
Look, I haven't got time for jokes
right now

135
00:05:16,899 --> 00:05:19,902
but by the time that I come home this
afternoon

136
00:05:19,902 --> 00:05:21,904
you better have an explanation

137
00:05:21,904 --> 00:05:23,406
of how you got that money,
understand?

138
00:05:23,406 --> 00:05:24,907
Yes, sir.

139
00:05:24,907 --> 00:05:25,908
All right.

140
00:05:25,908 --> 00:05:27,910
I'll take the subway.

141
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:40,340
Lucy?

142
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:43,843
Lucy?

143
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:49,849
Ricky?

144
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:51,411
Lucy?

145
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:52,412
Yeah?
Oh, there you are.

146
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:53,913
How did everything go today?

147
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:55,415
Oh, just wonderful.
I got some wonderful stuff.

148
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:56,416
That's great.

149
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:57,917
But listen, Ethel

150
00:06:57,917 --> 00:06:59,419
Ricky found that bazaar money

151
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:00,920
in my bag this morning.

152
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:01,921
He did?
How did you explain it?

153
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:03,423
Oh, I didn't.

154
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:05,925
I tried to gag my way out by saying I
stole it.

155
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:06,926
Stole it?!

156
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:08,428
Yeah, well, he didn't believe me.

157
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:09,929
Listen, Ethel, can I tell him that it
belongs to you?

158
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:10,930
Huh?

159
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:13,433
Can I tell him the money is yours?

160
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:14,434
Well, if you'll do me a favor.

161
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:15,435
What?

162
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:17,437
Do you think you could auction off

163
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:18,938
that hideous cuckoo clock

164
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:20,940
that Fred won at Coney Island?

165
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:23,443
Well, sure, but Fred would never
donate that.

166
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:24,944
But I've got a scheme.

167
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:27,447
I bought a little clock to donate

168
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:28,948
and I'm going to tell you to go
downstairs and get it.

169
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:31,451
It's on a table next to the cuckoo
clock

170
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:34,454
and you take the cuckoo clock by
mistake, see?

171
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:36,456
After it's auctioned off

172
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:38,458
what can he do about it?

173
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:42,962
Ethel, how could ever think up a
sneaky scheme like that?

174
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:45,465
Who do you think you are-- me?

175
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:49,469
I'll do it.

176
00:08:01,447 --> 00:08:02,949
Fred?

177
00:08:02,949 --> 00:08:03,950
FRED: Yeah.

178
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:05,451
Where are you?

179
00:08:05,451 --> 00:08:06,452
Right here.

180
00:08:06,452 --> 00:08:08,955
I'm trying to fix the leg on this
darn couch.

181
00:08:08,955 --> 00:08:10,957
It keeps coming off all the time.

182
00:08:10,957 --> 00:08:12,458
You want to give me a hand?

183
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:17,463
Listen, Fred, I got an awful problem
on my hands.

184
00:08:17,463 --> 00:08:19,966
You should have thought of that

185
00:08:19,966 --> 00:08:21,467
before you married her.

186
00:08:21,467 --> 00:08:23,469
Look, this is no joke.

187
00:08:23,469 --> 00:08:25,471
This morning I found

188
00:08:25,471 --> 00:08:28,474
a roll of bills in Lucy's purse--
$200.

189
00:08:28,474 --> 00:08:31,477
And just now I saw her sneaking in
the house

190
00:08:31,477 --> 00:08:33,479
carrying some big silver things--

191
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:35,481
real expensive-looking stuff.

192
00:08:35,481 --> 00:08:37,984
Well, there must be some explanation.

193
00:08:37,984 --> 00:08:38,985
I don't think so.

194
00:08:38,985 --> 00:08:40,486
She hid them in the closet.

195
00:08:40,486 --> 00:08:41,487
You know, there must be

196
00:08:41,487 --> 00:08:44,490
thousands of dollars worth of stuff
in that closet

197
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:45,992
that doesn't belong to us.

198
00:08:45,992 --> 00:08:47,994
Gee whiz, you don't suppose

199
00:08:47,994 --> 00:08:49,996
she's a kleptomaniac?

200
00:08:49,996 --> 00:08:54,500
Oh, no, I just think she steals
things.

201
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:57,003
Yeah, that's what a kleptomaniac is--

202
00:08:57,503 --> 00:09:00,506
a person who steal things and can't
help it.

203
00:09:00,506 --> 00:09:02,008
It's a kind of a disease.

204
00:09:02,008 --> 00:09:03,009
Oh, gee.

205
00:09:03,009 --> 00:09:04,510
Oh, you must be mistaken.

206
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:07,013
Come on, help me with this, will you?

207
00:09:07,013 --> 00:09:09,515
Okay.

208
00:09:09,515 --> 00:09:10,516
(hammering)

209
00:09:11,017 --> 00:09:12,018
My God.

210
00:09:12,018 --> 00:09:16,022
LUCY: Fred, are you home?

211
00:09:25,031 --> 00:09:26,532
Fred?

212
00:09:26,532 --> 00:09:28,534
Oh, Fred.

213
00:09:47,053 --> 00:09:48,054
(door closes)

214
00:09:50,056 --> 00:09:51,057
You see!

215
00:09:51,057 --> 00:09:53,059
If I hadn't see it with my own eyes

216
00:09:53,059 --> 00:09:54,560
I'd never believe it.

217
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,062
How do you like that?

218
00:09:56,062 --> 00:09:59,065
She is a klep...
klep... klep...

219
00:09:59,065 --> 00:10:00,066
what you said.

220
00:10:00,066 --> 00:10:02,068
Oh, this is terrible.

221
00:10:02,068 --> 00:10:03,569
I'm married to a thief.

222
00:10:03,569 --> 00:10:07,073
Now, listen, Rick, if she is a
kleptomaniac

223
00:10:07,073 --> 00:10:08,074
it isn't her fault.

224
00:10:08,074 --> 00:10:10,576
She doesn't know what she's doing.

225
00:10:10,576 --> 00:10:13,079
She's just a poor, sick person

226
00:10:13,079 --> 00:10:15,081
and we shouldn't blame her for...

227
00:10:15,581 --> 00:10:18,584
hey, that dirty crook stole my clock!

228
00:10:18,584 --> 00:10:20,086
What am I going to do?

229
00:10:20,086 --> 00:10:21,587
Well, I don't know about you

230
00:10:21,587 --> 00:10:24,090
but I'm going to get my cuckoo clock.

231
00:10:25,591 --> 00:10:28,094
Come on, let's sneak up the back way.

232
00:10:28,094 --> 00:10:29,095
Okay.

233
00:10:29,095 --> 00:10:30,096
Come on.

234
00:10:45,111 --> 00:10:46,612
Hi, fellas.

235
00:10:46,612 --> 00:10:48,114
Hi, Lucy.

236
00:10:48,114 --> 00:10:50,116
Hi, Lucy.

237
00:10:50,116 --> 00:10:51,117
What's new?

238
00:10:51,117 --> 00:10:52,118
Nothing.

239
00:10:52,118 --> 00:10:53,619
If you'll excuse me

240
00:10:53,619 --> 00:10:55,121
I got to go in the bedroom.

241
00:11:09,635 --> 00:11:11,637
Lucy?

242
00:11:11,637 --> 00:11:12,638
Lucy, I want to talk

243
00:11:12,638 --> 00:11:14,140
to you about something, honey.

244
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:15,641
Won't you sit down?

245
00:11:15,641 --> 00:11:16,642
Oh, I'd rather not.

246
00:11:16,642 --> 00:11:18,144
I...

247
00:11:18,144 --> 00:11:19,145
Don't you...

248
00:11:19,145 --> 00:11:20,646
don't you have anything

249
00:11:20,646 --> 00:11:21,647
to tell me?

250
00:11:21,647 --> 00:11:23,149
No.

251
00:11:23,149 --> 00:11:24,650
Aren't you hiding something

252
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:26,152
under your coat?

253
00:11:26,152 --> 00:11:30,656
No, no, that's all me.

254
00:11:30,656 --> 00:11:34,660
Too much pie and cake lately, I
guess.

255
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:36,162
Are you sure?

256
00:11:36,162 --> 00:11:37,663
Yeah, I'm sure.

257
00:11:37,663 --> 00:11:39,665
(clock cuckoos)

258
00:11:42,668 --> 00:11:44,170
What was that?

259
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:45,171
Yeah.

260
00:11:45,171 --> 00:11:46,672
Oh, I did it.

261
00:11:46,672 --> 00:11:48,674
Uh... Cuckoo, cuckoo.

262
00:11:48,674 --> 00:11:51,177
I'm learning to do bird calls.

263
00:11:51,177 --> 00:11:52,678
It didn't sound like you.

264
00:11:52,678 --> 00:11:53,679
Well, it was.

265
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:54,680
(clock cuckoos)

266
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:55,681
I'm... Cuckoo.

267
00:11:55,681 --> 00:11:57,183
I'm... I do...

268
00:11:57,183 --> 00:11:58,684
(clock cuckoos)

269
00:11:58,684 --> 00:12:01,187
...several kinds of bird calls.

270
00:12:01,187 --> 00:12:02,688
Uh... Cuckoo

271
00:12:02,688 --> 00:12:03,689
Bird calls?

272
00:12:03,689 --> 00:12:05,191
Yeah.

273
00:12:05,191 --> 00:12:11,197
(whistles in a high pitch)

274
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:16,702
What was that?

275
00:12:16,702 --> 00:12:21,207
That was a South African
Yellow-Bellied Sapsucker.

276
00:12:22,708 --> 00:12:23,709
(cuckoos)

277
00:12:23,709 --> 00:12:25,211
Cuckoo.

278
00:12:26,712 --> 00:12:28,214
Cuckoo.

279
00:12:28,214 --> 00:12:30,716
Do you know any more bird calls?

280
00:12:30,716 --> 00:12:31,717
Um...

281
00:12:31,717 --> 00:12:34,720
(hums loud and high)

282
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,222
What was that?

283
00:12:36,222 --> 00:12:37,223
A hummingbird.

284
00:12:37,223 --> 00:12:39,725
(clock cuckoos twice)

285
00:12:39,725 --> 00:12:40,726
Cuckoo.

286
00:12:40,726 --> 00:12:41,727
Cuckoo.

287
00:12:41,727 --> 00:12:43,729
You do that cuckoo a lot, don't you?

288
00:12:43,729 --> 00:12:45,731
Well, that's my best one.

289
00:12:45,731 --> 00:12:46,732
(clock cuckoos)

290
00:12:46,732 --> 00:12:47,733
Cuckoo.

291
00:12:48,234 --> 00:12:50,736
Um... I do the English sparrow.

292
00:12:50,736 --> 00:12:52,238
(short whistles)

293
00:12:52,238 --> 00:12:53,239
(clock cuckoos)

294
00:12:53,239 --> 00:12:54,240
Cuckoo.

295
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,741
(short whistles)

296
00:12:55,741 --> 00:12:56,742
Cuckoo.

297
00:12:56,742 --> 00:12:57,743
(whistles)

298
00:12:57,743 --> 00:12:58,744
(clock cuckoos)

299
00:12:58,744 --> 00:13:02,248
It's part sparrow and part cuckoo.

300
00:13:02,248 --> 00:13:05,251
I know someone who's all cuckoo.

301
00:13:05,251 --> 00:13:07,253
I'll see you later, fellas.

302
00:13:08,754 --> 00:13:10,256
I want my cuckoo clock.

303
00:13:10,256 --> 00:13:12,758
Wait, Fred, please.

304
00:13:12,758 --> 00:13:14,760
You'll get your cuckoo clock back
later.

305
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:16,762
The most important thing right now is
Lucy.

306
00:13:16,762 --> 00:13:18,264
Now, come on. Let's go down to your
place.

307
00:13:18,264 --> 00:13:20,266
What are you going to do?

308
00:13:20,266 --> 00:13:21,767
There's only one thing to do.

309
00:13:21,767 --> 00:13:24,270
I'm going to call a "pysaciatrist."

310
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:25,771
What?

311
00:13:25,771 --> 00:13:27,773
A "pysaciatrist."

312
00:13:27,773 --> 00:13:30,276
I'm going to call a head doctor.

313
00:13:30,276 --> 00:13:31,277
I think

314
00:13:31,277 --> 00:13:32,278
you should.

315
00:13:32,278 --> 00:13:34,780
Come on, will you?

316
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:45,574
ETHEL: Lucy?

317
00:13:46,075 --> 00:13:47,076
What?

318
00:13:47,076 --> 00:13:48,077
The most awful thing happened.

319
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:50,079
Fred and Ricky saw you take the
cuckoo clock.

320
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:51,580
They couldn't have.
There was nobody there.

321
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:52,581
Yes, there was.

322
00:13:52,581 --> 00:13:55,084
They were behind the sofa fixing
something.

323
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:57,086
Oh, so that's why they were asking me
all those questions.

324
00:13:57,086 --> 00:13:58,587
And that's not all.

325
00:13:58,587 --> 00:14:00,089
Ricky was hiding in the kitchen

326
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:02,091
and saw you putting all that stuff in
the closet.

327
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:04,093
Oh, and that money this morning.

328
00:14:04,093 --> 00:14:05,594
What must he think?

329
00:14:05,594 --> 00:14:07,596
He thinks you're a kleptomaniac.

330
00:14:07,596 --> 00:14:08,597
What?

331
00:14:08,597 --> 00:14:09,598
A kleptomaniac.

332
00:14:09,598 --> 00:14:11,600
He came down to our apartment

333
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,102
and called a psychiatrist.

334
00:14:13,102 --> 00:14:14,103
I heard him.

335
00:14:14,103 --> 00:14:15,604
He told him all about it.

336
00:14:15,604 --> 00:14:18,107
He's bringing him home with him
tonight.

337
00:14:18,107 --> 00:14:19,108
Oh, he is, is he?

338
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:21,110
A fine, trusting husband to have.

339
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:22,611
Well, I'll show him.

340
00:14:22,611 --> 00:14:24,113
Now, wait a minute, Lucy.

341
00:14:24,113 --> 00:14:25,114
After all

342
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:27,616
Ricky actually saw you taking things.

343
00:14:27,616 --> 00:14:28,617
Sure I've been taking things

344
00:14:29,118 --> 00:14:31,120
but he thinks I've been taking
things.

345
00:14:32,621 --> 00:14:33,622
Oh.

346
00:14:33,622 --> 00:14:35,124
Why don't you tell him

347
00:14:35,124 --> 00:14:36,125
about the bazaar?

348
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:38,127
What, and admit that I'm a liar?

349
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:39,628
Oh, no.

350
00:14:39,628 --> 00:14:41,630
If he wants a wife who's a thief

351
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:43,632
I'll give him a wife who's a thief.

352
00:14:43,632 --> 00:14:45,634
Lucy, what are you hatching?

353
00:14:45,634 --> 00:14:48,137
When Ricky and that psychiatrist

354
00:14:48,137 --> 00:14:49,138
come home tonight

355
00:14:49,138 --> 00:14:52,641
we are going to be playing a little
play

356
00:14:52,641 --> 00:14:55,644
starring Lucy the Lip and Babyface
Ethel.

357
00:14:55,644 --> 00:14:57,146
Oh, no.

358
00:14:57,146 --> 00:14:59,148
You're not going to get me in on
this.

359
00:14:59,148 --> 00:15:01,650
Listen to me, Babyface.

360
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:05,654
Now, you help me pull this job or
I'll squeal

361
00:15:05,654 --> 00:15:10,159
that you were the brains in the
cuckoo clock caper.

362
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:12,161
Okay, you got me.

363
00:15:12,161 --> 00:15:14,163
What's the deal?

364
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:18,167
Come in, doctor.

365
00:15:18,667 --> 00:15:21,170
Oh, remember, Ricky, not doctor.

366
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:22,671
Oh, that's right... Tom.

367
00:15:23,172 --> 00:15:25,674
Lucy, where are you?

368
00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:28,677
Oh, give me your coat.

369
00:15:28,677 --> 00:15:29,678
Oh, thank you.

370
00:15:29,678 --> 00:15:31,180
Sit down, won't you?

371
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:32,181
Oh, yes, yes, of course.

372
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:34,683
Lucy?

373
00:15:34,683 --> 00:15:37,186
I wonder where she could be.

374
00:15:37,186 --> 00:15:38,187
Well, I...

375
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:39,188
Hi, Rick, you seen Ethel?

376
00:15:39,188 --> 00:15:40,189
No.

377
00:15:40,189 --> 00:15:41,190
Oh, I'm sorry.

378
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:42,191
I didn't know you had company.

379
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:43,192
Oh, that's all right.

380
00:15:43,192 --> 00:15:44,193
This is a very good friend of mine

381
00:15:44,193 --> 00:15:48,197
Dr. Robinson, the "pysaciatrist."

382
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:49,698
This our landlord, Mr. Mertz.

383
00:15:49,698 --> 00:15:50,699
How do you do, Mr. Mertz?

384
00:15:50,699 --> 00:15:51,700
How are you, doctor?

385
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:53,202
Very well, thank you.

386
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:55,704
Listen, don't call him doctor in
front of Lucy.

387
00:15:55,704 --> 00:15:57,706
We want her to think that he's just a
friend.

388
00:15:57,706 --> 00:15:58,707
Oh.

389
00:15:58,707 --> 00:15:59,708
Have you seen Lucy?

390
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:01,210
She's probably with Ethel.

391
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:03,212
Maybe they're out shopping.

392
00:16:03,212 --> 00:16:04,213
Yeah...
or shoplifting.

393
00:16:04,213 --> 00:16:06,715
Well, I hope they'll be home soon.

394
00:16:06,715 --> 00:16:08,717
Would you like a cigarette, doc?

395
00:16:08,717 --> 00:16:10,219
Oh, yes, thank you.

396
00:16:10,219 --> 00:16:14,723
Well, this is the first time I ever
smoked one of these.

397
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:20,729
Gee.

398
00:16:20,729 --> 00:16:22,731
Fred, look at all these jewels.

399
00:16:22,731 --> 00:16:24,733
Sticky fingers strikes again.

400
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:28,237
Wait a minute-- what's the matter
with this chair?

401
00:16:28,237 --> 00:16:29,238
Look at this.

402
00:16:29,238 --> 00:16:31,240
A blowtorch.

403
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,741
A crowball...
a crowbar.

404
00:16:32,741 --> 00:16:34,243
Flash.

405
00:16:34,243 --> 00:16:35,244
This is terrible.

406
00:16:35,244 --> 00:16:37,246
Let me see what this is.

407
00:16:37,246 --> 00:16:38,247
What is it?

408
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:39,248
Oh, no.

409
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:44,253
It's the floor plan of the Chase
National Bank.

410
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:45,754
The 72nd street branch.

411
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:48,757
Why, that's where I keep my money.

412
00:16:48,757 --> 00:16:49,758
This is serious.

413
00:16:49,758 --> 00:16:53,262
Oh, I hope I'm not too late to help
her.

414
00:16:53,262 --> 00:16:55,764
(gunshots)

415
00:16:55,764 --> 00:16:56,765
What's going...

416
00:16:56,765 --> 00:16:58,767
Okay.

417
00:17:04,773 --> 00:17:05,774
Okay?

418
00:17:05,774 --> 00:17:06,775
Okay.

419
00:17:06,775 --> 00:17:08,277
Did you get any of them?

420
00:17:08,277 --> 00:17:10,279
Yeah, I got two, a flatfoot and a
private eye.

421
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:11,780
I got the eye in the foot

422
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:13,282
and the foot in the eye.

423
00:17:16,785 --> 00:17:19,288
I winged a couple myself.

424
00:17:19,288 --> 00:17:20,789
Oh, hiya, Ricky.

425
00:17:20,789 --> 00:17:22,291
Hiya, Lucy.

426
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:23,792
Hi, Ethel.

427
00:17:23,792 --> 00:17:25,794
Hi, fatso.

428
00:17:28,297 --> 00:17:30,799
Who's the geek?

429
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:34,803
Eh, Lucy, this is a very good friend
of mine

430
00:17:34,803 --> 00:17:35,804
T... Tom Robinson.

431
00:17:35,804 --> 00:17:39,308
This is my wife, Lucy, and that's
Mrs. Mertz.

432
00:17:39,308 --> 00:17:40,809
Oh, how do you do, my dear?

433
00:17:44,813 --> 00:17:46,315
RICKY: Lucy!

434
00:17:46,315 --> 00:17:47,316
What are you doing?

435
00:17:47,316 --> 00:17:48,817
Just frisking him

436
00:17:48,817 --> 00:17:50,819
to see if he's carrying a rod.

437
00:17:50,819 --> 00:17:51,820
Hiya, Tom.

438
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:53,322
Oh, how do... ouch!

439
00:17:53,322 --> 00:17:55,824
Oh, pardon the brass knuckles.

440
00:18:00,829 --> 00:18:03,832
Lucy, where have you been?

441
00:18:03,832 --> 00:18:05,334
Chase National Bank.

442
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:07,336
Oh, no.

443
00:18:07,336 --> 00:18:08,337
You did it!

444
00:18:08,337 --> 00:18:12,341
Nah, stupid here forgot the map and
the torch.

445
00:18:12,341 --> 00:18:13,842
I'm sorry, brain.

446
00:18:13,842 --> 00:18:15,844
Yeah... another slip like that

447
00:18:15,844 --> 00:18:17,846
and it'll be curtains for you.

448
00:18:17,846 --> 00:18:19,348
Oh, it won't happen again.

449
00:18:19,348 --> 00:18:20,349
I promise, brain.

450
00:18:20,849 --> 00:18:21,850
Aah, shut up.

451
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:23,852
FRED: If you forgot the map...

452
00:18:23,852 --> 00:18:24,853
If you forgot the map

453
00:18:24,853 --> 00:18:26,855
where'd you get that bag of dough?

454
00:18:26,855 --> 00:18:29,358
Well, just so the evening wouldn't be
a total loss

455
00:18:29,358 --> 00:18:30,859
we knocked over a gas station

456
00:18:30,859 --> 00:18:31,860
on the way home.

457
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:34,863
Oh, no, no, no...

458
00:18:34,863 --> 00:18:37,366
What are you yapping about, tubby?

459
00:18:37,366 --> 00:18:40,369
It beats running this crummy
apartment house.

460
00:18:40,369 --> 00:18:41,370
Now, what are you...

461
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:42,871
listen, come to your senses

462
00:18:42,871 --> 00:18:43,872
will ya, Ethel?

463
00:18:47,876 --> 00:18:49,878
Oh...

464
00:18:49,878 --> 00:18:52,381
so you're holding out on me, eh,
Babyface?

465
00:18:52,881 --> 00:18:55,384
This gang ain't big enough for the
both of us.

466
00:18:55,384 --> 00:18:56,885
No, I'm too young to die.

467
00:18:56,885 --> 00:18:57,886
(screams)

468
00:18:57,886 --> 00:18:58,887
Mrs. Ricardo.

469
00:18:58,887 --> 00:18:59,888
Yeah?
Mrs. Ricardo...

470
00:18:59,888 --> 00:19:00,889
Yeah.

471
00:19:00,889 --> 00:19:04,393
Look me straight in the eye.

472
00:19:04,393 --> 00:19:05,394
Yeah?

473
00:19:05,394 --> 00:19:08,897
Mrs. Ricardo, you don't hate anyone.

474
00:19:08,897 --> 00:19:11,400
You're at peace with all the world.

475
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:14,903
You love everybody.

476
00:19:14,903 --> 00:19:17,406
Yeah?

477
00:19:17,406 --> 00:19:19,408
Yes.

478
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:21,410
And you're tired.

479
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:26,415
You're feeling very tired, aren't
you?

480
00:19:26,415 --> 00:19:28,917
Yeah.

481
00:19:28,917 --> 00:19:33,422
And you're getting very drowsy.

482
00:19:33,422 --> 00:19:34,923
Yeah.

483
00:19:34,923 --> 00:19:38,927
You feel so very sleepy

484
00:19:38,927 --> 00:19:42,431
and calm and peaceful.

485
00:19:42,431 --> 00:19:44,433
Yeah.

486
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:46,435
Relax.

487
00:19:46,435 --> 00:19:48,937
Relax.

488
00:19:48,937 --> 00:19:51,940
Relax.

489
00:19:53,442 --> 00:19:55,444
That's a good girl.

490
00:19:55,444 --> 00:19:57,446
Right down there.

491
00:19:57,446 --> 00:19:59,448
Um...

492
00:19:59,448 --> 00:20:00,949
oh, uh...

493
00:20:00,949 --> 00:20:04,453
let's put little "Tommy" to bed,
shall we?

494
00:20:06,455 --> 00:20:07,456
Now, Mrs. Ricardo

495
00:20:07,956 --> 00:20:09,458
why don't you tell me

496
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:10,959
how you got started

497
00:20:10,959 --> 00:20:12,461
in this life of crime?

498
00:20:12,461 --> 00:20:14,463
Go back.

499
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:16,965
Go back into your childhood.

500
00:20:16,965 --> 00:20:18,967
Go back.

501
00:20:18,967 --> 00:20:20,969
Back.

502
00:20:20,969 --> 00:20:22,471
Back.

503
00:20:26,975 --> 00:20:31,980
(child's voice): Well, it all started
when I was a little girl.

504
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:34,483
I was riding on the streetcar one day

505
00:20:34,483 --> 00:20:37,986
and I looked up and I saw a box and
it said, "take one."

506
00:20:37,986 --> 00:20:39,988
So I took one.

507
00:20:39,988 --> 00:20:42,991
There was nothing wrong with that.

508
00:20:42,991 --> 00:20:45,494
Oh, yes, there was.

509
00:20:45,494 --> 00:20:49,998
From then on, I took anything that
came into my pretty head

510
00:20:49,998 --> 00:20:53,001
even though it didn't say, "take
one."

511
00:20:53,001 --> 00:20:55,003
I took a bright, new penny.

512
00:20:55,003 --> 00:20:57,005
I took a bicycle.

513
00:20:57,005 --> 00:20:59,007
I took a little boy.

514
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:00,509
You took a little boy?

515
00:21:00,509 --> 00:21:02,010
Yeah.

516
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:05,013
But my mother made me give him back.

517
00:21:05,013 --> 00:21:08,016
And then...
then you grew up.

518
00:21:08,016 --> 00:21:10,018
Yeah.

519
00:21:10,018 --> 00:21:12,521
(adult's voice): Yeah.

520
00:21:12,521 --> 00:21:14,523
Yeah.

521
00:21:14,523 --> 00:21:17,526
Yeah, and I began picking pockets.

522
00:21:17,526 --> 00:21:20,028
I picked a peck of pockets.

523
00:21:20,028 --> 00:21:23,031
Pretty soon I graduated to purse
snatching.

524
00:21:23,031 --> 00:21:25,534
Would you like to see my collection?

525
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:28,036
Well, uh... I don't believe I have
time.

526
00:21:28,036 --> 00:21:29,538
Where's my watch?

527
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:31,039
Right here, sonny.

528
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:34,042
Come on, dead end.

529
00:21:34,042 --> 00:21:35,544
Okay, brains.

530
00:21:35,544 --> 00:21:39,548
Oh, Ricky, this is much more serious
than I realized.

531
00:21:39,548 --> 00:21:41,049
Oh, do you think there's any hope?

532
00:21:41,049 --> 00:21:42,050
Do you think you can do something?

533
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:43,051
I don't know.

534
00:21:43,051 --> 00:21:45,053
Hey! That's a lot of purses!

535
00:21:45,053 --> 00:21:46,054
I got purses here

536
00:21:46,054 --> 00:21:49,057
I ain't never opened yet.

537
00:21:49,057 --> 00:21:51,059
Get a load of this loot, sonny.

538
00:21:51,059 --> 00:21:53,061
Get a load of that, will you?

539
00:21:53,061 --> 00:21:55,063
Boy, I been snatching purses

540
00:21:55,063 --> 00:21:56,565
for nigh unto 12 years.

541
00:21:56,565 --> 00:21:58,066
Whoa, boy!

542
00:21:58,066 --> 00:22:01,069
I grabbed this one quicker than I
thought.

543
00:22:03,572 --> 00:22:04,573
I remember now--

544
00:22:04,573 --> 00:22:07,576
snatched this off a dummy in a store
window.

545
00:22:07,576 --> 00:22:08,577
Mrs. Ricardo.

546
00:22:08,577 --> 00:22:09,578
Yeah?

547
00:22:09,578 --> 00:22:12,581
I'm not just a friend of your
husband's.

548
00:22:12,581 --> 00:22:13,582
No?

549
00:22:13,582 --> 00:22:15,584
No, I'm a doctor, a psychiatrist.

550
00:22:16,084 --> 00:22:18,587
Now, if you'll undergo treatment with
me

551
00:22:18,587 --> 00:22:20,589
I think I can cure you of all this.

552
00:22:20,589 --> 00:22:23,091
Well... I think I'm cured completely.

553
00:22:23,091 --> 00:22:25,594
I don't think I'll ever steal
anything

554
00:22:25,594 --> 00:22:26,595
as long as I live.

555
00:22:26,595 --> 00:22:28,096
Oh, why?

556
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:29,598
Well, what is there left?

557
00:22:29,598 --> 00:22:32,100
This morning I achieved my highest
desire--

558
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:33,602
a kleptomaniac's dream.

559
00:22:33,602 --> 00:22:35,604
What do you mean, Mrs. Ricardo?

560
00:22:35,604 --> 00:22:39,107
Well, I...
sandpapered my fingertips

561
00:22:39,107 --> 00:22:43,612
put on my big coat with the big,
secret pocket

562
00:22:43,612 --> 00:22:46,615
went down to Clyde Beatty's circus.

563
00:22:47,115 --> 00:22:49,618
Down to Clyde Beatty's circus...

564
00:22:49,618 --> 00:22:53,121
What could she possibly get at the
Clyde Beatty circus?

565
00:22:54,122 --> 00:22:56,124
RICKY: Oh!

566
00:23:09,421 --> 00:23:12,307
(theme music playing)

567
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:27,322
The part of the doctor was played by
Joseph Kearns.

ETHEL: Hi, Lucy, here's the tray you
wanted.

00:00:34,334 --> 00:00:35,635
Oh, thanks, doll.

00:00:36,936 --> 00:00:39,539
Oh, look at the hors d'oeuvres.

Boy, are you fancy.

00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:41,708
Now, stop that.

6
00:00:42,141 --> 00:00:43,876
I've got them arranged just right.

7
00:00:43,876 --> 00:00:44,744
Who's coming?

8
00:00:44,744 --> 00:00:47,347
Some of Ricky's friends from Cuba.

00:00:49,082 --> 00:00:50,383
Yeah... Stop it!

11
00:00:50,383 --> 00:00:51,250
Gee, you know, Ethel,

12
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:52,985
we've been married all these years,

13
00:00:52,985 --> 00:00:53,853
and this is the first time

14
00:00:53,853 --> 00:00:56,022
any of Ricky's friends have ever
visited us.

15
00:00:56,022 --> 00:00:56,889
Hmm...

16
00:00:58,191 --> 00:01:00,360
And you know they're all going to go
back

17
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:03,830
and tell everybody what kind of a
girl Ricky married.

18
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:05,565
My entire Cuban reputation

19
00:01:05,565 --> 00:01:08,167
depends on how I handle myself this
afternoon.

20
00:01:08,167 --> 00:01:09,902
Oh, you'll do fine.

21
00:01:12,071 --> 00:01:13,373
Who are these people?

22
00:01:13,373 --> 00:01:15,108
Well, they're members of a dance
group

23
00:01:15,108 --> 00:01:16,843
that Ricky worked with in Cuba,

24
00:01:16,843 --> 00:01:18,578
and he's booked them into the club

25
00:01:18,578 --> 00:01:20,747
to start off their American tour.

26
00:01:20,747 --> 00:01:22,048
Gee, that's exciting.

27
00:01:22,048 --> 00:01:23,783
How do you like my new dress?

28
00:01:23,783 --> 00:01:25,952
Dreamy-- they'll go back to Cuba and
say...

29
00:01:25,952 --> 00:01:27,253
Oh, here they come, honey.

30
00:01:27,253 --> 00:01:29,422
Drop this in the kitchen on your way
out, will you?

31
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:31,157
Yeah. Good luck.

32
00:01:31,157 --> 00:01:32,024
Thank you.

33
00:01:33,326 --> 00:01:34,193
Lucy?

34
00:01:34,193 --> 00:01:35,061
Hello.

35
00:01:35,061 --> 00:01:36,362
Senor y Senora Ortega.

36
00:01:36,362 --> 00:01:37,663
How do you do?

37
00:01:37,663 --> 00:01:38,531
Carlos, Maria,

38
00:01:38,531 --> 00:01:40,266
How do you do?
this is Lucy.

39
00:01:40,266 --> 00:01:41,567
May I take your coat?

40
00:01:41,567 --> 00:01:42,001
Gracias.
Sientense.

41
00:01:42,001 --> 00:01:43,302
Sientense, a favor.

42
00:01:43,302 --> 00:01:44,604
Gracias.

43
00:01:45,905 --> 00:01:48,074
Lucy, did Fred bring the wine?

44
00:01:48,074 --> 00:01:48,941
Wine?

45
00:01:48,941 --> 00:01:51,110
Yeah, I told him to bring two special
bottles of wine.

46
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:52,412
Honey, I haven't seen it.

47
00:01:52,412 --> 00:01:53,713
Oh, I hope he didn't forget.

48
00:01:53,713 --> 00:01:55,882
I'll be right back.

49
00:01:55,882 --> 00:01:57,617
Well, it certainly is nice

50
00:01:57,617 --> 00:02:01,954
to meet some of Ricky's friends from
Cuba after all these years.

51
00:02:04,123 --> 00:02:05,858
I'll bet you wondered what I look
like.

52
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:13,666
Uh, what kind of a girl did you think
Ricky would marry?

53
00:02:15,401 --> 00:02:18,004
Don't tell me, I shouldn't have asked
that.

54
00:02:18,004 --> 00:02:20,606
How do you like the apartment?

55
00:02:20,606 --> 00:02:22,341
I decorated it myself.

56
00:02:22,341 --> 00:02:26,245
I think it has sort of a homey
atmosphere

57
00:02:26,245 --> 00:02:27,980
don't you think so?

58
00:02:34,053 --> 00:02:36,222
Would you have an hors d'oeuvre?

59
00:02:37,523 --> 00:02:39,258
I made them myself.

60
00:02:39,258 --> 00:02:40,993
Oh, gracias.

61
00:02:40,993 --> 00:02:42,295
Muchas gracias.

62
00:02:43,596 --> 00:02:44,897
Mm...

63
00:02:45,765 --> 00:02:47,934
Uh, Ricky told me all about your
dancing group

64
00:02:47,934 --> 00:02:50,102
and what a success it was in Cuba.

65
00:02:50,102 --> 00:02:51,404
Where do you think

66
00:02:51,404 --> 00:02:53,139
you'll go from here?

67
00:02:56,175 --> 00:02:59,212
Do you know where you'll go from
here?

68
00:03:06,152 --> 00:03:08,754
We donut.

69
00:03:10,056 --> 00:03:11,357
We donut?

70
00:03:11,357 --> 00:03:14,393
Sounds like someplace in Arkansas.

71
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:19,599
Oh...

72
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:23,936
"We donut speak English."

73
00:03:25,238 --> 00:03:26,539
Oh...

74
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:28,708
Oh, you don't speak English.

75
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:30,443
Oh, well...

76
00:03:33,045 --> 00:03:34,347
Well...

77
00:03:35,648 --> 00:03:36,949
Uh...

78
00:03:36,949 --> 00:03:39,118
will you have another hors d'oeuvre?

79
00:03:39,118 --> 00:03:40,419
Si, gracias.

80
00:03:40,419 --> 00:03:41,287
No, gracias.

81
00:03:43,456 --> 00:03:44,757
Uh, would you like a drink?

82
00:03:44,757 --> 00:03:46,058
Como?

83
00:03:46,058 --> 00:03:46,926
Oh, I forgot.

84
00:03:46,926 --> 00:03:49,529
(loudly): Would you like-o el
drink-o?

85
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:52,131
El drink-o.

86
00:03:53,432 --> 00:03:56,035
I'm sorry I took so long, honey.

87
00:03:56,035 --> 00:03:57,770
Did you have a nice talk?

88
00:03:57,770 --> 00:04:00,373
Well, I had a nice talk.

89
00:04:00,373 --> 00:04:02,108
Oh... I forgot to tell you--

90
00:04:02,542 --> 00:04:05,144
Carlos and Maria don't speak any
English.

91
00:04:05,144 --> 00:04:06,445
Yes.

92
00:04:06,445 --> 00:04:09,482
I sensed that while you were gone.

93
00:04:09,482 --> 00:04:10,783
Well, I'm back now.

94
00:04:10,783 --> 00:04:13,386
Estamos encantados de conocer a tu
mujer.

95
00:04:13,386 --> 00:04:14,687
Si, chico.

96
00:04:14,687 --> 00:04:16,856
Muchas gracias, muchas gracias.

97
00:04:16,856 --> 00:04:18,591
They want me to tell you

98
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:20,760
that they're very happy to meet you.

99
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,495
Oh, thank you.

100
00:04:22,495 --> 00:04:23,796
(loudly): Thank you.

101
00:04:25,531 --> 00:04:27,266
?Un poquito de vino, Maria?

102
00:04:27,266 --> 00:04:28,568
Gracias.

103
00:04:28,568 --> 00:04:29,435
Lucy?

104
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:31,170
?Carlos, quiero un poquito de vino?

105
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:32,471
Si, muchas gracias.

106
00:04:32,905 --> 00:04:34,206
Bueno, a sus saludes.

107
00:04:34,206 --> 00:04:35,074
A la salud.

108
00:04:35,074 --> 00:04:36,375
A cubita bella.

109
00:04:36,375 --> 00:04:38,544
Uh... l'chaim.

110
00:04:45,484 --> 00:04:46,352
Que vino.

111
00:04:46,352 --> 00:04:48,087
Buen vino, ?eh?

112
00:04:48,087 --> 00:04:49,822
Muy bueno el vino.

113
00:04:49,822 --> 00:04:51,991
(loudly:)
Well, it certainly is nice

114
00:04:51,991 --> 00:04:55,895
to meet some of Ricky's friends from
Cuba after all these years.

115
00:04:57,897 --> 00:04:59,365
Lucy diga que esta muy contenta

116
00:04:59,365 --> 00:05:01,534
de conocer a los amigos mios de Cuba

117
00:05:01,534 --> 00:05:03,269
despues de tantos anos de casados.

118
00:05:03,269 --> 00:05:05,438
BOTH: Ah, muchas gracias.

119
00:05:07,607 --> 00:05:11,510
(loudly): Uh... did you have a nice
boat trip up here?

120
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:14,981
Honey, they're not hard of hearing,
you know.

121
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:16,282
Oh.

122
00:05:16,282 --> 00:05:18,017
Oh...

123
00:05:18,017 --> 00:05:19,318
Oh, did you have...

124
00:05:19,318 --> 00:05:22,355
Well, honey, you ask them if they had
a nice boat trip.

125
00:05:23,656 --> 00:05:26,692
Lucy wants to know if you had a-- oh,
fine.

126
00:05:32,331 --> 00:05:35,801
Mi senora que...

127
00:05:35,801 --> 00:05:39,271
Mi senora quiere saber si ustedes
tuvieron un buen viaje.

128
00:05:39,271 --> 00:05:41,440
Si se marearon.

129
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,175
Ah...

130
00:05:43,175 --> 00:05:47,513
El primer dia fue magnifico.

131
00:05:47,513 --> 00:05:49,682
RICKY: The first day out was just
beautiful.

132
00:05:49,682 --> 00:05:50,983
Oh, uh-huh.

133
00:05:50,983 --> 00:05:55,321
El segundo dia, el mar se puso un
poco brusco.

134
00:05:55,755 --> 00:05:57,056
RICKY: The second day

135
00:05:57,056 --> 00:05:58,791
the seas got a little rough.

136
00:05:58,791 --> 00:06:00,092
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

137
00:06:00,092 --> 00:06:01,827
El tercer dia

138
00:06:01,827 --> 00:06:05,731
las olas son grandes grandes grandes.

139
00:06:05,731 --> 00:06:10,503
Maria y yo estuvimos sumamente
mareados asi...

140
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:17,009
RICKY: The third day the waves...

141
00:06:17,009 --> 00:06:19,612
Never mind, never mind.

142
00:06:19,612 --> 00:06:22,214
I understand more Spanish than I
thought.

143
00:06:24,817 --> 00:06:26,986
Ricky, que buena suerte has tenido

144
00:06:26,986 --> 00:06:29,155
a encontrarte una esposa tan bonita.

145
00:06:29,155 --> 00:06:30,890
Gracias, amigo, gracias.

146
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:33,059
Es cierta. Es muy bonita iy que
cabello!

147
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:34,794
Yo nunca he visto ese color en Cuba.

148
00:06:35,227 --> 00:06:36,095
No, no, verdad.

149
00:06:36,095 --> 00:06:39,131
MARIA: ?Es su color natural?

150
00:06:39,131 --> 00:06:40,866
Uh... beg pardon?

151
00:06:43,035 --> 00:06:47,373
She wants to know if the color of
your hair is natural.

152
00:06:47,373 --> 00:06:49,975
Oh, well, certainly tell them it's
natural.

153
00:06:49,975 --> 00:06:52,578
My father and my mother both had red
hair.

154
00:06:57,349 --> 00:06:59,085
Well, Ricky, go ahead and tell them.

155
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:00,820
El color de pelo de ella

156
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:04,290
es lo mismo que el color del pelo en
Cuba, ?tu comprende?

157
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:07,326
Lo unico que ella se lo conserva de
esa manera

158
00:07:07,326 --> 00:07:09,061
con una henna rinse.

159
00:07:17,303 --> 00:07:20,773
I have an idea my hair suffered in
the translation.

160
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:22,942
?Vino?

161
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:24,243
No, gracias.

162
00:07:24,243 --> 00:07:25,111
?No? ?Vino?

163
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:26,412
Muchas gracias, si.

164
00:07:26,412 --> 00:07:28,581
Gracias.

165
00:07:28,581 --> 00:07:31,183
Oye, Renita llegara dentro de un
momento.

166
00:07:31,183 --> 00:07:32,485
Ah, ?si?

167
00:07:32,485 --> 00:07:33,786
He estado tratando averiguar

168
00:07:33,786 --> 00:07:35,955
a que hora llega el avion que tomo
Ramon.

169
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:37,690
Parece como una hora tardada.

170
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:38,557
A lo siento mucho.

171
00:07:38,557 --> 00:07:40,292
Se me ocurre una cosa.

172
00:07:40,292 --> 00:07:41,594
?Que cosa?

173
00:07:41,594 --> 00:07:44,196
Si Ramon no llega al tiempo para la
apertura

174
00:07:44,196 --> 00:07:46,365
?porque no bailes tu con Renita?

175
00:07:46,365 --> 00:07:47,666
?Yo bailar con Renita?

176
00:07:47,666 --> 00:07:48,534
Si.

177
00:07:48,534 --> 00:07:49,835
?Por que no?

178
00:07:49,835 --> 00:07:51,570
No, no, de verdad...

179
00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:52,872
?Por que no?

180
00:07:52,872 --> 00:07:53,739
Chico, isi!

181
00:07:53,739 --> 00:07:55,474
No, no, no, no...

182
00:07:55,474 --> 00:07:57,643
Oh, go ahead.

183
00:08:03,282 --> 00:08:05,017
Well, honey, I just...

184
00:08:05,017 --> 00:08:06,318
Go ahead and what?

185
00:08:06,318 --> 00:08:07,620
I don't know.

186
00:08:08,921 --> 00:08:09,789
I'm sorry.

187
00:08:09,789 --> 00:08:12,391
La senora no entiende lo que estaba
hablando.

188
00:08:12,391 --> 00:08:13,692
Perdona un momento.

189
00:08:13,692 --> 00:08:14,560
Honey, I'm sorry.

190
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,295
You don't know what we're talking
about.

191
00:08:16,295 --> 00:08:17,596
We're talking about Renita Perez.
Who?

192
00:08:17,596 --> 00:08:19,765
Renita Perez-- she'll be here any
minute.

193
00:08:19,765 --> 00:08:20,633
Oh.

194
00:08:20,633 --> 00:08:21,934
She's with the troupe, you know.

195
00:08:22,368 --> 00:08:24,537
And when I was in Cuba, I used to do
a number with her

196
00:08:24,537 --> 00:08:25,838
in which I played her father.

197
00:08:25,838 --> 00:08:27,573
Oh, really?

198
00:08:27,573 --> 00:08:30,176
She was the cutest little thing

199
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:31,477
you ever saw.
Aw...

200
00:08:31,477 --> 00:08:33,212
So, they were telling me, you know,

201
00:08:33,212 --> 00:08:35,381
that her partner hasn't arrived in
New York,

202
00:08:35,381 --> 00:08:36,682
and they want me to dance with her

203
00:08:36,682 --> 00:08:38,417
tomorrow night at the opening.

204
00:08:38,417 --> 00:08:41,020
Well, honey, I think you should.

205
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:42,321
Go ahead.

206
00:08:42,321 --> 00:08:43,189
Well...

207
00:08:43,622 --> 00:08:46,225
I'd love to see you and little Renita
dance.

208
00:08:46,225 --> 00:08:48,394
Well, honey, I haven't done that kind
of stuff in a long time.

209
00:08:48,394 --> 00:08:49,695
Oh, now, nonsense.

210
00:08:49,695 --> 00:08:52,298
Besides, it would help the good
neighbor policy.

211
00:08:52,298 --> 00:08:54,900
(loudly): The good neighbor policy
would be helped.

212
00:08:56,635 --> 00:08:58,370
All right, I'll do it.

213
00:08:58,370 --> 00:08:59,238
Okay. Yo lo hare.

214
00:08:59,238 --> 00:09:00,539
Ah, que bueno.

215
00:09:00,539 --> 00:09:01,841
Si viene Ramon, yo no bailo.

216
00:09:01,841 --> 00:09:03,142
(buzzer)

217
00:09:07,913 --> 00:09:09,215
Yes?

218
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:10,516
Good evening.

219
00:09:10,516 --> 00:09:11,817
Good evening.

220
00:09:11,817 --> 00:09:13,118
Ricky!

221
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:16,155
Oh, Renita!

222
00:09:18,324 --> 00:09:23,095
(speaking rapidly in Spanish)

223
00:09:23,095 --> 00:09:24,830
Oye, presentela a tu senora.

224
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:26,565
Oh, Renita, come here, honey.

225
00:09:26,565 --> 00:09:28,300
I want you to meet my wife.

226
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:29,602
Lucy, this is Renita.

227
00:09:29,602 --> 00:09:30,903
Renita, this is my wife Lucy.

228
00:09:30,903 --> 00:09:31,770
How do you do?

229
00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:33,072
How do you do?

230
00:09:33,072 --> 00:09:33,939
It is so exciting.

231
00:09:33,939 --> 00:09:35,674
I haven't seen Ricky

232
00:09:35,674 --> 00:09:37,409
since I was a little girl.

233
00:09:37,409 --> 00:09:39,144
Yeah, that's what he told me.

234
00:09:40,446 --> 00:09:43,916
And I can't get over how he's
developed.

235
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:45,651
Yeah.

236
00:09:46,952 --> 00:09:49,121
You've done pretty well yourself.

237
00:09:50,422 --> 00:09:51,290
Thank you.

238
00:09:51,724 --> 00:09:53,025
CARLOS: Oye, Renita.

239
00:09:53,025 --> 00:09:54,326
Estamos esperando aqui...

240
00:09:54,326 --> 00:09:56,929
Ricky, I think you're right, dear,

241
00:09:56,929 --> 00:09:58,664
about not doing that dance.

242
00:09:58,664 --> 00:10:00,833
Oh, no, honey, I think you are right.

243
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:02,568
I think I ought to do it.

244
00:10:02,568 --> 00:10:05,604
As you said, I think it would help
the good neighbor policy.

245
00:10:06,038 --> 00:10:08,207
Yeah, well, that policy just lapsed.

246
00:10:08,207 --> 00:10:09,074
Ricky, they just told me

247
00:10:09,074 --> 00:10:11,677
you're going to dance with me
tonight.

248
00:10:11,677 --> 00:10:12,544
Si.

249
00:10:12,544 --> 00:10:13,846
Won't that be fun?

250
00:10:13,846 --> 00:10:16,015
Oh!

251
00:10:16,015 --> 00:10:19,051
(Ricky hums)

252
00:10:25,991 --> 00:10:27,293
Hi, Lucy.

253
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:29,028
We came up to collect the rent.

254
00:10:29,028 --> 00:10:31,196
Okay, girl, here it is.

255
00:10:31,196 --> 00:10:32,498
Thanks.

256
00:10:32,498 --> 00:10:33,365
Okay, let's go.

257
00:10:33,365 --> 00:10:34,233
Relax, speedy.

258
00:10:34,233 --> 00:10:35,968
Come on, we got two more apartments
to make.

259
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:37,703
Now, let's go.
Wait just a minute.

260
00:10:37,703 --> 00:10:39,438
How did your meeting with Ricky's
friends go?

261
00:10:39,438 --> 00:10:41,173
We've got two more apartments to
make.

262
00:10:41,173 --> 00:10:42,041
I said let's go.

263
00:10:42,474 --> 00:10:44,643
Oh, now, Fred, I'm sorry you're in
such a hurry.

264
00:10:44,643 --> 00:10:46,378
I kinda wanted to ask your advice

265
00:10:46,378 --> 00:10:48,547
about a sexy Cuban girl that was here
last night.

266
00:10:48,547 --> 00:10:49,848
Come on.

267
00:10:49,848 --> 00:10:51,150
Sexy Cuban gal?

268
00:10:52,885 --> 00:10:55,054
What about the sexy Cuban gal?

269
00:10:55,054 --> 00:10:58,958
Push your eyes back in your head,
fatso.

270
00:10:59,825 --> 00:11:01,560
Come on, tell me, what happened?

271
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:04,163
Well, it seems that when this girl,
Renita, was a child

272
00:11:04,596 --> 00:11:06,765
she and Ricky used to dance together.

273
00:11:06,765 --> 00:11:08,934
She was much younger than he was.

274
00:11:08,934 --> 00:11:10,235
Yeah, what happened?

275
00:11:10,235 --> 00:11:12,404
Well somehow she caught up with him.

276
00:11:13,706 --> 00:11:14,573
So?

277
00:11:14,573 --> 00:11:16,308
So now her partner hasn't arrived

278
00:11:16,308 --> 00:11:18,477
and they want Ricky to dance with her
tonight.

279
00:11:18,477 --> 00:11:19,345
So?

280
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:21,513
So... so...

281
00:11:21,513 --> 00:11:23,248
you haven't seen Renita.

282
00:11:23,248 --> 00:11:24,984
I'd just like to get a load

283
00:11:24,984 --> 00:11:26,719
of that dance they're doing, that's
all.

284
00:11:26,719 --> 00:11:28,020
Then why don't you go to rehearsal.

285
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:28,887
Oh, I can't do that.

286
00:11:28,887 --> 00:11:31,056
I'm not going down there and have
Ricky think

287
00:11:31,056 --> 00:11:32,791
that I'm jealous and spying on him.

288
00:11:32,791 --> 00:11:35,828
Well, I could go watch and then
report to you.

289
00:11:35,828 --> 00:11:37,997
Oh, no you couldn't.

290
00:11:37,997 --> 00:11:39,298
I could go.

291
00:11:39,298 --> 00:11:41,033
No, that's no good.

292
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:42,768
Well, you know in the afternoon down
at that club,

293
00:11:42,768 --> 00:11:45,371
there's always a couple of those
scrubwomen hanging around.

294
00:11:46,672 --> 00:11:47,973
Scrubwomen?

295
00:11:47,973 --> 00:11:48,841
Scrubwomen.

296
00:11:59,685 --> 00:12:00,986
All right, hold it, hold it, hold it.

297
00:12:00,986 --> 00:12:02,721
Listen, in that part of the brass,

298
00:12:02,721 --> 00:12:04,456
let's bite them off a little more.

299
00:12:04,456 --> 00:12:07,059
Let's go: Dah di da da da

300
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:08,360
Ta ta da da

301
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,228
All right?

302
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:10,529
Now, let's hear it.

303
00:12:10,529 --> 00:12:11,397
Just the brass.

304
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:12,698
Give you two.

305
00:12:12,698 --> 00:12:13,565
A-one, a-two.

306
00:12:13,565 --> 00:12:16,168
Dah di da da da

307
00:12:16,168 --> 00:12:17,903
Ta ta da da.

308
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:25,711
Everybody's a comic.

309
00:12:25,711 --> 00:12:27,446
All right, come on, you know what I
mean.

310
00:12:27,446 --> 00:12:28,747
From the top, eh?

311
00:12:28,747 --> 00:12:30,049
Right from the top now.

312
00:12:30,049 --> 00:12:31,350
All right, here we go.

313
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:37,856
(playing latin rumba)

314
00:12:37,856 --> 00:12:40,459
Say, have you ever met the girl

315
00:12:40,893 --> 00:12:43,495
Who's the toast of the town

316
00:12:43,495 --> 00:12:46,098
A work of art without a question

317
00:12:46,098 --> 00:12:49,568
Who gives your heart a queer
congestion

318
00:12:49,568 --> 00:12:55,641
Say, have you ever seen the dream in
the red velvet gown?

319
00:12:55,641 --> 00:12:58,243
If you will pardon my suggestion

320
00:12:58,243 --> 00:13:00,412
You better write her number down.

321
00:13:00,412 --> 00:13:02,147
(band stops)

322
00:13:02,147 --> 00:13:03,882
She's a doll isn't she?

323
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:08,220
(band resumes)

324
00:13:13,425 --> 00:13:15,594
Oh the lady in red

325
00:13:15,594 --> 00:13:18,630
The fellows are crazy for the lady in
red

326
00:13:19,932 --> 00:13:23,836
She's a bit gaudy but lordy what a
personality

327
00:13:25,571 --> 00:13:26,872
I'm the lady in red

328
00:13:27,306 --> 00:13:29,908
As fresh as a daisy when this town is
in bed

329
00:13:32,077 --> 00:13:37,282
Dancing and dining and shining with
originality.

330
00:13:37,282 --> 00:13:39,017
She's very proper

331
00:13:39,017 --> 00:13:42,054
She's nothing more than a pal

332
00:13:42,054 --> 00:13:43,789
Oh, me and oh, my

333
00:13:43,789 --> 00:13:47,259
You'll never stop her, she's a
dangerous gal

334
00:13:47,259 --> 00:13:49,428
If I ever met the right guy.

335
00:13:49,428 --> 00:13:51,163
Oh, the lady in red

336
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:54,199
The fellows are crazy for the lady in
red

337
00:13:55,934 --> 00:14:01,140
She's a bit gaudy but lordy what a
personality.

338
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:37,576
Hey! Hey! Hey!

339
00:14:53,625 --> 00:14:55,360
(number ends)

340
00:14:57,095 --> 00:14:59,264
What's the matter with them?

341
00:14:59,698 --> 00:15:00,566
I don't know what's the matter with
them.

342
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:03,602
That's the way that the rumba affects
people,

343
00:15:03,602 --> 00:15:04,903
even at their age.

344
00:15:04,903 --> 00:15:05,771
Muy bien hecho, Ricardo.

345
00:15:05,771 --> 00:15:07,072
Gracias.

346
00:15:07,072 --> 00:15:09,241
iRenita, aqui esta un telegrama para
ti!

347
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:10,542
Ojala que sea de Ramon.
Yeah.

348
00:15:10,542 --> 00:15:12,711
Oh, it is, it's from Ramon.
He's in New York.

349
00:15:12,711 --> 00:15:14,446
He's going to be here this afternoon.

350
00:15:14,446 --> 00:15:16,615
Oh, good, now you can do the number
with him.

351
00:15:16,615 --> 00:15:17,916
Oh, no, Ricky.

352
00:15:17,916 --> 00:15:18,784
Oh, yes, honey.

353
00:15:19,218 --> 00:15:20,519
I'm not as good a shape as I used to
be.

354
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:21,820
Besides, I'd like to see you do

355
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:23,555
that native wedding dance you told me
about, huh?

356
00:15:23,555 --> 00:15:25,724
All right, I'll get the music.

357
00:15:25,724 --> 00:15:27,025
It's in my dressing room.

358
00:15:27,025 --> 00:15:28,327
Honey, I'll get it.

359
00:15:28,327 --> 00:15:30,062
(breathlessly): You get it.

360
00:15:30,062 --> 00:15:32,231
(laughing)

361
00:15:32,231 --> 00:15:36,134
No cracks from you characters.

362
00:15:43,942 --> 00:15:46,979
Uh, would you care for some cookies,
Renita, dear?

363
00:15:46,979 --> 00:15:48,280
No, gracias.

364
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:50,015
It's been lovely visiting with you,
though, Lucy,

365
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:51,750
and I must really hurry down to the
club.

366
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:53,919
I have to get ready for the opening,
you know.

367
00:15:53,919 --> 00:15:56,521
Oh. Well, Renita, it's been just
wonderful getting to know you.

368
00:15:56,521 --> 00:15:58,257
Lucy... oh, I'm sorry.

369
00:15:58,257 --> 00:15:59,992
I didn't know you had company.

370
00:15:59,992 --> 00:16:01,293
That's all right, Ethel.

371
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:03,028
Renita, this is Ethel Mertz.

372
00:16:03,028 --> 00:16:03,895
How do you do?
How do you do?

373
00:16:04,329 --> 00:16:06,498
Well, you don't mind if I go freshen
up a bit, do you?

374
00:16:06,498 --> 00:16:06,932
Oh, no, not a bit.

375
00:16:06,932 --> 00:16:08,233
Right in through there, dear.

376
00:16:08,233 --> 00:16:09,534
Right in through the bedroom.

377
00:16:09,534 --> 00:16:10,402
Thank you.
Yes.

378
00:16:10,402 --> 00:16:13,438
Oh, isn't she cute.

379
00:16:13,438 --> 00:16:14,740
Lucy, I don't trust you

380
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:16,475
being so palsy- walsy with her.

381
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:18,210
What are you planning to do?

382
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:19,945
Oh, you're so smart.

383
00:16:19,945 --> 00:16:22,547
Listen, I'm going to do that "Lady In
Red" number

384
00:16:22,547 --> 00:16:25,150
with Ricky tonight if it's the last
thing I do.

385
00:16:25,584 --> 00:16:27,319
Wait till you see the beautiful
costume I have.

386
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:28,620
Oh, now, Lucy, this is just silly.

387
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:30,355
Why don't you let her do the dance
with him.

388
00:16:30,355 --> 00:16:32,090
You don't even know the steps.

389
00:16:32,090 --> 00:16:33,392
Listen, a rumba's a rumba.

390
00:16:33,392 --> 00:16:35,127
You just wiggle your hips

391
00:16:35,127 --> 00:16:36,428
and jump up and down.

392
00:16:36,428 --> 00:16:39,031
What about her?

393
00:16:39,031 --> 00:16:40,766
I have plans.

394
00:16:40,766 --> 00:16:42,067
Good-bye, Lucy.

395
00:16:42,067 --> 00:16:43,368
Oh, darling, I'll call you a cab.

396
00:16:43,368 --> 00:16:44,236
Pardon me, Ethel.

397
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:45,971
No, no, that's all right.
I will take the subway.

398
00:16:45,971 --> 00:16:47,272
No, no, no, I wouldn't hear of it.

399
00:16:47,272 --> 00:16:48,140
Nonsense. Now sit down.

400
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:49,007
I'll call a cab.

401
00:16:51,176 --> 00:16:52,477
?Como esta?

402
00:16:52,477 --> 00:16:53,345
Oh!

403
00:16:53,345 --> 00:16:55,080
iUsted tambien habla espanol!

404
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,815
Lucy no me dijo que ella habla
espanol

405
00:16:56,815 --> 00:16:58,550
porque toda la gente hablaba espanol

406
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:00,285
y ella no estaba diciendo nada.

407
00:17:01,586 --> 00:17:03,755
Oui.

408
00:17:05,057 --> 00:17:07,659
Hello. Hello, I'd like you to send a
cab

409
00:17:07,659 --> 00:17:09,394
to 623 East 68th Street.

410
00:17:09,394 --> 00:17:10,696
Right away, please.

411
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:12,864
Apartment 4A.
Yes, thank you.

412
00:17:12,864 --> 00:17:14,166
The cab will be right over.

413
00:17:14,166 --> 00:17:15,467
RENITA: Thank you.

414
00:17:15,467 --> 00:17:17,202
(buzzer)

415
00:17:21,973 --> 00:17:24,576
Did you call a cab, lady?

416
00:17:26,311 --> 00:17:27,612
Well, yes, I did.

417
00:17:27,612 --> 00:17:29,348
I'd have been here sooner

418
00:17:29,348 --> 00:17:31,783
only, but, uh, traffic was agin' me.

419
00:17:31,783 --> 00:17:32,818
Good-bye, Mrs. Mertz.

420
00:17:32,818 --> 00:17:34,119
Now, Cabbie, I want you to take

421
00:17:34,119 --> 00:17:35,854
very good care of this little lady.

422
00:17:35,854 --> 00:17:37,589
I want you to take her to the
Tropicana Club.

423
00:17:37,589 --> 00:17:38,890
Don't you worry, lady.

424
00:17:38,890 --> 00:17:41,493
I know a short cut through
Piladelpia.

425
00:17:42,794 --> 00:17:44,096
Adios, Lucy.

426
00:17:44,096 --> 00:17:44,963
Adios.

427
00:17:44,963 --> 00:17:46,264
Good-bye, lady.

428
00:17:46,264 --> 00:17:47,566
Adios.

429
00:17:50,168 --> 00:17:51,903
Lucy...

430
00:17:59,711 --> 00:18:01,446
Bueno, muy bueno.

431
00:18:01,446 --> 00:18:03,615
Magnifico, isn't that right?

432
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:06,651
Thank you.

433
00:18:06,651 --> 00:18:08,820
Thank you very much, Carlos and
Maria,

434
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:11,423
and thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

435
00:18:11,423 --> 00:18:14,025
I'm indeed very happy that you like
those wonderful people

436
00:18:14,025 --> 00:18:15,761
because they were the ones

437
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:18,363
that gave me my start in show
business.

438
00:18:18,363 --> 00:18:21,400
And now for the highlight of the
evening,

439
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:25,303
I'd like to introduce to you Ramon
and Renita

440
00:18:25,303 --> 00:18:29,641
doing their version of the African
wedding dance.

441
00:18:29,641 --> 00:18:33,545
So now we take you to...

442
00:18:33,545 --> 00:18:35,714
(drum roll)

443
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:38,750
Africa.

444
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:40,919
(horns blast)

445
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:43,088
Just me.

446
00:18:44,389 --> 00:18:46,558
I only want to get you into the mood.

447
00:18:46,558 --> 00:18:51,329
You know, on the night of the full
Moon,

448
00:18:51,329 --> 00:18:55,233
the high priest goes to a jungle
clearing

449
00:18:55,233 --> 00:18:57,836
and sings a song of love

450
00:18:57,836 --> 00:19:00,872
and then follows the courtship dance

451
00:19:00,872 --> 00:19:05,644
in which the bridegroom tries to
impress his bride-to-be

452
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:08,680
with his fierceness and strength.

453
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:13,452
So now let's pretend that this is a
jungle clearing,

454
00:19:13,452 --> 00:19:15,620
there is a full Moon,

455
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:19,524
and the high priest is singing his
song.

456
00:19:22,561 --> 00:19:24,729
(harp plays)

457
00:19:46,418 --> 00:19:51,623
Spirit in the wood, beat the hollow
cane

458
00:19:51,623 --> 00:19:55,961
Spirit in the wood, float away the
pain

459
00:19:55,961 --> 00:20:01,166
Make their bodies ripe and alive
again

460
00:20:01,166 --> 00:20:03,335
I sing me-lo

461
00:20:03,335 --> 00:20:05,504
I sing me-lo

462
00:20:05,504 --> 00:20:07,239
I sing me-lo

463
00:20:07,239 --> 00:20:11,576
Spirit in the heart, make the blood
flow fast

464
00:20:11,576 --> 00:20:16,348
Spirit in the heart, make the muscle
last

465
00:20:16,348 --> 00:20:21,553
Keep the hope alive while their youth
will pass

466
00:20:21,553 --> 00:20:23,288
I sing me-lo

467
00:20:23,288 --> 00:20:25,891
I sing me-lo

468
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:27,192
I sing me-lo

469
00:20:27,192 --> 00:20:31,963
When the woman come upon the scene

470
00:20:31,963 --> 00:20:36,301
Drop a petal from a tree

471
00:20:36,301 --> 00:20:41,072
Veil the mountain up into the skies

472
00:20:41,072 --> 00:20:44,109
Spill the river in the sea.

473
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:47,579
Spirit in the wood

474
00:20:47,579 --> 00:20:54,085
Let the hollow cane echo in the
afterglow

475
00:20:54,085 --> 00:20:59,724
Waiting for the flame to burn again

476
00:20:59,724 --> 00:21:01,459
I sing me-lo

477
00:21:01,893 --> 00:21:03,628
I sing me-lo

478
00:21:03,628 --> 00:21:05,797
I sing me-lo

479
00:21:11,002 --> 00:21:13,171
I sing me-lo

480
00:21:20,111 --> 00:21:22,714
I sing me-lo

481
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:33,992
I...

482
00:21:37,896 --> 00:21:40,065
Sing me-lo.

483
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:49,174
(applause)

484
00:21:49,174 --> 00:21:52,210
(drum roll)

485
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:55,246
(brass plays)

486
00:21:55,680 --> 00:22:02,187
(band plays introduction)

487
00:22:09,561 --> 00:22:13,898
(band plays, not rumba music)

488
00:22:21,706 --> 00:22:23,008
(screams)

489
00:22:26,044 --> 00:22:26,911
(screams)

490
00:22:37,756 --> 00:22:39,057
(screams)

491
00:22:42,961 --> 00:22:44,262
(screams)

492
00:23:03,348 --> 00:23:05,950
(no sound)

493
00:23:26,337 --> 00:23:28,940
(screams)

494
00:23:30,675 --> 00:23:35,013

Convy.


1
00:00:38,904 --> 00:00:40,639
Here you are, dear.

2
00:00:40,639 --> 00:00:42,374
Oh, thank you, honey.

3
00:00:43,675 --> 00:00:44,977
Hey, what goes here?

4
00:00:44,977 --> 00:00:47,579
Just two eggs?
Where's the bacon?

5
00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:50,182
Bacon happens to be 75 cents a pound.

6
00:00:50,182 --> 00:00:53,218
Look, Lucy, I can't eat eggs that
way.

7
00:00:53,652 --> 00:00:55,821
They-they-they look absolutely naked.

8
00:00:55,821 --> 00:00:58,423
Well, look the other way when you eat
them.

9
00:00:58,423 --> 00:01:00,592
Now, Lucy, where's the bacon?

10
00:01:00,592 --> 00:01:03,629
As far as I'm concerned, it's still
on the hog.

11
00:01:03,629 --> 00:01:06,665
I'm economizing.

12
00:01:06,665 --> 00:01:08,400
Well, look, honey, that's a very good
attitude,

13
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,003
but why do you have to cut down on
food?

14
00:01:11,003 --> 00:01:13,171
There's just no other place to cut
down.

15
00:01:13,605 --> 00:01:14,473
Is that so, eh?

16
00:01:14,473 --> 00:01:17,075
What about all the money that you
spend on clothes

17
00:01:17,075 --> 00:01:18,810
and the beauty parlor, hmm?

18
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:20,545
Why don't you cut them out?

19
00:01:20,545 --> 00:01:22,714
Well, all right, if you think you'd
like your meals served

20
00:01:22,714 --> 00:01:25,317
by an ugly brunette wearing a flour
sack.

21
00:01:27,486 --> 00:01:28,787
You know what I mean.

22
00:01:28,787 --> 00:01:31,390
This must be some other way to
economize.

23
00:01:31,390 --> 00:01:33,992
Well, as a matter of fact there is,
Ricky.

24
00:01:33,992 --> 00:01:36,595
Look, "Save money with a home
freezer.

25
00:01:36,595 --> 00:01:38,330
Get your meat wholesale."

26
00:01:38,330 --> 00:01:40,499
I knew it! I knew it had to be
something

27
00:01:40,932 --> 00:01:42,234
in back of all this.

28
00:01:42,234 --> 00:01:43,969
But it won't cost us a cent, Ricky.

29
00:01:43,969 --> 00:01:45,270
Look, it says right here:

30
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:46,571
"This freezer pays for itself."

31
00:01:46,571 --> 00:01:47,873
Oh, well, let me see.

32
00:01:47,873 --> 00:01:49,174
Hey, maybe we ought to get one.

33
00:01:49,174 --> 00:01:50,475
Really?

34
00:01:50,475 --> 00:01:51,777
Sure.

35
00:01:51,777 --> 00:01:53,945
As soon as it gets through paying for
itself,

36
00:01:53,945 --> 00:01:55,681
tell it to give us a call and come
over.

37
00:01:57,416 --> 00:01:59,151
Now, you know what I meant.

38
00:01:59,151 --> 00:02:01,319
Honey, I can't afford a freezer,

39
00:02:01,319 --> 00:02:03,488
not even one that pays for itself.

40
00:02:03,488 --> 00:02:05,657
But Ricky, listen, it's only going to
save us money...

41
00:02:05,657 --> 00:02:07,826
I cannot do it, honey, no.

42
00:02:07,826 --> 00:02:09,127
Can't afford it.

43
00:02:09,127 --> 00:02:10,429
See you later.

44
00:02:10,429 --> 00:02:12,164
What about your eggs?

45
00:02:12,164 --> 00:02:13,465
Oh, I got a feeling

46
00:02:13,465 --> 00:02:15,634
that they won't go to waste.

47
00:02:15,634 --> 00:02:17,803
Ethel is coming up, isn't she?

48
00:02:17,803 --> 00:02:19,538
Good-bye.

49
00:02:19,538 --> 00:02:20,839
Good-bye.

50
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:26,912
Good morning, Lucy.

51
00:02:26,912 --> 00:02:27,779
Oh, yeah?

52
00:02:28,213 --> 00:02:29,081
Good-bye, Lucy.

53
00:02:29,081 --> 00:02:30,382
Come back, Ethel.

54
00:02:30,382 --> 00:02:32,984
If I'd wanted to be with somebody
grumpy

55
00:02:32,984 --> 00:02:34,720
I'd have stayed downstairs with Fred.

56
00:02:43,829 --> 00:02:45,564
What's the matter with you?

57
00:02:45,564 --> 00:02:46,431
Oh, I asked Ricky

58
00:02:46,431 --> 00:02:48,600
if we couldn't have this freezer,

59
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,335
and he says he can't afford it.

60
00:02:50,335 --> 00:02:51,203
Can't afford it.

61
00:02:51,203 --> 00:02:53,805
I asked Fred to buy us a freezer,
too.

62
00:02:53,805 --> 00:02:55,107
What did he say?

63
00:02:55,107 --> 00:02:56,842
I'll tell you what I said.

64
00:02:56,842 --> 00:02:59,444
Please, please, there are ladies
present.

65
00:02:59,444 --> 00:03:02,481
I just come up to tell you not to
expect any heat today.

66
00:03:02,481 --> 00:03:04,649
I put all new firebrick in that
furnace

67
00:03:04,649 --> 00:03:07,252
and we can't use it till the cement
dries.

68
00:03:07,252 --> 00:03:09,855
This house might be a home freezer
itself by night.

69
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:15,060
Charm boy.

70
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:16,361
Yeah.

71
00:03:17,662 --> 00:03:21,133
Gee, why is it everything that's
wonderful costs money?

72
00:03:21,133 --> 00:03:22,868
I don't know.

73
00:03:22,868 --> 00:03:25,470
Say, why didn't I think of this
before?

74
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:27,205
Uncle Oscar!

75
00:03:27,205 --> 00:03:28,073
Uncle Oscar?

76
00:03:28,073 --> 00:03:29,808
My Uncle Oscar is a butcher,

77
00:03:29,808 --> 00:03:31,543
and he's got a big cold chest.

78
00:03:31,977 --> 00:03:35,013
Why don't you knit him a sweater?

79
00:03:36,314 --> 00:03:39,351
Well, of course, if you don't want to
hear my plan...

80
00:03:39,351 --> 00:03:41,086
I do, I do.

81
00:03:41,086 --> 00:03:42,821
Well, he's retiring from the meat
business,

82
00:03:42,821 --> 00:03:44,556
and he's got a great big old
freezer--

83
00:03:44,556 --> 00:03:47,159
you know, the kind you walk into and
hang up the meat.

84
00:03:47,159 --> 00:03:49,327
I'll bet he'd sell us that for
practically nothing.

85
00:03:49,327 --> 00:03:51,930
Really?
I'm going to call him up.

86
00:03:54,533 --> 00:03:56,701
If we could buy it and put it in the
basement,

87
00:03:56,701 --> 00:03:58,870
we'd have a real home freezer.

88
00:03:58,870 --> 00:04:00,605
How much do you think he'd sell it
for?

89
00:04:00,605 --> 00:04:02,774
I don't know, but there's no harm in
asking him,

90
00:04:02,774 --> 00:04:04,509
'cause this would be a great way...

91
00:04:04,509 --> 00:04:05,377
Hello, Uncle Oscar?

92
00:04:05,377 --> 00:04:06,678
This is little Ethel.

93
00:04:07,112 --> 00:04:08,413
Little?

94
00:04:09,714 --> 00:04:11,883
Uncle Oscar, how much do you want

95
00:04:11,883 --> 00:04:14,052
for that big old freezer of yours?

96
00:04:14,052 --> 00:04:15,353
For me.

97
00:04:15,353 --> 00:04:17,088
Well, that sounds like a fair price.

98
00:04:17,088 --> 00:04:18,390
How much?

99
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:20,559
He'll sell it to us for nothing.

100
00:04:20,559 --> 00:04:22,294
For nothing!

101
00:04:22,294 --> 00:04:24,029
All we have to do is pay

102
00:04:24,029 --> 00:04:25,764
for the hauling and installation?

103
00:04:25,764 --> 00:04:27,065
How much is that?

104
00:04:27,065 --> 00:04:28,366
How much is that?

105
00:04:28,366 --> 00:04:29,668
$50.

106
00:04:29,668 --> 00:04:30,535
Sold!

107
00:04:30,535 --> 00:04:31,837
We'll take it!

108
00:04:31,837 --> 00:04:33,572
When can we have it installed?

109
00:04:33,572 --> 00:04:34,873
This afternoon?

110
00:04:34,873 --> 00:04:36,174
Oh, gee, that's fine.

111
00:04:36,174 --> 00:04:38,777
Kiss Aunt Emmy for me, will you?

112
00:04:38,777 --> 00:04:40,512
Good-bye, unc.

113
00:04:40,512 --> 00:04:43,114
Lucy, we now own a home freezer.

114
00:04:43,114 --> 00:04:44,416
Thank you.

115
00:04:44,416 --> 00:04:45,283
Let's get busy!

116
00:04:45,283 --> 00:04:46,585
Look out!

117
00:04:46,585 --> 00:04:47,886
What are you doing?

118
00:04:47,886 --> 00:04:49,187
Ordering meat.

119
00:04:49,187 --> 00:04:51,356
The sooner we get the meat in the
freezer,

120
00:04:51,356 --> 00:04:53,091
the quicker we'll be saving money.

121
00:04:53,091 --> 00:04:54,826
I wonder how much we ought to order?

122
00:04:54,826 --> 00:04:56,561
Oh, 20, 25 Pounds, maybe 30.

123
00:04:56,561 --> 00:04:57,863
Gee, that sounds like a lot of meat.

124
00:04:57,863 --> 00:04:59,598
Honey! It'll last!

125
00:04:59,598 --> 00:05:00,465
Hello?

126
00:05:00,465 --> 00:05:02,634
Hello, this is Mrs. Ricky Ricardo

127
00:05:03,068 --> 00:05:04,803
at 623 East 68th Street.

128
00:05:04,803 --> 00:05:07,839
I'd like to order some meat for our
freezer.

129
00:05:07,839 --> 00:05:09,140
Beef.

130
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:10,442
Oh, I see.

131
00:05:10,442 --> 00:05:11,743
Just a minute.

132
00:05:11,743 --> 00:05:13,478
It's only 69 cents a pound!

133
00:05:13,478 --> 00:05:14,779
No kidding?

134
00:05:14,779 --> 00:05:16,514
Why, steak's $1.89.

135
00:05:16,514 --> 00:05:18,683
I know, I'd better order right away

136
00:05:18,683 --> 00:05:21,720
before he realizes what a bargain
he's giving us.

137
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:24,322
Uh, all right, that'll be fine.

138
00:05:24,322 --> 00:05:26,491
Oh, by the side?

139
00:05:26,491 --> 00:05:28,226
Oh, well, just a minute.

140
00:05:28,226 --> 00:05:30,395
That's the price by the side.

141
00:05:30,395 --> 00:05:32,564
How big is a side of beef?

142
00:05:32,564 --> 00:05:34,733
Well, a side of bacon is about this
big.

143
00:05:34,733 --> 00:05:36,034
Oh, well, that's okay.

144
00:05:36,468 --> 00:05:39,504
All right, I'll take a side.

145
00:05:39,504 --> 00:05:42,107
Better make it two sides.

146
00:05:42,107 --> 00:05:43,842
One for each of us.

147
00:05:43,842 --> 00:05:46,878
Yeah, can you send it over this
afternoon?

148
00:05:46,878 --> 00:05:48,613
East 68th Street.

149
00:05:48,613 --> 00:05:50,348
That's right, thank you.

150
00:05:50,348 --> 00:05:52,517
In the meantime, we'll go downtown.

151
00:05:52,517 --> 00:05:53,818
What for?

152
00:05:53,818 --> 00:05:55,553
Well, with all that money we're
saving on the freezer,

153
00:05:55,553 --> 00:05:57,289
we can afford to buy ourselves new
dresses.

154
00:05:57,289 --> 00:05:59,024
Hurry up! Get ready!

155
00:06:04,229 --> 00:06:05,964
Oh, yeah, it was a lot of money,

156
00:06:05,964 --> 00:06:08,566
but after all, it's a very basic
style.

157
00:06:08,566 --> 00:06:10,302
I can wear it for years.

158
00:06:10,302 --> 00:06:12,470
Oh, I can hardly wait to try these
things on!

159
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:14,639
I'm going right down to my apartment
and put this on.

160
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:15,941
(knock at door)

161
00:06:15,941 --> 00:06:16,808
Oh!

162
00:06:16,808 --> 00:06:18,543
Say, maybe that's the meat.

163
00:06:21,579 --> 00:06:22,447
Yes, sir?

164
00:06:22,447 --> 00:06:23,748
Mrs. Ricardo?

165
00:06:23,748 --> 00:06:25,050
Yes, sir?

166
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:26,785
Johnson's Meat Company.

167
00:06:26,785 --> 00:06:28,954
Gee, that sure is a lot, isn't it?

168
00:06:28,954 --> 00:06:30,255
Oh, there's more.

169
00:06:30,255 --> 00:06:31,556
Oh?

170
00:06:32,857 --> 00:06:35,026
Look at the way they wrap it.

171
00:06:35,026 --> 00:06:36,328
Yeah.

172
00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:40,231
My goodness.

173
00:06:43,702 --> 00:06:45,437
Oh, hey, are you sure

174
00:06:45,437 --> 00:06:47,605
that's all for us?

175
00:06:47,605 --> 00:06:50,208
Lady, this is only the beginning.

176
00:06:51,076 --> 00:06:53,244
Oh, there must be a mistake.

177
00:06:53,678 --> 00:06:55,413
Oh, that isn't a side of beef.

178
00:06:55,413 --> 00:06:57,582
That must be a side of elephant.

179
00:06:58,450 --> 00:07:01,486
Lucy, what have we got ourselves
into?

180
00:07:01,486 --> 00:07:04,522
Well, what's all this going to cost,
Ethel?

181
00:07:04,522 --> 00:07:07,559
We're getting 700 pounds of meat!

182
00:07:07,559 --> 00:07:09,728
At 69 cents a pound, that's...

183
00:07:09,728 --> 00:07:11,463
$483.

184
00:07:11,463 --> 00:07:12,330
(gasps)

185
00:07:12,330 --> 00:07:14,499
Listen, there's been a mistake.

186
00:07:14,499 --> 00:07:17,102
You're going to have to take most of
this meat back.

187
00:07:17,102 --> 00:07:18,837
All but 30 pounds.
Yeah.

188
00:07:18,837 --> 00:07:20,572
Sorry, ladies, once a side of beef
has been cut,

189
00:07:20,572 --> 00:07:22,741
we're not allowed to bring it back.

190
00:07:23,174 --> 00:07:24,909
Come on, Ethel, let's get busy.

191
00:07:24,909 --> 00:07:26,211
What are we going to do?

192
00:07:26,211 --> 00:07:29,247
I'm going to paste this animal back
together again.

193
00:07:30,982 --> 00:07:33,151
Find the piece that fits that.

194
00:07:33,151 --> 00:07:37,489
Look, ladies, even if you defrosted
it, pasted it together

195
00:07:37,489 --> 00:07:40,959
and taught it to walk, I couldn't
take it back!

196
00:07:44,429 --> 00:07:45,730
Well, that's one side.

197
00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:48,333
Now let's go down and get the other
one.

198
00:07:49,634 --> 00:07:51,369
The other one!

199
00:07:51,369 --> 00:07:53,538
Ricky and Fred are going to kill us!

200
00:07:53,538 --> 00:07:55,273
Yes, but by buying it all wholesale

201
00:07:55,707 --> 00:07:57,442
we saved them at least $500.

202
00:07:57,442 --> 00:07:59,177
I hope you can explain all that

203
00:07:59,177 --> 00:08:02,213
before their fingers tighten around
our throats.

204
00:08:02,213 --> 00:08:04,382
Maybe we could sell some of it!

205
00:08:04,382 --> 00:08:05,250
Sell it?

206
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:07,419
Yeah, you know, we could go to a
butcher shop

207
00:08:07,419 --> 00:08:08,720
and grab some of the customers

208
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,455
before the butcher gets to them.

209
00:08:10,455 --> 00:08:12,190
We could sell this for 79 cents a
pound.

210
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:13,925
But it only cost 69.

211
00:08:13,925 --> 00:08:16,528
Well, we might as well make a little
something on it.

212
00:08:16,528 --> 00:08:18,263
Oh, no, Lucy, we couldn't sell it.

213
00:08:18,263 --> 00:08:19,998
It wouldn't be right.
It wouldn't be fair.

214
00:08:19,998 --> 00:08:21,299
Why not?

215
00:08:21,299 --> 00:08:22,600
It's...

216
00:08:26,938 --> 00:08:29,107
Well, don't just stand there!

217
00:08:29,107 --> 00:08:31,276
We got a lot of meat to sell!

218
00:08:49,928 --> 00:08:55,133
(Lucy whistling)

219
00:08:55,567 --> 00:08:57,302
Get ready for business.

220
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:05,977
Psst!

221
00:09:07,278 --> 00:09:09,447
Psst!

222
00:09:09,447 --> 00:09:10,315
Come here.

223
00:09:11,616 --> 00:09:13,785
Are you tired of paying high prices?

224
00:09:13,785 --> 00:09:16,821
Are you interested in a little
high-class beef?

225
00:09:16,821 --> 00:09:18,556
Do you want a bargain?

226
00:09:18,556 --> 00:09:20,725
Tell you what I'm gonna do.

227
00:09:21,593 --> 00:09:22,460
Step up a little closer

228
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:24,195
I don't want to block the traffic.

229
00:09:24,195 --> 00:09:25,930
Now, you look like a smart dame.

230
00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:26,798
What'll it be?

231
00:09:26,798 --> 00:09:28,099
I got sirloin, tenderloin

232
00:09:28,099 --> 00:09:33,738
T-bone, rump, pot roast, chuck roast,
oxtail stump.

233
00:09:33,738 --> 00:09:36,774
I got a special on T-bone, 79 cents a
pound.

234
00:09:37,208 --> 00:09:39,377
Well, really, I'm...

235
00:09:39,377 --> 00:09:40,678
79 cents!

236
00:09:40,678 --> 00:09:42,413
Shh! Quiet. Get 'em while they last,
lady.

237
00:09:42,413 --> 00:09:44,149
Step right over and help yourself.

238
00:09:44,149 --> 00:09:45,884
Ethel, help the little lady, will
you?

239
00:09:45,884 --> 00:09:46,751
What'll you have?

240
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:48,486
Well, I'd like a sirloin.

241
00:09:48,486 --> 00:09:49,787
A sirloin coming up.

242
00:09:49,787 --> 00:09:51,523
Keep it down, keep it down, kid.

243
00:09:53,691 --> 00:09:55,426
How much does this weigh?

244
00:09:55,426 --> 00:09:56,294
Weigh.

245
00:10:01,933 --> 00:10:03,234
Three pounds.

246
00:10:03,234 --> 00:10:04,536
I'll take it.

247
00:10:09,741 --> 00:10:11,042
Psst!

248
00:10:11,042 --> 00:10:12,777
Come here.

249
00:10:12,777 --> 00:10:15,380
Are you interested in some high-class
beef?

250
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:17,549
Are you tired of paying high prices?

251
00:10:17,549 --> 00:10:18,850
Do you want a bargain?

252
00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:20,585
Tell you what I'm gonna do.

253
00:10:21,019 --> 00:10:22,320
Is this choice meat?

254
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:25,356
Absolutely-- give the little lady her
choice, Ethel.

255
00:10:25,356 --> 00:10:27,091
Tell you what I'm gonna do.

256
00:10:27,091 --> 00:10:28,826
That's not what I meant.

257
00:10:28,826 --> 00:10:30,995
Get away from me, kid, you bother me.

258
00:10:30,995 --> 00:10:32,730
Tell you what I'm gonna do:

259
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:34,899
any cut you want, 79 cents a pound.

260
00:10:34,899 --> 00:10:37,502
But how can you afford to sell it so
cheap?

261
00:10:37,502 --> 00:10:39,237
I'm glad you asked that, lady.

262
00:10:39,237 --> 00:10:40,972
This is all made possible

263
00:10:40,972 --> 00:10:43,141
because we do everything ourselves.

264
00:10:43,141 --> 00:10:45,743
We rope, we brand, we butcher, we
market.

265
00:10:45,743 --> 00:10:48,346
We do everything but eat it for you.

266
00:10:48,346 --> 00:10:50,081
79 cents a pound.

267
00:10:50,081 --> 00:10:51,816
Well, I'll try a round steak.

268
00:10:51,816 --> 00:10:53,551
Okay, step right over here.

269
00:10:53,551 --> 00:10:55,286
A round steak.

270
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,021
Keep it down.

271
00:10:57,021 --> 00:10:59,190
Hey, hey...

272
00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:00,491
Rock-a-bye baby

273
00:11:00,491 --> 00:11:04,395
In the treetop

274
00:11:04,395 --> 00:11:09,167
Rock-a-bye baby in the treetop...

275
00:11:09,167 --> 00:11:10,902
Step right up.

276
00:11:10,902 --> 00:11:11,769
Every...

277
00:11:11,769 --> 00:11:13,071
Ohh!

278
00:11:13,071 --> 00:11:14,806
Amscray, amscray!
Utcherbay.

279
00:11:14,806 --> 00:11:17,408
Watch the papers for our new
location!

280
00:11:17,408 --> 00:11:19,577
Good afternoon.

281
00:12:10,328 --> 00:12:11,629
This is the last.

282
00:12:11,629 --> 00:12:13,798
Oh, thank goodness.

283
00:12:13,798 --> 00:12:18,136
Boy, 700 pounds of meat is a lot to
carry.

284
00:12:18,136 --> 00:12:19,437
Oh!

285
00:12:23,775 --> 00:12:24,642
(inaudible)

286
00:12:30,281 --> 00:12:31,582
You know...

287
00:12:31,582 --> 00:12:34,619
you know, what worries me is how
we're...

288
00:12:34,619 --> 00:12:36,354
Oh! Honey, I'm sor...

289
00:12:36,354 --> 00:12:38,089
Wait till I get the key.

290
00:12:41,125 --> 00:12:43,294
Gee, I'm sorry!

291
00:12:43,294 --> 00:12:45,463
Oh, boy, it gets cold in there in a
hurry!

292
00:12:45,463 --> 00:12:46,764
Yeah, how about that.

293
00:12:46,764 --> 00:12:48,066
You know, this is dangerous

294
00:12:48,066 --> 00:12:49,801
not being able to open that from the
inside.

295
00:12:50,234 --> 00:12:52,403
We'd better have this lock taken off
tomorrow.

296
00:12:52,403 --> 00:12:53,705
Yeah, that's a good idea.

297
00:12:53,705 --> 00:12:54,572
Golly.

298
00:12:54,572 --> 00:12:58,042
Well, Lucy, we did it.

299
00:12:58,042 --> 00:12:59,344
It's all in there.

300
00:12:59,344 --> 00:13:01,946
Yeah... now we just got to explain

301
00:13:01,946 --> 00:13:04,115
all this meat to Ricky and Fred.

302
00:13:04,549 --> 00:13:05,416
Yeah.

303
00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:08,019
You don't suppose they'd believe

304
00:13:08,019 --> 00:13:11,055
that a cow wandered in there and fell
apart?

305
00:13:15,827 --> 00:13:17,128
Nope.

306
00:13:17,128 --> 00:13:18,429
No, I guess not.

307
00:13:18,429 --> 00:13:20,598
(Ricky and Fred talking)

308
00:13:20,598 --> 00:13:21,466
What's that?

309
00:13:21,466 --> 00:13:22,333
It's Ricky and Fred.

310
00:13:22,333 --> 00:13:23,634
They're coming down here!

311
00:13:23,634 --> 00:13:25,370
Oh, no, they're up in the apartment.

312
00:13:25,370 --> 00:13:27,105
We're hearing them through the
furnace.

313
00:13:27,105 --> 00:13:27,972
Are you sure?

314
00:13:27,972 --> 00:13:29,273
Sure, I'll show you.

315
00:13:29,273 --> 00:13:31,442
Don't touch that, honey, it's hot!

316
00:13:31,442 --> 00:13:33,611
No, Fred's fixing it, remember?

317
00:13:33,611 --> 00:13:34,479
Oh.

318
00:13:34,479 --> 00:13:36,214
I wonder what Ricky's doing home
already.

319
00:13:36,214 --> 00:13:38,816
I'll see.

320
00:13:38,816 --> 00:13:40,118
Lucy, they're looking for us!

321
00:13:40,118 --> 00:13:41,853
What are we gonna tell them?

322
00:13:41,853 --> 00:13:43,588
Well, come on, we can't let them find
us down here.

323
00:13:43,588 --> 00:13:44,889
Hurry up!

324
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:52,697
Well, Ethel, look who's here!

325
00:13:52,697 --> 00:13:54,866
ETHEL: Why, it's Ricky and Fred!

326
00:13:54,866 --> 00:13:56,601
LUCY: Yeah.

327
00:13:56,601 --> 00:13:58,770
Girls, we want to talk to you.

328
00:13:58,770 --> 00:14:00,505
About what?

329
00:14:00,505 --> 00:14:02,673
I ran into Uncle Oscar today.

330
00:14:02,673 --> 00:14:04,409
Start packing, Ethel.

331
00:14:04,409 --> 00:14:06,144
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

332
00:14:06,144 --> 00:14:07,445
We're not mad at you.

333
00:14:07,445 --> 00:14:09,180
We think it's a wonderful idea

334
00:14:09,614 --> 00:14:10,915
that you got the freezer.

335
00:14:10,915 --> 00:14:13,084
Yeah, that was a real smart business
deal.

336
00:14:13,084 --> 00:14:15,253
Yeah, how about that?

337
00:14:15,253 --> 00:14:16,554
In fact, we think you did so well
getting the freezer

338
00:14:16,554 --> 00:14:18,723
that we want to do our share, too.

339
00:14:18,723 --> 00:14:20,458
RICKY: That's right,

340
00:14:20,892 --> 00:14:23,060
and just to get you started,

341
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:24,362
here's what we got.

342
00:14:27,398 --> 00:14:29,133
30 pounds of meat.

343
00:14:29,133 --> 00:14:31,302
Gee, swell.

344
00:14:32,603 --> 00:14:33,905
Gee.

345
00:14:33,905 --> 00:14:36,507
You ever saw that much meat in your
whole life?

346
00:14:39,977 --> 00:14:41,279
No.

347
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:43,881
Boy, that sure is a lot, isn't it,
Ethel?

348
00:14:43,881 --> 00:14:46,918
Well, come on, let's get it down to
the freezer.

349
00:14:46,918 --> 00:14:47,785
Yeah, let's put it in the freezer,
come on.

350
00:14:47,785 --> 00:14:49,086
No, no, wait a minute.

351
00:14:49,086 --> 00:14:50,388
I have a couple of steaks.

352
00:14:50,388 --> 00:14:52,990
I think we ought to do it all in one
trip.

353
00:14:52,990 --> 00:14:54,292
Come here and help me, Ethel.

354
00:14:54,292 --> 00:14:55,593
What's with her?

355
00:14:55,593 --> 00:14:58,629
Listen, you stall them while I get
that meat out of the freezer.

356
00:14:58,629 --> 00:14:59,497
How can I stall them?

357
00:14:59,497 --> 00:15:01,666
Listen, if I can move 700 pounds of
meat

358
00:15:01,666 --> 00:15:03,835
you ought to be able to keep two
husbands occupied

359
00:15:03,835 --> 00:15:05,136
for a couple of minutes.

360
00:15:05,136 --> 00:15:06,437
Well, what can I do?

361
00:15:06,437 --> 00:15:08,172
Dance with them, talk, sing.

362
00:15:08,172 --> 00:15:09,907
That's it, ask Ricky to sing.

363
00:15:09,907 --> 00:15:11,642
Sing?
You know he won't.

364
00:15:11,642 --> 00:15:13,811
Oh, won't he? Listen, you take care
of the ham.

365
00:15:13,811 --> 00:15:15,546
I'll take care of the beef.

366
00:15:20,751 --> 00:15:22,053
Hi, fellas.

367
00:15:22,053 --> 00:15:23,788
Hi. What's the delay?

368
00:15:23,788 --> 00:15:24,655
Delay?

369
00:15:24,655 --> 00:15:25,957
Where's Lucy?
Come on.

370
00:15:25,957 --> 00:15:27,692
Lucy?

371
00:15:27,692 --> 00:15:30,294
Um, uh... uh, she, uh...
she, uh...

372
00:15:30,294 --> 00:15:32,463
The freezer was dirty and she wanted
to go down

373
00:15:32,463 --> 00:15:34,198
and clean it all up before you saw
it.

374
00:15:34,198 --> 00:15:35,500
Oh, honey, what's the difference?

375
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:36,801
Come on, we want to see it.

376
00:15:36,801 --> 00:15:37,668
Let's go down there.

377
00:15:37,668 --> 00:15:38,536
Come on, let's go down.

378
00:15:38,536 --> 00:15:39,403
No, wait a minute, Fred.

379
00:15:39,403 --> 00:15:42,440
You know Lucy, if she...
uh... if, uh...

380
00:15:42,874 --> 00:15:44,609
Ricky, I think you sing better

381
00:15:44,609 --> 00:15:46,777
than anybody in the whole world.

382
00:15:46,777 --> 00:15:48,079
Would you sing for me?

383
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:49,380
Sing? Now?

384
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:50,248
Yeah, now.

385
00:15:50,248 --> 00:15:51,549
What's the matter with you?

386
00:15:51,549 --> 00:15:53,117
Are you losing your mind?

387
00:15:53,117 --> 00:15:55,019
Come on, we've got a freezer down
there

388
00:15:55,019 --> 00:15:56,320
and a lot of meat to put in it.

389
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,622
Now let's go right now.

390
00:15:57,622 --> 00:15:58,923
Wait, wait a minute, Fred.

391
00:15:58,923 --> 00:15:59,790
Wait a minute.

392
00:16:02,393 --> 00:16:04,996
If Ethel wants to hear me sing that
bad, I...

393
00:16:04,996 --> 00:16:07,164
gee, I wouldn't want to deprive her

394
00:16:07,164 --> 00:16:08,900
of the pleasure of it.

395
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:09,767
Oh, no.

396
00:16:11,936 --> 00:16:13,671
Well, you'd like to hear me sing, eh?

397
00:16:13,671 --> 00:16:15,406
All right.

398
00:16:15,406 --> 00:16:17,575
You really think I sing good, huh?

399
00:16:17,575 --> 00:16:19,744
Gee, that's very nice of you.

400
00:16:19,744 --> 00:16:21,479
What would you like to hear?

401
00:16:21,479 --> 00:16:23,648
Anything with a lot of choruses.

402
00:16:23,648 --> 00:16:26,250
Oh, boy, a lot of choruses, eh?

403
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:27,552
All right.

404
00:16:27,552 --> 00:16:28,853
Here's one.

405
00:16:31,022 --> 00:16:32,757
Ay mama, ay nene

406
00:16:32,757 --> 00:16:34,492
Ay mama, ay nene...

407
00:16:34,492 --> 00:16:36,227
Aw, Ricky!

408
00:16:36,227 --> 00:16:40,565
Todos los negros tomamos cafe

409
00:16:40,565 --> 00:16:42,733
Ay mama, ay nene

410
00:16:42,733 --> 00:16:44,902
Ay mama, ay nene

411
00:16:44,902 --> 00:16:50,107
Todos los negros tomamos cafe

412
00:16:50,107 --> 00:16:52,710
Pero belen, belen, belen

413
00:16:52,710 --> 00:16:54,879
Adonde estabas metia

414
00:16:54,879 --> 00:16:57,048
Yo fui hasta jesus maria

415
00:16:57,048 --> 00:17:00,952
Yo te buscaba y no te encontre...

416
00:17:04,422 --> 00:17:06,591
Ay mama, ay nene

417
00:17:06,591 --> 00:17:08,759
Ay mama, ay nene

418
00:17:08,759 --> 00:17:13,531
Todos los negros tomamos cafe

419
00:17:13,531 --> 00:17:15,700

Bravo! Bravo!

440
00:18:19,463 --> 00:18:21,198
Oh, isn't he wonderful, Fred?

441
00:18:21,632 --> 00:18:22,500
Yeah, yeah.

442
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:24,235
Sing another one, Ricky.

443
00:18:24,235 --> 00:18:26,404
All right, what you like to hear now?

444
00:18:26,404 --> 00:18:29,440
How about that dandy little ditty
entitled

445
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:31,609
"Let's vamooso to el freezo"?

446
00:18:34,645 --> 00:18:36,380
What would you like to hear, Ethel?

447
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:37,682
Anything.

448
00:18:37,682 --> 00:18:40,284
All right, here's one you should
like.

449
00:18:42,453 --> 00:18:50,695
Ese lunar que tienes, cielito lindo,
junto a la boca

450
00:18:50,695 --> 00:18:58,502
No se lo des a nadi, cielito lindo,
que a mi me toca

451
00:18:58,502 --> 00:19:02,840
Ay, ay, ay, ay

00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:06,310
Canta y no llores

453
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:14,985
Porque cantando se alegran, cielito
lindo, los corazones

454
00:19:14,985 --> 00:19:18,889
Ay, ay, ay, ay

455
00:19:18,889 --> 00:19:22,359
Canta y no llores

456
00:19:22,359 --> 00:19:30,167
Porque cantando se alegran, cielito
lindo, los corazones

457
00:19:30,167 --> 00:19:37,108
Ese lunar que tienes, cielito lindo,
junto a la boca...

458
00:20:01,832 --> 00:20:03,134
Here we come, Lucy.

459
00:20:03,134 --> 00:20:06,604
Have you got it all cleaned up, Lucy?

460
00:20:06,604 --> 00:20:07,905
Lucy?

461
00:20:09,206 --> 00:20:10,508
Hey, this is great, Fred.

462
00:20:10,508 --> 00:20:11,809
This is wonderful.

463
00:20:11,809 --> 00:20:13,978
Yeah, look how big and roomy.

464
00:20:13,978 --> 00:20:16,580
I bet you could hang a whole side of
beef in there.

465
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:17,882
Are you kidding?
I bet that you...

466
00:20:17,882 --> 00:20:18,749
(screams)

467
00:20:24,388 --> 00:20:25,256
Oh!

468
00:20:29,593 --> 00:20:31,328
Oh, Lucy!

469
00:20:32,196 --> 00:20:35,232
Oh, Ricky, Ricky, she's freezing.

470
00:20:35,232 --> 00:20:37,401
Lucy, you come out of there!

471
00:20:38,269 --> 00:20:39,570
Come out of there now!

472
00:20:39,570 --> 00:20:40,871
Oh, she's locked in!

473
00:20:40,871 --> 00:20:42,606
Well, where's the key?

474
00:20:42,606 --> 00:20:44,341
ALL: Where's the key, Lucy?

475
00:20:44,341 --> 00:20:45,643
The key, Lucy?

476
00:20:45,643 --> 00:20:47,812
The key for the door, where's the
key?

477
00:20:47,812 --> 00:20:49,547
The key, honey, where is it?

478
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:51,282
Where did you put it?

479
00:20:51,282 --> 00:20:52,583
Where's the key?
Haven't you got the key?

480
00:20:56,921 --> 00:20:59,089
Oh, honey...

481
00:20:59,089 --> 00:21:01,692
honey, don't cry, honey, don't cry!

482
00:21:01,692 --> 00:21:02,993
Don't cry.

483
00:21:02,993 --> 00:21:03,861
I'll go and get a crowbar

484
00:21:03,861 --> 00:21:05,162
and we'll pry it open.

485
00:21:05,162 --> 00:21:06,030
Well, hurry up, will you?

486
00:21:06,030 --> 00:21:08,632
Honey... oh, honey, don't cry!

487
00:21:08,632 --> 00:21:09,934
Honey, don't cry!

488
00:21:10,367 --> 00:21:11,669
Boo-hoo-hoo-hoo!
Don't!

489
00:21:11,669 --> 00:21:13,404
Boo-hoo-hoo!
Don't, honey, no.

490
00:21:13,404 --> 00:21:16,440
Her tears are frozen!

491
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:18,175
Yeah.
Oh, honey...

492
00:21:18,175 --> 00:21:19,476
Oh, my God, no...

493
00:21:19,910 --> 00:21:20,778
Honey!

494
00:21:21,212 --> 00:21:22,513
Honey!

00:21:22,513 --> 00:21:23,814
Don't jump all around!

496
00:21:23,814 --> 00:21:25,115
No, don't!
No, honey!

497
00:21:25,115 --> 00:21:27,284
You'll use the oxygen! Don't!

498
00:21:27,284 --> 00:21:28,586
Oxygen?

499
00:21:28,586 --> 00:21:30,321
Yeah, jumping around.

500
00:21:30,321 --> 00:21:31,622
No, honey, no.

501
00:21:31,622 --> 00:21:34,658
No, not good-bye, no, just stand
still.

502
00:21:34,658 --> 00:21:36,393
Lay against the wall-- rest.

503
00:21:36,393 --> 00:21:38,562
Lay against the wall-- stand still!

504
00:21:38,562 --> 00:21:40,297
Stand still against the wall.

505
00:21:40,297 --> 00:21:41,165
Rest, honey.

506
00:21:41,165 --> 00:21:42,466
Oh, here it is.

507
00:21:42,466 --> 00:21:43,767
Here we go.

508
00:21:45,936 --> 00:21:48,105
Are you getting it?

509
00:21:48,105 --> 00:21:48,973
I think we got it.

510
00:21:48,973 --> 00:21:50,708
Here we go.

511
00:21:50,708 --> 00:21:53,310
Oh, my goodness!

512
00:21:53,310 --> 00:21:55,045
Oh!

513
00:21:56,780 --> 00:21:58,082
She's stiff as a poker!

514
00:21:58,082 --> 00:21:58,949
I know it.

515
00:21:58,949 --> 00:22:00,684
Wait a minute.
Wait, hold it, I'll get it

516
00:22:01,118 --> 00:22:02,853
Don't worry, just, just hold her a
minute.

517
00:22:02,853 --> 00:22:03,721
Hold it.

518
00:22:03,721 --> 00:22:04,588
I'll get her back here.

519
00:22:04,588 --> 00:22:05,890
Let me help.

520
00:22:05,890 --> 00:22:06,757
Get her feet, Fred.

521
00:22:06,757 --> 00:22:08,492
Get her feet!

522
00:22:08,492 --> 00:22:10,227
Get her feet!
Let me help.

523
00:22:10,227 --> 00:22:11,962
Easy! Easy now!

524
00:22:11,962 --> 00:22:13,264
Hey, fellas, easy!

525
00:22:13,264 --> 00:22:14,999
Easy going around corners!

526
00:22:14,999 --> 00:22:16,734
You might snap off an arm!

527
00:22:16,734 --> 00:22:18,035
All right, take it easy!

528
00:22:18,035 --> 00:22:19,336
All right, come on.

529
00:22:19,336 --> 00:22:20,638
Now duck your head.

530
00:22:20,638 --> 00:22:22,806
Watch her arm, watch her arm!

531
00:22:22,806 --> 00:22:23,674
Hold it, hold it!

532
00:22:26,277 --> 00:22:28,879
(teeth chattering)

533
00:22:32,783 --> 00:22:35,819
Have some more hot soup, Lucy.

534
00:22:39,723 --> 00:22:41,025
Oh, thank you.

535
00:22:41,025 --> 00:22:43,627
Honey, you sure you're going to be
all right?

536
00:22:43,627 --> 00:22:47,097
Y-y-y-y-yeah, p-p-p-put the blanket
up another notch.

537
00:22:47,097 --> 00:22:47,965
All right.

538
00:22:47,965 --> 00:22:50,134
We can be sure of one thing.

539
00:22:50,134 --> 00:22:51,869
That freezer really freezes.

540
00:22:51,869 --> 00:22:54,905
Oh, boy, you can s-s-say that again.

541
00:22:55,339 --> 00:22:58,809
Well, how's our little quick-frozen
redhead?

542
00:22:58,809 --> 00:23:00,110
Okay, Fred.

543
00:23:00,110 --> 00:23:01,412
Good.

544
00:23:01,412 --> 00:23:02,713
Hey!

545
00:23:02,713 --> 00:23:03,580
(sniffing)

546
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:05,316
What smells so good?

547
00:23:05,316 --> 00:23:07,484
It certainly makes me hungry,
whatever it is.

548
00:23:07,484 --> 00:23:08,352
Yeah.

549
00:23:08,786 --> 00:23:10,521
Hey, smells like somebody's cooking a
roast.

550
00:23:10,521 --> 00:23:11,822
Yeah.

551
00:23:11,822 --> 00:23:13,123
Yeah.

552
00:23:13,123 --> 00:23:15,726
Smells delicious.

553
00:23:15,726 --> 00:23:17,027
Yeah.

554
00:23:17,027 --> 00:23:19,196
Fred, where were you just now?

555
00:23:19,196 --> 00:23:20,931
Down lighting the furnace, why?

556
00:23:20,931 --> 00:23:23,100
Unplug me! Unplug me! Unplug me!

557
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:24,401
What's the matter with you?

558
00:23:24,401 --> 00:23:26,136
What's the matter, Lucy?!

559
00:23:26,136 --> 00:23:27,438
Lucy, where are you going?

560
00:23:27,438 --> 00:23:28,739
Don't ask questions.

561
00:23:28,739 --> 00:23:31,775
Just get a knife and a fork and a
bottle of ketchup

562
00:23:31,775 --> 00:23:35,679
and follow me to the biggest barbecue
in the whole world!

00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:34,767
Hi, honey.

2
00:00:35,201 --> 00:00:36,069
Hi.

3
00:00:36,069 --> 00:00:37,370
What are you doing?

4
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:39,105
Darning your socks.

5
00:00:39,105 --> 00:00:40,406
Well, good for you.

6
00:00:40,406 --> 00:00:42,575
I didn't know you knew how to darn.

7
00:00:42,575 --> 00:00:43,876
Oh, sure, there's nothing to it,

8
00:00:43,876 --> 00:00:45,611
especially if you have a darning egg.

9
00:00:45,611 --> 00:00:47,780
Boy, you should have seen the hole in
this one.

10
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:49,949
It's taken me half an hour to sew it
up.

11
00:00:49,949 --> 00:00:50,817
Hmm.

12
00:00:50,817 --> 00:00:52,552
There.

13
00:00:58,624 --> 00:01:00,793
Darn it, I sewed up the top.

14
00:01:01,227 --> 00:01:02,528
(chuckles)

15
00:01:02,528 --> 00:01:03,830
Oh, Lucy, you're amazing.

16
00:01:04,263 --> 00:01:05,998
Oh, well, I'll just have to rip it
out.

17
00:01:06,432 --> 00:01:07,734
No, no, don't do that.
Why?

18
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:09,902
I can use it as a blackjack.

19
00:01:09,902 --> 00:01:10,770
Oh, give me that.

20
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:12,071
No, I've got to fix it.

21
00:01:12,071 --> 00:01:13,373

22
00:01:13,373 --> 00:01:14,240
Oh, dear.

23
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,975
Honey, where are you going?

24
00:01:15,975 --> 00:01:17,276
I'm going to rehearsal, honey.

25
00:01:17,276 --> 00:01:19,879
Again? You've been to rehearsal every
day for a week.

26
00:01:19,879 --> 00:01:21,180
I know, but I can't help it.

27
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:23,349
Wouldn't it be easier to get good
musicians?

28
00:01:23,349 --> 00:01:26,819

00:01:41,567 --> 00:01:43,736
putting the whole television show
together

38
00:01:43,736 --> 00:01:45,905
without having to look for a girl

39
00:01:45,905 --> 00:01:47,206
to do the commercial?

40
00:01:50,243 --> 00:01:51,110
Uh... uh...

41
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:52,845
Cuantas veces ha dicho

42
00:01:52,845 --> 00:01:54,580
que no me llame a la casa?

43
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:56,315
Never mind, never mind.

44
00:01:56,315 --> 00:01:58,484
I know what you're talking about.

45
00:01:58,484 --> 00:02:00,219
What about a television show, Ricky?

46
00:02:00,219 --> 00:02:01,521
Wait a minute.

47
00:02:01,521 --> 00:02:02,388
All right, Jerry.

48
00:02:02,388 --> 00:02:04,991
I'll get the girl to do the
commercial.

49
00:02:04,991 --> 00:02:05,858
Good-bye.

50
00:02:05,858 --> 00:02:07,160
Well?

51
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:09,762
Well, I'm going to do a television
show.

52
00:02:09,762 --> 00:02:11,063
That's all.

53
00:02:11,063 --> 00:02:12,365
And you cannot be on it.

54
00:02:12,365 --> 00:02:13,666
Oh, Ricky, please?

55
00:02:13,666 --> 00:02:15,401
Just let me do the commercial.

56
00:02:15,401 --> 00:02:16,269
Nothing doing.

57
00:02:16,269 --> 00:02:17,570
Why not?

58
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:19,739
Look, honey, this is too big a chance
for me.

59
00:02:19,739 --> 00:02:21,474
I need someone with a lot of
'sperience.

60
00:02:21,474 --> 00:02:24,076
Well, I've had "'sperience."

61
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:27,980
You never even been on a television
show.

62
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:31,017
Well, maybe not, but I've watched
them a lot.

63
00:02:31,017 --> 00:02:32,318
There's a slight difference.

64
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:33,619
Oh, now, Ricky...

65
00:02:33,619 --> 00:02:35,354
I'm sorry, honey-- I got to go now.

66
00:02:35,354 --> 00:02:36,222
I'll see you later.

67
00:02:36,222 --> 00:02:37,523
Oh!

68
00:02:37,523 --> 00:02:39,258
Oh!

69
00:02:43,162 --> 00:02:44,030
Hi, Lucy.

70
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:45,765
Hi.

71
00:02:45,765 --> 00:02:47,066
Need any work done up here?

72
00:02:47,066 --> 00:02:49,235
Ethel's gone to see her mother for a
couple of days

73
00:02:49,235 --> 00:02:50,536
and I got a lot of time.

74
00:02:50,536 --> 00:02:53,139
Ethel's gone and you want to work?

75
00:02:53,139 --> 00:02:54,874
Yeah, it seems loafing isn't any fun

76
00:02:54,874 --> 00:02:57,477
unless she's nagging at me to get
some work done.

77
00:02:59,645 --> 00:03:00,947
Well, there's nothing to do up here

78
00:03:00,947 --> 00:03:03,983
unless you want a job knocking some
sense into Ricky's head.

79
00:03:03,983 --> 00:03:04,851
What's the matter?

80
00:03:05,284 --> 00:03:06,586
Well, he's going to emcee a big
television show

81
00:03:06,586 --> 00:03:09,188
and they need a girl to do the
commercial.

82
00:03:09,188 --> 00:03:10,490
Now you know how good I am at that.

83
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:12,225
Oh, sure, I've seen you do

84
00:03:12,225 --> 00:03:14,393
a hundred television commercials.

85
00:03:14,393 --> 00:03:15,261
Well, I would be good

86
00:03:15,261 --> 00:03:17,430
if somebody would ever give me a
chance.

87
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:18,297
Now, why don't you just relax

88
00:03:18,297 --> 00:03:20,032
and forget the whole thing?

89
00:03:20,032 --> 00:03:21,767
Gee, if there was only some way

90
00:03:21,767 --> 00:03:23,069
Ricky could see me on television.

91
00:03:23,069 --> 00:03:26,973
Well, now, maybe you'd qualify as a
lady wrestler.

92
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,141
Wait a minute, wait a minute!
I got it!

93
00:03:29,141 --> 00:03:30,877
I know what I'm going to do.
What?

94
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:33,045
Well, listen, when Ricky comes home
tonight

95
00:03:33,045 --> 00:03:35,214
I'm not going to be here, but you
are.

96
00:03:35,214 --> 00:03:36,516
Oh, I am, huh?

97
00:03:36,516 --> 00:03:38,684
Yeah, and you're going to turn on
that television set,

98
00:03:38,684 --> 00:03:40,853
and you know who's going to be on it?

99
00:03:40,853 --> 00:03:43,022
Well, I can only hope it's Faye
Emerson.

100
00:03:43,022 --> 00:03:44,757
No, no, it's going to be me.

101
00:03:44,757 --> 00:03:46,926
Well, how are you going to work that
out?

102
00:03:46,926 --> 00:03:49,095
Never mind, you just turn on that set

103
00:03:49,095 --> 00:03:50,830
and leave the rest to me, okay,
buster?

104
00:03:58,638 --> 00:04:00,373
Oh, hello, Fred.

105
00:04:00,373 --> 00:04:01,674
Oh, hi, Rick.

106
00:04:01,674 --> 00:04:02,542
Where's Lucy?

107
00:04:02,542 --> 00:04:03,409
I don't know.

108
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:04,710
I came up to watch your television.

109
00:04:05,144 --> 00:04:06,012
Ours is on the blink.

110
00:04:06,012 --> 00:04:06,879
Oh?

111
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:09,916
And there's a wonderful show coming
on just about now.

112
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:10,783
At 23 minutes after 4:00?

113
00:04:10,783 --> 00:04:11,651
Yeah, now, sit down there.

114
00:04:11,651 --> 00:04:13,386
I want you to watch it.

115
00:04:13,386 --> 00:04:14,253
You'll enjoy it.

116
00:04:17,723 --> 00:04:23,362
Call... for...
Philip Morris!

117
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:28,568
Ay-ay-ay-ay-ay.

118
00:04:28,568 --> 00:04:30,303
Look, look, Rick, that's Lucy.

119
00:04:30,736 --> 00:04:31,604
She's on television.

120
00:04:32,038 --> 00:04:33,339
Yeah, how about that?

121
00:04:33,339 --> 00:04:34,640
I can't get over

122
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:36,375
how clear the picture is.

123
00:04:36,375 --> 00:04:37,243
Yeah.

124
00:04:37,243 --> 00:04:39,845
Da-da ta-da-da-da!

125
00:04:46,352 --> 00:04:48,087
Well, what do you know?

126
00:04:48,087 --> 00:04:49,822
Third-dimensional television.

127
00:04:49,822 --> 00:04:51,123
Yeah.

128
00:04:51,123 --> 00:04:51,991
Shh.

129
00:04:52,425 --> 00:04:53,726
Da-da ta-da-da-da!

130
00:04:53,726 --> 00:04:56,762
Philip Morris, America's most
enjoyable cigarette,

131
00:04:56,762 --> 00:04:59,799
presents the Lucy Ricardo Show.

132
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:01,968
Da-da ta-da-da-da!

133
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:03,703
I don't think this is such a hot
show, Fred.

134
00:05:03,703 --> 00:05:05,871
I think I'll get another station.

135
00:05:05,871 --> 00:05:08,040
As our first offering this evening,
we...

136
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,775
Stop that now!
Go back and sit down!

137
00:05:13,245 --> 00:05:14,547
That's very funny.

138
00:05:14,547 --> 00:05:15,848
Now, come on out of there.

139
00:05:15,848 --> 00:05:18,017
As our first offering this evening,
we present...

140
00:05:18,017 --> 00:05:19,752
Lucy, I said come on out of there.

141
00:05:19,752 --> 00:05:21,921
As our first offering this evening,
we present

142
00:05:21,921 --> 00:05:23,656
that inimitable personality

143
00:05:23,656 --> 00:05:25,825
that talented performer

144
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:27,994
that versatile entertainer...

145
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:29,295
Lucy Ricardo!

146
00:05:29,295 --> 00:05:33,199
(screaming)

147
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:35,368
Ricky! Ricky!

148
00:05:35,368 --> 00:05:37,103
What are you trying to do?!

149
00:05:37,103 --> 00:05:38,404
Are you crazy or something?

150
00:05:38,404 --> 00:05:41,007
What are you trying to do, barbecue
me?

151
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:41,874
I'm sorry.

152
00:05:41,874 --> 00:05:43,175
Are you really sorry?

153
00:05:43,175 --> 00:05:44,910
Of course I'm really sorry.

154
00:05:45,344 --> 00:05:46,212
Are you truly sorry?

155
00:05:46,212 --> 00:05:47,079
Yeah.

156
00:05:47,079 --> 00:05:48,381
Well, are you sorry enough

157
00:05:48,381 --> 00:05:49,248
to let me do the commercial?

158
00:05:49,248 --> 00:05:50,116
No.

159
00:05:50,116 --> 00:05:51,417
Oh, why not?

160
00:05:51,417 --> 00:05:54,020
Look, honey, even if I wanted to give
you the job, I couldn't.

161
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,321
I already hired another girl.

162
00:05:55,321 --> 00:05:56,622
Oh...

163
00:05:56,622 --> 00:05:58,357
Say, what did you do with all the
works?

164
00:05:58,357 --> 00:06:00,960
I took them out.

165
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,129
Well, I can see that, but where is
it?

166
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:05,731
It?

167
00:06:05,731 --> 00:06:07,466
Yeah.

168
00:06:08,768 --> 00:06:10,936
The chassis slides right out.

169
00:06:10,936 --> 00:06:13,105
All in one piece?

170
00:06:15,274 --> 00:06:17,443
Yeah, all in one piece.

171
00:06:17,443 --> 00:06:18,744
Eww...

172
00:06:21,781 --> 00:06:24,817
What do you mean, "eww"?

173
00:06:24,817 --> 00:06:26,118
Well...

174
00:06:26,118 --> 00:06:27,420
Lucy, what have you done?

175
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:30,022
Well, I didn't know it all came out
together.

176
00:06:30,022 --> 00:06:31,323
So?

177
00:06:31,323 --> 00:06:33,059
So, I took it out one piece at a
time.

178
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:34,794
Oh, no!

179
00:06:34,794 --> 00:06:36,529
Oh, no!

180
00:06:45,204 --> 00:06:47,807
Lucy, I've got to be at a television
rehearsal

181
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:48,674
in half an hour.

182
00:06:48,674 --> 00:06:50,409
Is my breakfast ready?

183
00:06:54,747 --> 00:06:57,783
Are you still not speaking to me?

184
00:06:57,783 --> 00:06:59,518
Look...

185
00:06:59,518 --> 00:07:01,253
I don't care if you don't want to
talk to me or not,

186
00:07:01,687 --> 00:07:02,988
but please get up and fix my
breakfast.

187
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:06,025
I need my strength.

188
00:07:07,326 --> 00:07:09,061
Lucy, are you going to fix

189
00:07:09,061 --> 00:07:10,362
my breakfast or not?

190
00:07:10,362 --> 00:07:12,531
What do you want me to do, starve to
death?

191
00:07:12,531 --> 00:07:15,134
Would you, please?

192
00:07:19,472 --> 00:07:21,640
Look, I had a perfect right to bawl
you out.

193
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:23,809
Putting that television set together

194
00:07:23,809 --> 00:07:26,412
is going to cost a fortune, maybe
more.

195
00:07:26,412 --> 00:07:27,947
I'm glad it's broken.

196
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:29,281
Glad?

197
00:07:29,281 --> 00:07:30,316
Yes, now I won't have to look

198
00:07:30,316 --> 00:07:32,051
at your silly Cuban mug on that show
tonight.

199
00:07:32,051 --> 00:07:34,220
Ay, que barbaridad.

200
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:36,388
No se lo que le paso a esta mujer.

201
00:07:36,388 --> 00:07:37,690
Cada vez, cada semana

202
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:39,425
se pone peor y peor la cabeza.

203
00:07:39,425 --> 00:07:40,726
Yo me voy a ir de aqui.

204
00:07:40,726 --> 00:07:42,895
Esta completamente equivocada de
todo.

205
00:07:43,329 --> 00:07:44,630
No se lo que le paso.

206
00:07:46,365 --> 00:07:48,100
Hello.

207
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:51,570
Oh, Fred, could you come up for a
minute, please?

208
00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:55,040
Senora Ricardo and I are not speaking
to each other

209
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:57,643
and I'd like you to do me a favor.

210
00:07:57,643 --> 00:07:58,944
Thank you, Fred.

211
00:08:08,053 --> 00:08:09,789
Hi, Rick, what do you want?

212
00:08:09,789 --> 00:08:12,391
Oh, listen, Fred, I got to go to
rehearsal right away

213
00:08:12,391 --> 00:08:14,994
and I'm expecting a very important
phone call

214
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:16,295
and Lucy's mad at me.

215
00:08:16,295 --> 00:08:17,596
So would you please stay here

216
00:08:17,596 --> 00:08:19,331
and give someone a message?

217
00:08:19,331 --> 00:08:20,199
Sure.

218
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:21,066
Well, the girl

219
00:08:21,066 --> 00:08:22,802
that is gonna do the television
commercial

220
00:08:22,802 --> 00:08:24,103
is going to call.

221
00:08:24,103 --> 00:08:24,970
Now you tell her to be

222
00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:26,705
at Studio 10, Television Center,

223
00:08:26,705 --> 00:08:28,007
at 1:00 this afternoon.

224
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:29,308
All right.

225
00:08:29,308 --> 00:08:30,176
Thanks a lot, Fred.

226
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:31,043
You're welcome.

227
00:08:31,043 --> 00:08:31,911
See you later.

228
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:44,056
Oh, hello, Fred.

229
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:45,357
What are you doing here?

230
00:08:45,357 --> 00:08:46,659
Oh, hi, Ricky asked me

231
00:08:46,659 --> 00:08:48,828
to wait here and take a telephone
message.

232
00:08:48,828 --> 00:08:51,864
He told me that you two aren't
speaking to each other.

233
00:08:51,864 --> 00:08:53,599
Oh, well... I'll take the call, Fred.

234
00:08:53,599 --> 00:08:55,768
It's silly to have you wait up here.

235
00:08:55,768 --> 00:08:57,503
All right, it's from the girl

236
00:08:57,503 --> 00:08:59,238
who's doing the commercials

237
00:08:59,238 --> 00:09:00,539
on Ricky's television show tonight,

238
00:09:00,973 --> 00:09:02,274
and he wants her to be sure and get
the message.

239
00:09:02,274 --> 00:09:03,576
Now, you won't mind this, Lucy?

240
00:09:03,576 --> 00:09:05,744
Oh, no, not at all.

241
00:09:05,744 --> 00:09:07,913
Television center, Studio 10, 1:00.

242
00:09:07,913 --> 00:09:09,215
Yeah.

243
00:09:11,383 --> 00:09:13,118
Hey, how did you know that?

244
00:09:13,118 --> 00:09:14,854
Oh, well, that's where Ricky does

245
00:09:14,854 --> 00:09:16,155
all of his television shows.

246
00:09:16,155 --> 00:09:17,022
Oh.

247
00:09:17,456 --> 00:09:18,757
Well, I'll see you later.

248
00:09:18,757 --> 00:09:19,625
Okay.

249
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:20,926
Bye.

250
00:09:20,926 --> 00:09:21,794
Bye.

251
00:09:23,529 --> 00:09:26,131
(phone rings)

252
00:09:26,131 --> 00:09:27,433
Hello.

253
00:09:27,433 --> 00:09:30,903
Oh, no, Mr. Ricardo isn't here.

254
00:09:30,903 --> 00:09:33,072
Oh, yes, yes, he wanted me to give
you a message.

255
00:09:33,072 --> 00:09:35,241
He said to tell you that he's very
sorry

256
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:37,409
but they've already hired another
girl

257
00:09:37,409 --> 00:09:38,711
to do the commercial

258
00:09:38,711 --> 00:09:41,313
and they won't be needing you after
all.

259
00:09:41,313 --> 00:09:43,048
Good-bye.

260
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:47,820
Deedly deedly dee, deedly deedly
dee...

261
00:09:55,628 --> 00:09:57,796
Okay, Joe, I'm ready to rehearse the
commercial.

262
00:09:57,796 --> 00:09:58,230
Where's the girl?

263
00:09:58,230 --> 00:09:59,531
She's studying her script.

264
00:09:59,531 --> 00:10:00,399
She'll be right in here.

265
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:01,267
This the new sponsor?

266
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:02,568
Yeah.

267
00:10:02,568 --> 00:10:03,435
Stuff any good?

268
00:10:03,435 --> 00:10:04,737
Well, it ought to be.

269
00:10:04,737 --> 00:10:06,038
It's got everything in it--

270
00:10:06,038 --> 00:10:08,207
meat, vegetables, minerals,
vitamins...

271
00:10:08,207 --> 00:10:09,508
Wonder where she is?

272
00:10:10,376 --> 00:10:12,544
Alcohol 23%.

273
00:10:15,581 --> 00:10:18,183
Alcohol 23%?!

274
00:10:19,051 --> 00:10:19,919
Oh!

275
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:20,786
Oh.

276
00:10:20,786 --> 00:10:22,087
Are you the young lady

277
00:10:22,087 --> 00:10:23,389
that's going to do the commercial?

278
00:10:23,389 --> 00:10:24,256
Yes, sir.

279
00:10:24,256 --> 00:10:25,557
Well, I'm Ross Elliot, the director.

280
00:10:25,557 --> 00:10:26,425
How do you do?
How do you do?

281
00:10:26,425 --> 00:10:28,594
I'm Lucille...
MacGillicuddy.

282
00:10:30,329 --> 00:10:32,064
Ricky sure knows how to pick them.

283
00:10:32,064 --> 00:10:33,365
Oh, thank you.

284
00:10:33,365 --> 00:10:34,233
You know your lines yet?

285
00:10:34,233 --> 00:10:35,534
Well, I think so.

286
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:37,269
Well, let's run through it.

287
00:10:37,269 --> 00:10:38,570
All right.

288
00:10:40,739 --> 00:10:42,474
Now, you stand right over here.

289
00:10:42,474 --> 00:10:43,342
Yes, sir.

290
00:10:43,776 --> 00:10:44,643
Now, let's try it once,

291
00:10:44,643 --> 00:10:46,378
and remember, be bright and
vivacious.

292
00:10:46,378 --> 00:10:47,680
Yes, sir.
All right.

293
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,848
Maury, will you stand by with the
script, please.

294
00:10:52,017 --> 00:10:53,319
All right.

295
00:10:55,487 --> 00:10:57,222
(clears throat)

296
00:10:57,222 --> 00:10:58,524
Hello, friends.

297
00:10:58,524 --> 00:11:00,693
I'm your Vitameatavegamin girl.

298
00:11:00,693 --> 00:11:03,295
Are you tired, run down, listless?

299
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:05,464
Do you poop out at parties?

300
00:11:07,199 --> 00:11:08,500
Are you unpopular?

301
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:10,669
The answer to all your problems

302
00:11:10,669 --> 00:11:12,404
is in this little bottle.

303
00:11:12,404 --> 00:11:14,139
Now you pick up the bottle.

304
00:11:14,139 --> 00:11:15,441
Oh.

305
00:11:15,441 --> 00:11:16,308
Little higher.

306
00:11:16,308 --> 00:11:17,609
That's right.

307
00:11:17,609 --> 00:11:19,345
The answer to all your problems

308
00:11:19,778 --> 00:11:22,815
is in this little bottle--
Vitameatavegamin.

309
00:11:22,815 --> 00:11:24,984
Vitameatavegamin contains

310
00:11:24,984 --> 00:11:28,454
vitamins, meat, vegetables and
minerals.

311
00:11:28,454 --> 00:11:30,189
Yes, with Vitameatavegamin

312
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:32,358
you can spoon your way to health.

313
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:35,394
All you do is take a tablespoonful
after every meal.

314
00:11:35,394 --> 00:11:36,695
Now you take some.

315
00:11:36,695 --> 00:11:37,563
Oh.

316
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:42,768
It's so tasty, too.

317
00:11:57,950 --> 00:12:00,119
It's... just like candy.

318
00:12:02,721 --> 00:12:03,589
No, no, no, no.

319
00:12:03,589 --> 00:12:05,758
Look, you're supposed to like the
stuff.

320
00:12:05,758 --> 00:12:07,493
You've got to smile, be happy.

321
00:12:07,493 --> 00:12:08,794
Now, try it again.

322
00:12:08,794 --> 00:12:10,529
Yes, sir.

323
00:12:14,867 --> 00:12:17,036
It's so tasty, too.

324
00:12:23,542 --> 00:12:24,843
It's just like candy.

325
00:12:26,578 --> 00:12:27,880
Nope, once more.

326
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:35,687
It's so tasty, too.

327
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:40,025
It's just like candy.

328
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:46,532
That's going to be fine.

329
00:12:46,532 --> 00:12:47,833
You just go ahead.

330
00:12:47,833 --> 00:12:49,568
Okay.

331
00:12:49,568 --> 00:12:50,869
So why don't you join

332
00:12:50,869 --> 00:12:53,038
the thousands of happy, peppy people

333
00:12:53,038 --> 00:12:54,773
and get a great big bottle

334
00:12:54,773 --> 00:12:56,942
of Vitameatavegamin tomorrow?

335
00:12:56,942 --> 00:12:58,677
That's Vita-meata-vegamin.

336
00:12:59,545 --> 00:13:00,846
Oh, that's fine, fine.

337
00:13:00,846 --> 00:13:02,581
Now you've got the feeling.

338
00:13:02,581 --> 00:13:03,882
Now I'd like to try it once more,

339
00:13:03,882 --> 00:13:06,051
only this time faster and brighter.

340
00:13:06,051 --> 00:13:07,786
LUCY: Faster and brighter.
Yes, sir.

341
00:13:07,786 --> 00:13:08,654
Hiya, Ross.

342
00:13:08,654 --> 00:13:09,521
Oh, hello, Ricky.

343
00:13:09,521 --> 00:13:10,823
Hiya, Lucy.

344
00:13:10,823 --> 00:13:12,558
I want to see how that...

345
00:13:13,425 --> 00:13:14,726
Hi.

346
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:16,895
And what, may I ask, are you doing
here?

347
00:13:16,895 --> 00:13:18,630
Well, she's going to do the
commercial.

348
00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:20,365
She's going to do the commercial?

349
00:13:20,365 --> 00:13:21,233
Yeah.

350
00:13:21,667 --> 00:13:22,534
What did you do

351
00:13:22,534 --> 00:13:25,571
to the girl that was supposed to be
here?

352
00:13:25,571 --> 00:13:26,872
Now, Lucy, I told you

353
00:13:26,872 --> 00:13:29,041
you couldn't do the commercial.

354
00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:30,776
Now, what's the big idea?

355
00:13:30,776 --> 00:13:32,945
Lucy, what have you got to say for
yourself?

356
00:13:32,945 --> 00:13:35,114
Hello, friends, I'm your
Vitameatavegamin girl.

357
00:13:35,114 --> 00:13:36,415
Are you tired, run down, listless?

358
00:13:36,415 --> 00:13:37,716
Never mind, never mind.

359
00:13:37,716 --> 00:13:39,451
Do you poop out at parties?

360
00:13:39,451 --> 00:13:40,319
Never mind that.

361
00:13:43,355 --> 00:13:45,090
Now, come on, you're going home.

362
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:47,259
Now, wait a minute, Ricky, it's too
late to get anybody else.

363
00:13:47,259 --> 00:13:48,560
Besides, she's pretty good.

364
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:49,862
Oh, sure, sure.

365
00:13:49,862 --> 00:13:51,597
No, I mean it, listen to her.

366
00:13:51,597 --> 00:13:53,765
You go ahead, Miss MacGillicuddy.

367
00:13:58,971 --> 00:14:02,007
Yeah, go ahead, Miss MacGillicuddy.

368
00:14:05,911 --> 00:14:08,514
Hello, friends, I'm your
Vitameatavegamin girl.

369
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:10,682
Are you tired, run down, listless?

370
00:14:10,682 --> 00:14:11,984
Do you poop out at parties?

371
00:14:11,984 --> 00:14:13,285
Are you unpopular?

372
00:14:13,285 --> 00:14:15,020
The answer to all your problems

373
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:17,623
is in this little bottle--
Vitameatavegamin.

374
00:14:17,623 --> 00:14:18,924

Yes, with Vitameatavegamin

377
00:14:22,828 --> 00:14:24,997
you can spoon your way to health.

378
00:14:24,997 --> 00:14:27,599
All you do is take a big
tablespoonful after every meal.

379
00:14:33,238 --> 00:14:35,407
It's so tasty, too.

380
00:14:35,407 --> 00:14:38,010
Tastes just like candy.

381
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:40,612
So why don't you join the thousands
of happy, peppy people

382
00:14:40,612 --> 00:14:41,914
and get a great big bottle

383
00:14:41,914 --> 00:14:43,215
of Vitameatavegamin tomorrow.

That's Vita-meata-vegamin.

385
00:14:46,685 --> 00:14:47,986
See what I mean?

386
00:14:49,288 --> 00:14:51,023
All right, you can do it tonight.

387
00:14:51,023 --> 00:14:54,059
But only because we're in a spot and
it's late, understand?

388
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:54,927
Yes, sir.

389
00:14:54,927 --> 00:14:55,794
(hiccup)

390
00:14:55,794 --> 00:14:57,095
Oh.

391
00:14:58,397 --> 00:14:59,698
Pardon me.

392
00:15:00,999 --> 00:15:02,734
You better be good, too.

393
00:15:02,734 --> 00:15:04,903
I'll go see about that number, Ross.

394
00:15:04,903 --> 00:15:06,205
Okay.

395
00:15:07,506 --> 00:15:09,241
Now, I'd like to do it once more,

396
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:10,976
this time from "it's so tasty, too."

397
00:15:10,976 --> 00:15:12,277
It's so tasty, too.

398
00:15:12,277 --> 00:15:13,579
That's right.
Yes, sir.

399
00:15:17,049 --> 00:15:19,218
It's so tasty, too.

400
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:23,121
Just like candy.

401
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:25,724
You know, this stuff tastes pretty
good

402
00:15:25,724 --> 00:15:27,025
once you get used to it.

403
00:15:28,327 --> 00:15:29,628
Yes, I know.

404
00:15:29,628 --> 00:15:30,062
Now, would you go ahead, please?

405
00:15:30,062 --> 00:15:31,797
"It's so tasty, too."

406
00:15:31,797 --> 00:15:32,664
Oh.

407
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:37,436
It's so tasty, too.

408
00:15:41,773 --> 00:15:42,641
So...

409
00:15:43,508 --> 00:15:45,677
So, uh...

410
00:15:45,677 --> 00:15:49,147
I don't know where to start unless I
begin at the beginning.

411
00:15:49,147 --> 00:15:51,316
All right, start at the beginning.

412
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:53,485
Oh, thank you.

413
00:15:53,485 --> 00:15:56,521
Hello, friends, I'm your

414
00:15:56,521 --> 00:15:58,690
Are you tired, run down, listless?

415
00:15:58,690 --> 00:16:00,425
Do you poop out at parties?

416
00:16:00,425 --> 00:16:01,293
Are you unpopular?

417
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:03,462
The answer to all your problems

418
00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:06,064

uh, little bottle.

00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:17,342

tablespoonful after every meal.

426
00:16:39,898 --> 00:16:42,067
It's so tasty, too.

427
00:16:42,067 --> 00:16:45,103
Tastes like candy... honest.

428
00:16:45,103 --> 00:16:46,838
(laughs)

429
00:16:53,779 --> 00:16:55,080
So why don't you join

430
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:57,683
the thousands of happy, peppy people

431
00:16:57,683 --> 00:17:00,719
and get a great big bottle of
Mitameatamigamin?

432
00:17:03,322 --> 00:17:05,924
Remember that name--

00:17:05,924 --> 00:17:08,527
Mitavatameatymat.

434
00:17:15,033 --> 00:17:16,768
Miss MacGillicuddy...

435
00:17:16,768 --> 00:17:17,636
Hmm?

436
00:17:18,070 --> 00:17:18,937
Are you feeling all right?

437
00:17:18,937 --> 00:17:22,407
Oh, I feel fine, but it's awful hot
in here.

438
00:17:22,407 --> 00:17:24,142
It must be the lights.

439
00:17:24,142 --> 00:17:25,444
Hey, Ross?
Yeah.

440
00:17:25,444 --> 00:17:28,046
The audio man wants to get a level on
her voice.

441
00:17:28,914 --> 00:17:30,649
Oh.

442
00:17:34,553 --> 00:17:36,288
Miss MacGillicuddy?

443
00:17:36,288 --> 00:17:37,589
Huh?

444
00:17:37,589 --> 00:17:38,890
Do you mind doing it

445
00:17:38,890 --> 00:17:40,625
just once more, please?

446
00:17:40,625 --> 00:17:43,228
Oh, no, sir, it would be perfectly
all right.

447
00:17:43,662 --> 00:17:45,397
Thank you. Okay in the control room?

448
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:47,566
MAN: Yeah, go ahead.

449
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:49,735

Are you tired, run down, listless?

457
00:18:20,966 --> 00:18:24,002
Do you pop out at parties?

458
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:30,942
Are you unpoopular?

459
00:18:33,545 --> 00:18:35,280
Well, are you?

460
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:42,654
The answer to all your problems is in
this little old bottle.

461
00:18:46,558 --> 00:18:48,727

So why don't you join

00:19:09,548 --> 00:19:12,150

00:19:21,693 --> 00:19:23,862
I tell you what you have to do.

471
00:19:23,862 --> 00:19:27,766
You have to take a whole
tablespoonful after every meal.

472
00:19:54,659 --> 00:19:56,828
It's so tasty, too.

473
00:20:05,504 --> 00:20:07,672
It's just like candy.

474
00:20:09,841 --> 00:20:13,311
So everybody get a bottle of...

475
00:20:13,311 --> 00:20:14,613
this stuff.

476
00:20:24,155 --> 00:20:25,457
Miss MacGillicuddy?

477
00:20:27,192 --> 00:20:28,493
Hmm?

478
00:20:28,493 --> 00:20:29,794
Are you all right?

479
00:20:30,228 --> 00:20:33,265
Oh, I feel fine, but you know, it's
hot in here.

480
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:37,602
Well, do you think

481
00:20:38,036 --> 00:20:40,205
you'll be able to go on with the
show?

482
00:20:40,205 --> 00:20:41,506
Well, do you?

483
00:20:41,506 --> 00:20:43,241
What?

484
00:20:44,109 --> 00:20:45,410
Joe!

485
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:48,013
I think you'd better take a little
rest until show time.

486
00:20:48,013 --> 00:20:50,615
LUCY: Yeah, boy, it sure is hot in
here.

487
00:20:50,615 --> 00:20:52,784
Joe, would you take Miss
MacGillicuddy

488
00:20:52,784 --> 00:20:54,085
to one of the dressing rooms

489
00:20:54,085 --> 00:20:55,820
and let her rest until show time?

490
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:57,122
Oh, sure.

491
00:20:57,122 --> 00:20:58,857
Come on, Miss MacGillicuddy.

492
00:20:58,857 --> 00:21:01,459
Joe, is it hot in here to you?

493
00:21:03,628 --> 00:21:05,797
Pardon me.

494
00:21:05,797 --> 00:21:07,098
Thank you.

495
00:21:07,098 --> 00:21:08,400
You're very nice.

496
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,569
You've been a perfect gememan.

497
00:21:10,569 --> 00:21:11,436
Come on, Joe.

498
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:17,075
Hey, Ross?
Yeah.

499
00:21:17,075 --> 00:21:19,244
Where's that girl that's supposed to
do the commercial?

500
00:21:19,244 --> 00:21:20,111
I can't find her.

501
00:21:20,111 --> 00:21:20,979
She's taking a nap in one of

502
00:21:20,979 --> 00:21:22,280
the dressing rooms No, she's not.

503
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:23,582
I looked in the dressing room.

504
00:21:23,582 --> 00:21:24,883
Well, find her, and get Ricky out
here.

505
00:21:24,883 --> 00:21:26,184
We're on the air in 15 seconds.

506
00:21:26,184 --> 00:21:29,220
Okay, stand by, everybody, 15
seconds!

507
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:30,956
Hey, Ricky, you're on!

508
00:21:30,956 --> 00:21:32,257
Ricky!
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

509
00:21:32,257 --> 00:21:33,124
Come on, 15 seconds.

510
00:21:33,124 --> 00:21:33,992
All right, all right.

511
00:21:33,992 --> 00:21:35,727
MAN: A little further back, Ricky.

512
00:21:35,727 --> 00:21:37,028
Further back, all right.

513
00:21:37,028 --> 00:21:38,763
Little more.
That's it.

514
00:21:38,763 --> 00:21:40,065
Stand by, everybody!

515
00:21:40,065 --> 00:21:43,535
(band plays fanfare)

516
00:21:43,535 --> 00:21:45,704
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen,

517
00:21:45,704 --> 00:21:48,306
and welcome to Your Saturday Night
Varieties.

518
00:21:48,306 --> 00:21:51,776
My name is Ricky Ricardo, I'm your
host for this evening.

519
00:21:51,776 --> 00:21:53,078
We have some wonderful acts,

520
00:21:53,078 --> 00:21:55,680
and I think we're all going to have a
lot of fun.

521
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:57,849
So, if we may, we'd like to start
things off

522
00:21:57,849 --> 00:21:58,717
with a little music.

523
00:21:58,717 --> 00:22:00,018
Mr. Hatch, if you please?

524
00:22:00,018 --> 00:22:03,922
(band plays introduction)

525
00:22:03,922 --> 00:22:06,091
Hey, hey, ole, ole, ole.

526
00:22:06,091 --> 00:22:07,826
Viva espana.

527
00:22:10,862 --> 00:22:22,140
(singing in Spanish)

528
00:23:00,745 --> 00:23:02,047
Hey, boys, let's go.

529
00:23:02,047 --> 00:23:11,156
(band continues playing)

530
00:23:12,457 --> 00:23:17,228
(Ricky resumes singing)

531
00:23:30,675 --> 00:23:32,844
Dire la capa con...

532
00:23:36,748 --> 00:23:40,218
Con gesto altivo...

533
00:23:41,519 --> 00:23:43,254
Y descubriendo...

534
00:23:43,254 --> 00:23:44,556
Hi, Fred.

535
00:23:44,556 --> 00:23:46,725
Hi, Ethel.

536
00:23:46,725 --> 00:23:49,094
Hi! Hi!

537
00:23:49,094 --> 00:23:50,195
Hello.

538
00:23:50,195 --> 00:23:52,797
Pisa morena...

539
00:23:52,797 --> 00:23:55,400
Morena.

540
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:57,135
Pisa con garbo...

541
00:23:57,135 --> 00:23:58,002
Con garbo...

542
00:23:58,002 --> 00:23:59,304
De voy a hacer...

543
00:23:59,304 --> 00:24:03,641
(singing nonsense, off-key)

544
00:24:03,641 --> 00:24:05,376
De mi capote...

545
00:24:05,376 --> 00:24:07,112
Y alla pisa...

546
00:24:07,545 --> 00:24:08,847
(singing nonsense)

547
00:24:10,148 --> 00:24:11,449
Ole, ole!

548
00:24:11,449 --> 00:24:13,618
Ole! Ole! Ole!

549
00:24:13,618 --> 00:24:14,486
Ole! Ole!

550
00:24:17,956 --> 00:24:19,257
Very funny.

551
00:24:19,257 --> 00:24:22,293
Hello, friends, I'm your
Vitaveatyvigyvat girl.

552
00:24:22,293 --> 00:24:25,764
Are you tired, run down and listless?

553
00:24:30,969 --> 00:24:35,306
Captioned by Media Access Group at
WGBH access.wgbh.org

554
00:24:40,945 --> 00:24:43,982
The part of the director was played
by Ross Elliot.

555
00:24:43,982 --> 00:24:46,584
Joe was played by Jerry Housner.

556
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:04,369
I Love Lucy is a Desilu production.


1
00:00:33,165 --> 00:00:38,804
Oh, boy, how can two people manage to
use so many dishes?

2
00:00:38,804 --> 00:00:40,539
What'll we do tonight, Ricky?

3
00:00:40,539 --> 00:00:41,840
Nothing.

4
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,141
What do you mean, nothing?

5
00:00:43,141 --> 00:00:45,310
Let's call the Mertzes and play some
cards.

6
00:00:45,310 --> 00:00:47,045
I don't feel like seeing the Mertzes

7
00:00:47,045 --> 00:00:48,347
and I don't want to play cards.

8
00:00:48,347 --> 00:00:50,082
What do you call what you're doing
here?

9
00:00:50,082 --> 00:00:52,250
Tiddledywinks.

10
00:00:53,986 --> 00:00:57,456
Play your black tiddledy on your red
wink.

11
00:01:00,058 --> 00:01:04,396
Look, this game is supposed to be
played by one person,

12
00:01:04,396 --> 00:01:06,999
hence the name solitaire.

13
00:01:06,999 --> 00:01:08,734
"Hence thee name solee-taire."

14
00:01:08,734 --> 00:01:10,902
You don't want to see the Mertzes,

15
00:01:10,902 --> 00:01:12,638
you don't want to play cards.

16
00:01:12,638 --> 00:01:15,674
I'll get you a gun, you can shoot
yourself.

17
00:01:15,674 --> 00:01:16,975
Thank you.

18
00:01:16,975 --> 00:01:19,578
What's the matter tonight, honey?

19
00:01:19,578 --> 00:01:21,313
Oh, I'm sorry, dear.

20
00:01:21,313 --> 00:01:23,048
I guess I'm just discouraged

21
00:01:23,048 --> 00:01:24,349
about my career.

22
00:01:24,349 --> 00:01:26,084
Your career? Why?

23
00:01:26,084 --> 00:01:29,121
Well, I don't seem to be getting
anyplace.

24
00:01:29,121 --> 00:01:30,856
I'm not exciting anymore.

25
00:01:30,856 --> 00:01:32,591
You are to me.

26
00:01:32,591 --> 00:01:33,458
I mean I'm not news.

27
00:01:33,458 --> 00:01:35,193
Can't get my name in the paper.

28
00:01:35,627 --> 00:01:36,928
Nobody's talking about me.

29
00:01:36,928 --> 00:01:38,230
Oh, they are, too.

30
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:39,531
I hear people talking about you

31
00:01:39,531 --> 00:01:41,266
all the time all over the place.

32
00:01:41,266 --> 00:01:42,567
Yeah, name one.

33
00:01:42,567 --> 00:01:45,170
Well, uh...
just the other morning

34
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:48,206
the milkman asked me how your cold
was.

35
00:01:49,508 --> 00:01:51,243
That's what I mean.

36
00:01:51,243 --> 00:01:54,279
The milkman wants to know how my cold
is.

37
00:01:54,279 --> 00:01:55,580
Big deal.

38
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:58,617
Well, what about your publicity
agent?

39
00:01:58,617 --> 00:01:59,918
That's a good question.

40
00:01:59,918 --> 00:02:01,653
I should give that 50 bucks a week

41
00:02:01,653 --> 00:02:04,256
to someone who can get my name in the
paper.

42
00:02:04,256 --> 00:02:06,425
50 bucks a week.

43
00:02:06,425 --> 00:02:08,593
Gee, would you give that job

44
00:02:08,593 --> 00:02:11,196
to anybody who's bright and energetic

45
00:02:11,196 --> 00:02:14,232
and has wonderful ideas about
publicity?

46
00:02:14,232 --> 00:02:15,534
Who?

47
00:02:15,534 --> 00:02:16,401
Well, would you?

48
00:02:16,401 --> 00:02:17,703
Well, who is it?

49
00:02:17,703 --> 00:02:19,438
If I don't get your name in the
paper,

50
00:02:19,438 --> 00:02:21,173
it won't cost you a cent.

51
00:02:22,474 --> 00:02:23,341
Oh, no.

52
00:02:23,341 --> 00:02:25,510
Oh, no, no, no, please, please don't!

53
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:27,245
Now, look, don't...
look, look,

54
00:02:27,245 --> 00:02:28,980
just forget the whole thing, will
you, please?

55
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:30,282
Now, just-just-just put publicity

56
00:02:30,282 --> 00:02:31,583
out of your mind altogether.

57
00:02:31,583 --> 00:02:32,884
Oh, come, now.

58
00:02:32,884 --> 00:02:34,186
Oh, my goodness.

59
00:02:34,186 --> 00:02:35,921
What a horrible thought.

60
00:02:35,921 --> 00:02:38,090
It isn't that bad.

61
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:39,825
Look, you want to help me really?

62
00:02:39,825 --> 00:02:40,692
Sure.
All right,

63
00:02:40,692 --> 00:02:42,861
just-just forget publicity
altogether.

64
00:02:42,861 --> 00:02:43,729
All right.

65
00:02:44,162 --> 00:02:45,464
Don't even tell people that you know
me.

66
00:02:45,464 --> 00:02:46,331
All right!

67
00:02:46,331 --> 00:02:46,765
All right.

68
00:02:47,199 --> 00:02:48,066
Okay.

69
00:02:48,066 --> 00:02:49,367
All right.
All right already.

70
00:02:58,477 --> 00:02:59,778
Good morning, Lucy.

71
00:02:59,778 --> 00:03:00,645
Hi.

72
00:03:00,645 --> 00:03:01,947
What are you doing?

73
00:03:01,947 --> 00:03:04,116
Figuring out the value of my jewelry.

74
00:03:04,116 --> 00:03:05,417
Insurance?

75
00:03:05,417 --> 00:03:07,152
No, publicity.
Ricky's worried

76
00:03:07,152 --> 00:03:09,321
because he hasn't been getting enough
publicity

77
00:03:09,321 --> 00:03:10,622
so I'm going to help him.

78
00:03:10,622 --> 00:03:11,923
You know how those Hollywood stars

79
00:03:11,923 --> 00:03:14,092
get their name in the paper when
their jewels are stolen.

80
00:03:14,092 --> 00:03:16,261
Hey, that's a wonderful idea.

81
00:03:16,261 --> 00:03:17,996
Yeah.
I can see the headline now.

82
00:03:17,996 --> 00:03:19,297
So can I.

83
00:03:19,297 --> 00:03:21,032
"Ricky Ricardo's wife robbed

84
00:03:21,032 --> 00:03:23,201
of priceless jewels valued at..."

85
00:03:23,201 --> 00:03:27,105
43 dollars.

86
00:03:27,105 --> 00:03:28,406
Some headline.

87
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,142
Yeah.

88
00:03:30,142 --> 00:03:34,045
Hey, how about letting Ricky win a
title like Miss America?

89
00:03:35,347 --> 00:03:37,949
He doesn't have the right
measurements.

90
00:03:37,949 --> 00:03:39,684
Oh, that's not what I meant.

91
00:03:39,684 --> 00:03:41,853
No, we need something like this.
Look.

92
00:03:41,853 --> 00:03:44,456
"The Shah of Persia has a standing
order

93
00:03:44,456 --> 00:03:46,625
for all of Benny Goodman's records."

94
00:03:46,625 --> 00:03:48,794
Well, you can do exactly the same
thing.

95
00:03:48,794 --> 00:03:50,095
How?

96
00:03:50,529 --> 00:03:52,264
Have Ricky order all of Benny
Goodman's records.

97
00:03:52,697 --> 00:03:53,565
Oh, Ethel!

98
00:03:53,565 --> 00:03:56,168
This item is good only because it
concerns royalty

99
00:03:56,168 --> 00:03:57,903
from a faraway country.

100
00:03:57,903 --> 00:03:59,638
That's what makes it exciting.

101
00:03:59,638 --> 00:04:00,939
Oh.

102
00:04:00,939 --> 00:04:03,542
If we just knew a countess or a
princess

103
00:04:03,542 --> 00:04:05,710
who couldn't live without "Babalu."

104
00:04:07,012 --> 00:04:08,747
You don't know any royalty, do you?

105
00:04:09,181 --> 00:04:11,783
My aunt was queen-for-a-day once.

106
00:04:13,518 --> 00:04:16,121
Well, we'll just have to dream
someone up.

107
00:04:16,121 --> 00:04:17,422
Let's see, now...

108
00:04:17,422 --> 00:04:18,723
we'll tell the papers

109
00:04:18,723 --> 00:04:20,892
that an exotic princess is coming

110
00:04:20,892 --> 00:04:22,194
from a faraway country,

111
00:04:22,194 --> 00:04:24,362
traveling halfway around the world

112
00:04:24,362 --> 00:04:26,531
just to hear Ricky Ricardo in person.

113
00:04:26,531 --> 00:04:28,266
Hey, that's sensational!

114
00:04:28,266 --> 00:04:30,869
Yeah, now what country will she be
from?

115
00:04:30,869 --> 00:04:33,038
Well, it can't be too well known.

116
00:04:33,038 --> 00:04:34,339
No.

117
00:04:34,339 --> 00:04:36,074
I know-- Franistan.

118
00:04:36,074 --> 00:04:36,942
Yeah...

119
00:04:36,942 --> 00:04:38,243
Franistan?

120
00:04:38,243 --> 00:04:39,544
I never heard of it.

121
00:04:39,544 --> 00:04:40,846
Neither did I.

122
00:04:40,846 --> 00:04:42,581
Princess Scheherazade

123
00:04:42,581 --> 00:04:45,617
daughter of the Maharajah of
Franistan.

124
00:04:45,617 --> 00:04:47,352
Oh, if she was the daughter of a
maharajah,

125
00:04:47,352 --> 00:04:49,087
they wouldn't call her a princess.

126
00:04:49,087 --> 00:04:49,955
What would they call her?

127
00:04:49,955 --> 00:04:51,256
A maharani.

128
00:04:51,256 --> 00:04:53,859
Oh, no, Ethel, that's a maharajah's
wife.

129
00:04:53,859 --> 00:04:55,160
Oh.

130
00:04:55,594 --> 00:04:57,762
I guess she'd be a "maharincess."

131
00:04:59,497 --> 00:05:00,799
"Maharincess."

132
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:01,666
Yeah.

133
00:05:01,666 --> 00:05:04,703
Scheherazade, Maharincess of
Franistan.

134
00:05:04,703 --> 00:05:06,438
Gee, that's wonderful.

135
00:05:06,438 --> 00:05:07,739
Yeah.

136
00:05:07,739 --> 00:05:10,342
Too bad she can't really come to
town.

137
00:05:10,342 --> 00:05:11,643
Yeah.

138
00:05:11,643 --> 00:05:14,246
Of course, that's impossible.

139
00:05:14,246 --> 00:05:15,547
Yeah?

140
00:05:16,848 --> 00:05:17,716
Lucy!

141
00:05:19,017 --> 00:05:20,752
Just call me Scheherazade.

142
00:05:20,752 --> 00:05:22,053
You wouldn't dare!

143
00:05:22,487 --> 00:05:23,355
I would, too.

144
00:05:23,355 --> 00:05:24,656
Will you help me?

145
00:05:24,656 --> 00:05:27,259
I'm yours to command, my maharincess.

146
00:05:27,259 --> 00:05:28,560
(cackles)

147
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,861
The papers will eat this up.

148
00:05:29,861 --> 00:05:31,596
Come on, we got a lot of work to do.

149
00:05:31,596 --> 00:05:32,898
Now, you look up the phone numbers

150
00:05:33,331 --> 00:05:34,633
of all the newspapers in town.

151
00:05:34,633 --> 00:05:36,801
All right.
I got the number of the Post here.

152
00:05:36,801 --> 00:05:39,404
And we have to make a reservation at
a fancy hotel.

153
00:05:39,404 --> 00:05:40,705
How about staying at the Waldorf?

154
00:05:41,139 --> 00:05:42,874
Swell.

155
00:05:42,874 --> 00:05:44,175
Hello.

156
00:05:44,175 --> 00:05:46,344
Hello, city editor, please.

157
00:05:46,344 --> 00:05:50,248
This is the overseas operator.

158
00:05:50,248 --> 00:05:51,983
Hello, editor?

159
00:05:51,983 --> 00:05:55,453
We have an overseas call from
Franistan.

160
00:05:55,453 --> 00:05:58,490
It's a maharani-to-person call.

161
00:05:59,357 --> 00:06:02,394
Go ahead, Franistan.

162
00:06:02,394 --> 00:06:06,298
(heavily accented): Hello, hello,
hello?

163
00:06:06,298 --> 00:06:10,201
Hello, this is the maharani of
Franistan.

164
00:06:10,201 --> 00:06:15,840
Please do not print in paper about my
daughter, Scheherazade.

165
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:19,311
The Maharincess, she come to America.

166
00:06:20,612 --> 00:06:23,214
Yes, she come to America

167
00:06:23,214 --> 00:06:27,552
and Maharajah very mad she come to
America

168
00:06:27,552 --> 00:06:31,022
just to see famous singer in person.

169
00:06:31,022 --> 00:06:34,492
He is famous band leader.

170
00:06:34,492 --> 00:06:37,095
Ricky Ricardo.

171
00:06:37,095 --> 00:06:39,264
Ricky Ricardo!

172
00:06:40,131 --> 00:06:41,866
(normally): Ricky Ricardo!

173
00:06:43,168 --> 00:06:46,638
R-i-c-k-y R...

174
00:06:46,638 --> 00:06:50,976
(nasally): Yeah, that's right, Ricky
Ricardo.

175
00:06:50,976 --> 00:06:52,277
Yes.

176
00:06:52,277 --> 00:06:55,747
Now, promise... promise you print
nothing in paper

177
00:06:55,747 --> 00:07:00,952
and you do not try to contact her at
Waldorf Astoria Hotel.

178
00:07:02,253 --> 00:07:04,856
Waldorf Astoria Hotel!

179
00:07:04,856 --> 00:07:07,025
Yeah, good-bye.

180
00:07:07,025 --> 00:07:07,892
Good-bye.

181
00:07:07,892 --> 00:07:09,627
(laughing): How'd I sound?

182
00:07:09,627 --> 00:07:10,929
Great.

183
00:07:10,929 --> 00:07:12,664
Give me the next number.

184
00:07:14,399 --> 00:07:16,568
Well, do you know when he'll be in?

185
00:07:16,568 --> 00:07:19,170
All right, look, as soon as he gets
there

186
00:07:19,170 --> 00:07:21,773
would you please tell him to call me?

187
00:07:21,773 --> 00:07:23,074
This is Ricky Ricardo.

188
00:07:23,074 --> 00:07:24,376
I'm down at the club.

189
00:07:24,376 --> 00:07:25,677
All right, good-bye.

190
00:07:25,677 --> 00:07:26,978
Hi, Rick.

191
00:07:26,978 --> 00:07:28,279
Hiya, Fred.

192
00:07:28,279 --> 00:07:30,015
Did you see the paper?

193
00:07:30,015 --> 00:07:31,316
Yeah, I saw the paper.

194
00:07:31,316 --> 00:07:33,051
Congratulations, old boy.

195
00:07:33,051 --> 00:07:34,352
Look at the size of this type.

196
00:07:34,352 --> 00:07:36,521
"Franistan royalty makes pilgrimage

197
00:07:36,521 --> 00:07:37,822
to see Cuban idol."

198
00:07:37,822 --> 00:07:39,124
I know, I know.

199
00:07:39,124 --> 00:07:40,425
"Maharajah's daughter claims

200
00:07:40,425 --> 00:07:42,160
Ricky Ricardo is real gone."

201
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,329
I've read it, Fred, I read it.

202
00:07:44,329 --> 00:07:46,064
Yeah, yeah, well, I'd...

203
00:07:46,064 --> 00:07:49,534
kind of think you'd be a little bit
more excited.

204
00:07:49,534 --> 00:07:51,269
Not every band leader

205
00:07:51,269 --> 00:07:53,872
can make a maharincess flip her
beanie.

206
00:07:53,872 --> 00:07:55,607
You don't mean to tell me

207
00:07:55,607 --> 00:07:57,342
you really believe that story, do
you?

208
00:07:57,342 --> 00:07:58,643
Well, it's in all the papers.

209
00:07:58,643 --> 00:08:00,378
Are you out of your head or
something?

210
00:08:00,378 --> 00:08:01,679
A member of royalty

211
00:08:01,679 --> 00:08:04,716
in some ridiculous place called
"Crafistan"

212
00:08:04,716 --> 00:08:07,318
or whatever the name of the joint
is--

213
00:08:07,318 --> 00:08:09,487
she gets ahold of one of my records,

214
00:08:09,487 --> 00:08:12,090
so she travels halfway around the
world

215
00:08:12,524 --> 00:08:13,825
just to hear me sing.

216
00:08:13,825 --> 00:08:16,861
Well, that's the phoniest story I've
ever heard in my life.

217
00:08:16,861 --> 00:08:18,163
Then where did it come from?

218
00:08:18,163 --> 00:08:19,464
My press agent, where else?

219
00:08:19,464 --> 00:08:21,633
I told that character I wanted some
publicity,

220
00:08:21,633 --> 00:08:22,500
but this is ridiculous.

221
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,669
I'll be laughed right out of the
business.

222
00:08:24,669 --> 00:08:25,970
Well, now that I think it over,

223
00:08:25,970 --> 00:08:27,272
it does sound pretty silly.

224
00:08:27,272 --> 00:08:28,573
Of course it's silly.

225
00:08:28,573 --> 00:08:31,176
Only an idiot will believe a story
like that.

226
00:08:31,176 --> 00:08:34,212
(phone rings)

227
00:08:34,212 --> 00:08:35,513
Hello.

228
00:08:35,513 --> 00:08:38,116
Kenny. Now, look, what is the matter
with you, Kenny?

229
00:08:38,116 --> 00:08:40,718
Are you trying to get me kicked out
of show business?

230
00:08:40,718 --> 00:08:42,887
You know what I'm talking about--

231
00:08:42,887 --> 00:08:44,189
the story in the paper, the story.

232
00:08:44,189 --> 00:08:47,659
Look, that is the most ridiculous,
the most stupid

233
00:08:47,659 --> 00:08:49,394
the silliest, phoniest...

234
00:08:49,394 --> 00:08:51,129
What?

235
00:08:51,129 --> 00:08:52,864
You didn't?

236
00:08:52,864 --> 00:08:55,900
Now, wait a minute, Clem.

237
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:58,503
You're not kidding me, are you?

238
00:08:58,503 --> 00:09:02,407
Well, I'm going to call the Waldorf
right away and find out.

239
00:09:02,407 --> 00:09:05,009
You did call the Waldorf.

240
00:09:05,009 --> 00:09:10,215
And the Maharincess of Franistan
registered there this morning?

241
00:09:10,215 --> 00:09:11,950
Holy cow.

242
00:09:14,119 --> 00:09:15,854
Huh...

243
00:09:15,854 --> 00:09:17,589
how about that?

244
00:09:19,324 --> 00:09:20,625
Okay.

245
00:09:20,625 --> 00:09:22,360
Talk to you later, kid.

246
00:09:27,565 --> 00:09:30,168
I guess it's true.

247
00:09:30,168 --> 00:09:31,469
Somebody around here just said

248
00:09:31,469 --> 00:09:34,506
only an idiot would fall for a story
like that.

249
00:09:34,506 --> 00:09:36,674
Now, wait a minute, Fred.

250
00:09:36,674 --> 00:09:39,711
Now, let's look at it this way--

251
00:09:39,711 --> 00:09:41,446
here's this poor girl

252
00:09:41,446 --> 00:09:45,350
sitting in her castle in faraway
Franistan,

253
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:48,386
she gets ahold of one of my records,

254
00:09:48,386 --> 00:09:51,422
she finds my voice irresistible

255
00:09:51,422 --> 00:09:54,025
and she falls madly in love.

256
00:09:54,025 --> 00:09:57,495
There's nothing farfetched about
that.

257
00:09:58,796 --> 00:10:01,833
Maybe I ought to go out and come in
again.

258
00:10:01,833 --> 00:10:04,435
Gee, I wonder if she speaks English.

259
00:10:04,435 --> 00:10:07,038
You know what they speak in
Franistan?

260
00:10:07,038 --> 00:10:08,773
I don't know, where is it?

261
00:10:10,942 --> 00:10:11,809
Where is it?

262
00:10:11,809 --> 00:10:13,111
Yeah.

263
00:10:13,111 --> 00:10:15,280
Oh, Fred, don't you know anything?

264
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:17,015
No, where is it?

265
00:10:17,015 --> 00:10:18,316
Franistan?

266
00:10:18,316 --> 00:10:19,617
Yeah.

267
00:10:19,617 --> 00:10:22,654
Well, it's right between
Czechoslovakia and...

268
00:10:22,654 --> 00:10:24,822
Below the border of Austria.

269
00:10:24,822 --> 00:10:26,558
Well, you know, it's stuck

270
00:10:26,558 --> 00:10:29,594
right in between Switzerland and
Persia--

271
00:10:29,594 --> 00:10:31,329
right in there someplace.

272
00:10:33,498 --> 00:10:34,365
Oh, there!

273
00:10:34,365 --> 00:10:35,667
Yeah, there-- Franistan.

274
00:10:35,667 --> 00:10:36,968
That's where it is, right there.

275
00:10:38,703 --> 00:10:40,438
How about that?

276
00:10:40,438 --> 00:10:44,776
Gee, I wonder what you do when you're
introduced to royalty?

277
00:10:44,776 --> 00:10:46,511
How about this, Fred--

278
00:10:46,511 --> 00:10:49,981
Your Highness, I am delighted to meet
you.

279
00:10:50,415 --> 00:10:53,451
(as woman): Oh, Mr. Ricardo, you send
me!

280
00:11:05,597 --> 00:11:07,765
Now, you're sure that Her Highness
said

281
00:11:07,765 --> 00:11:09,067
she'd be here at 3:00?

282
00:11:09,067 --> 00:11:10,802
Yes, her lady-in-waiting called me

283
00:11:10,802 --> 00:11:12,971
right after they checked into the
Waldorf,

284
00:11:12,971 --> 00:11:15,139
and she said she'd be here at 3:00.

285
00:11:15,139 --> 00:11:16,007
Hey, Ricky...

286
00:11:16,007 --> 00:11:17,308
hold it.

287
00:11:17,308 --> 00:11:18,176
Thanks.

288
00:11:18,176 --> 00:11:20,345
Are you going to put on a whole show
just for her?

289
00:11:20,345 --> 00:11:22,080
Yes, yes, it's a command performance,
you know.

290
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,381
We're going to do everything.

291
00:11:23,381 --> 00:11:25,550
Hey, Rick, I just called the house
again.

292
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:27,285
Lucy and Ethel must be out shopping.

293
00:11:27,285 --> 00:11:29,887
Oh, gee, that's too bad they have to
miss it.

294
00:11:29,887 --> 00:11:31,623
Yeah.
Uh, fellows...

295
00:11:31,623 --> 00:11:34,659
Now, please don't forget how we
rehearsed her entrance now.

296
00:11:34,659 --> 00:11:36,828
All right? We tuned up?

297
00:11:36,828 --> 00:11:38,129
Okay.

298
00:11:38,129 --> 00:11:38,997
Cigarette?

299
00:11:38,997 --> 00:11:40,732
Yeah, please, thank you.

300
00:11:42,033 --> 00:11:43,768
I guess you must be pretty nervous

301
00:11:43,768 --> 00:11:45,503
at meeting royalty like this, huh?

302
00:11:45,503 --> 00:11:46,804
Mm? Nervous?

303
00:11:46,804 --> 00:11:48,539
No, why should I be nervous

304
00:11:48,539 --> 00:11:49,841
about meeting royalty?

305
00:11:49,841 --> 00:11:51,142
I don't have to be...

306
00:11:51,142 --> 00:11:52,443
Hey, Rick, look.

307
00:11:52,443 --> 00:11:53,745
Here they come.

308
00:11:53,745 --> 00:11:55,913
All right, fellows, up, everybody up.

309
00:12:05,023 --> 00:12:08,926
(high voice): The Maharincess of
Franistan.

310
00:12:08,926 --> 00:12:12,830
(playing fanfare)

311
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,181
Your Highness.

312
00:12:39,290 --> 00:12:41,025
Welcome to the Tropicana.

313
00:12:41,025 --> 00:12:44,062
(spritzing perfume)

314
00:12:51,869 --> 00:12:52,737
Your Highness.

315
00:13:04,449 --> 00:13:05,750
Uh...

316
00:13:07,919 --> 00:13:09,220
Your Highness...

317
00:13:21,799 --> 00:13:24,402
Um... Your Highness, uh...

318
00:13:24,402 --> 00:13:27,438
did you have a nice trip over?

319
00:13:27,438 --> 00:13:29,173
(high-voiced): Yes.

320
00:13:30,908 --> 00:13:33,511
Um...

321
00:13:33,511 --> 00:13:38,282
Uh... are you... are you enjoying
your stay in America?

322
00:13:38,282 --> 00:13:40,017
Yes.

323
00:13:40,017 --> 00:13:41,753
Would Her Highness answer

324
00:13:41,753 --> 00:13:44,355
a few questions for the press?

325
00:13:44,355 --> 00:13:45,656
Yes.
Good.

326
00:13:45,656 --> 00:13:47,825
Your highness, is it true that
Ricky...

327
00:13:48,259 --> 00:13:50,428
(Ethel gasps)

328
00:13:50,428 --> 00:13:52,597
Uh-uh-uh.

329
00:13:52,597 --> 00:13:53,898
Oh.

330
00:13:55,633 --> 00:13:56,934
Your Highness, is it true

331
00:13:56,934 --> 00:13:59,971
that Ricky Ricardo is your favorite
vocalist?

332
00:14:00,405 --> 00:14:01,706
Yes.

333
00:14:01,706 --> 00:14:03,875
Do you like any other American
performers?

334
00:14:04,308 --> 00:14:05,176
No.

335
00:14:05,176 --> 00:14:06,477
Now, let me see if I have this
straight--

336
00:14:06,911 --> 00:14:08,212
you've never seen Ricky Ricardo in
person,

337
00:14:08,212 --> 00:14:09,947
you first heard his records two years
ago

338
00:14:09,947 --> 00:14:11,249
and you fell in love with his voice

339
00:14:11,249 --> 00:14:12,984
and decided to come to America to see
him.

340
00:14:12,984 --> 00:14:14,719
Your father didn't approve, but you
came anyway

341
00:14:14,719 --> 00:14:16,454
and you can hardly wait to hear him
sing.

342
00:14:16,454 --> 00:14:17,321
Is that right?

343
00:14:17,321 --> 00:14:24,262
Yes, no, yes, yes, yes, no and yes.

344
00:14:27,732 --> 00:14:29,033
I see.

345
00:14:29,033 --> 00:14:31,202
Now, about the political situation

346
00:14:31,202 --> 00:14:32,937
in Franistan-- do you...

347
00:14:32,937 --> 00:14:34,238
Please!

348
00:14:36,407 --> 00:14:38,142
No more questions.

349
00:14:39,877 --> 00:14:44,215
The Maharincess want you to sing.

350
00:14:44,215 --> 00:14:46,384
Oh, well...

351
00:14:46,384 --> 00:14:48,119
I'm deeply honored.

352
00:15:05,036 --> 00:15:14,579
(playing ballad intro)

353
00:15:15,012 --> 00:15:17,615
When we are dancing

354
00:15:17,615 --> 00:15:22,386
And you're dangerously near me

355
00:15:22,386 --> 00:15:25,423
I get ideas...

356
00:15:25,423 --> 00:15:27,592
(shrieks)

357
00:15:27,592 --> 00:15:29,327
Hold it, hold it.

358
00:15:39,303 --> 00:15:41,038
What's wrong, please?

359
00:15:41,472 --> 00:15:44,509
You sing, she swoon.

360
00:15:44,509 --> 00:15:46,677
Please go on.

361
00:15:46,677 --> 00:15:48,846
Well, if my singing makes her faint,

362
00:15:48,846 --> 00:15:50,147
maybe I'd better not.

363
00:15:50,147 --> 00:15:53,184
Please, I like it.

364
00:15:59,257 --> 00:16:02,293
(piano plays)

365
00:16:02,293 --> 00:16:04,462
When we are dancing

366
00:16:04,462 --> 00:16:09,233
And you're dangerously near me

367
00:16:09,233 --> 00:16:12,270
I get ideas

368
00:16:12,270 --> 00:16:14,005
I get ideas

369
00:16:14,438 --> 00:16:15,740
I want to hold you

370
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:18,776
So much closer than I dare to...

371
00:16:18,776 --> 00:16:20,945
(squeals)

372
00:16:27,885 --> 00:16:30,054
I want to scold you

373
00:16:30,054 --> 00:16:33,090
But I care more than I fear to

374
00:16:33,524 --> 00:16:35,259
And when you touch me

375
00:16:35,259 --> 00:16:37,862
I perspire in every finger...

376
00:16:37,862 --> 00:16:40,031
(screams)

377
00:16:50,875 --> 00:16:53,911
I get ideas

378
00:16:53,911 --> 00:16:56,514
I get ideas

379
00:16:56,514 --> 00:17:01,719
And after we have kissed good night
and still you linger

380
00:17:01,719 --> 00:17:07,358
I kind of think you get ideas, too.

381
00:17:07,792 --> 00:17:09,093
(wails)

382
00:17:14,298 --> 00:17:19,070
Though your eyes are always saying

383
00:17:19,070 --> 00:17:21,238
The things you're never saying

384
00:17:21,238 --> 00:17:23,407
I only hope they're saying

385
00:17:23,407 --> 00:17:28,179
That you could love me, too.

386
00:17:28,179 --> 00:17:29,480
(band stops)

387
00:17:32,083 --> 00:17:36,854
For that's the whole idea, it's true

388
00:17:36,854 --> 00:17:40,324
The lovely idea

389
00:17:40,324 --> 00:17:45,529
That I've fallen in love

390
00:17:45,529 --> 00:17:48,132
With...

391
00:17:48,566 --> 00:17:55,506
You.

392
00:17:55,506 --> 00:17:56,807
Oh.

393
00:17:56,807 --> 00:17:58,109
Encore, encore.

394
00:17:58,309 --> 00:17:59,410
Thank you.

395
00:17:59,410 --> 00:18:01,579
Really, would you like some more?

396
00:18:01,579 --> 00:18:02,446
Really.

397
00:18:02,446 --> 00:18:04,615
Oh, I see, uh...

398
00:18:04,615 --> 00:18:06,350
uh, Your Highness, I understand

399
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:10,254
that... your favorite number of ours
is... "Babalu."

400
00:18:10,254 --> 00:18:12,857
Oh! "Babalu"...

401
00:18:12,857 --> 00:18:15,026
"Babalu"!

402
00:18:15,893 --> 00:18:21,966
(drums start playing)

403
00:18:21,966 --> 00:18:24,568
(Ricky drums loudly)

404
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:37,148
(band starts)

405
00:18:37,148 --> 00:18:40,618
Babalu...

406
00:18:40,618 --> 00:18:43,220
Babalu...

407
00:18:48,426 --> 00:18:50,161
Well, Lucy, we'd better get out of
here.

408
00:18:50,161 --> 00:18:51,462
We've got to check out of this hotel

409
00:18:51,896 --> 00:18:53,197
and get home in time for dinner.

410
00:18:53,197 --> 00:18:55,800
Oh, but I'm so tired after that
performance

411
00:18:56,233 --> 00:18:57,968
at the club all afternoon.

412
00:18:57,968 --> 00:18:58,836
It was worth it.

413
00:18:59,270 --> 00:19:01,439
Think of all the publicity Ricky's
going to get.

414
00:19:01,439 --> 00:19:04,909
Yeah, but why did he have to sing so
many songs?

415
00:19:04,909 --> 00:19:08,813
25 numbers and every other one was
"Babalu."

416
00:19:10,114 --> 00:19:13,584
If I'd had to faint one more time,
I'd have fainted.

417
00:19:13,584 --> 00:19:14,885
Well, let's get out of here.

418
00:19:14,885 --> 00:19:16,187
Okay.

419
00:19:16,187 --> 00:19:17,054
(knock at door)

420
00:19:17,054 --> 00:19:18,789
Listen, if that's another reporter,

421
00:19:18,789 --> 00:19:20,091
don't let him in.

422
00:19:20,958 --> 00:19:21,826
Yes?

423
00:19:21,826 --> 00:19:23,127
Where is Her Highness?

424
00:19:23,127 --> 00:19:23,994
Hey, wait a minute.

425
00:19:23,994 --> 00:19:25,730
What do you want here?

426
00:19:25,730 --> 00:19:27,031
I want to...

427
00:19:28,766 --> 00:19:32,670
Your highness, you are in terrible
danger.

428
00:19:32,670 --> 00:19:35,706
Things are not going good in
Franistan.

429
00:19:35,706 --> 00:19:37,441
Franistan?

430
00:19:37,441 --> 00:19:40,044
Oh, wait a minute, now, who are you?

431
00:19:40,044 --> 00:19:45,249
Chief of Franistanian secret police,
Amjan Xanadu.

432
00:19:45,249 --> 00:19:49,153
Well, I'm Lucy Ricardo.

433
00:19:49,153 --> 00:19:52,189
You do not have to conceal your
identity from me.

434
00:19:52,189 --> 00:19:53,924
You bear the mark that is borne

435
00:19:53,924 --> 00:19:56,527
only by women of royal Franistan
family--

436
00:19:56,527 --> 00:19:58,696
red and black hair.

437
00:20:00,865 --> 00:20:03,033
Look, this is just a wig, see?

438
00:20:03,033 --> 00:20:05,636
Please believe me, you are in great
danger.

439
00:20:05,636 --> 00:20:07,805
The revolutionists are after you.

440
00:20:07,805 --> 00:20:08,672
Hey, he's serious.

441
00:20:09,106 --> 00:20:09,974
Good heavens, Ethel.

442
00:20:09,974 --> 00:20:13,010
Do you really think there is such a
place as Franistan?

443
00:20:13,010 --> 00:20:14,745
Hurry.
We have no time to lose!

444
00:20:14,745 --> 00:20:15,613
(knocking)

445
00:20:16,046 --> 00:20:17,348
Too late, they are here!

446
00:20:17,348 --> 00:20:18,649
Who's here?!
What do you mean?!

447
00:20:19,083 --> 00:20:20,384
Who's here?

448
00:20:20,384 --> 00:20:21,685
Huh?

449
00:20:21,685 --> 00:20:22,553
(Ethel screams)

450
00:20:22,553 --> 00:20:23,854
There she is.

451
00:20:23,854 --> 00:20:24,722
Get him!

452
00:20:24,722 --> 00:20:26,457
Ooh, what's the matter?

453
00:20:26,457 --> 00:20:28,626
(women screaming)

454
00:20:28,626 --> 00:20:30,795
(Xanadu cries out)

455
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,169
Farewell, Your Highness.

456
00:20:38,169 --> 00:20:44,241
Please tell Maharajah I have died for
my country.

457
00:20:44,241 --> 00:20:46,410
(women gasp)

458
00:20:46,410 --> 00:20:47,711
No...

459
00:20:47,711 --> 00:20:48,579
no...

460
00:20:49,013 --> 00:20:49,880
no!

461
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:52,483
(screams)

462
00:20:56,821 --> 00:20:58,556
We want royal secret.

463
00:20:58,556 --> 00:21:01,592
Look, fellows, you got me all wrong,
I...

464
00:21:01,592 --> 00:21:03,327
You have red and black hair

465
00:21:03,327 --> 00:21:04,628
of Franistan royalty.

466
00:21:04,628 --> 00:21:07,231
What is secret?

467
00:21:07,231 --> 00:21:09,834
All right, I'll give you the secret.

468
00:21:09,834 --> 00:21:11,135
It's every two weeks

469
00:21:11,135 --> 00:21:13,737
a cup of henna to a gallon of water.

470
00:21:15,472 --> 00:21:18,943
I'm not a maharincess, I'm a
henna-rinse-ess.

471
00:21:22,847 --> 00:21:25,883
She will talk when the tiger gets
here.

472
00:21:25,883 --> 00:21:27,184
The tiger?

473
00:21:27,184 --> 00:21:30,654
He knows all methods of oriental
torture.

474
00:21:30,654 --> 00:21:32,823
Water dripping on head.

475
00:21:32,823 --> 00:21:35,426
Death by a thousand cuts.

476
00:21:35,426 --> 00:21:36,727
Oh!

477
00:21:42,366 --> 00:21:43,667
Ow!

478
00:21:45,836 --> 00:21:48,873
The lingering death of the whips.

479
00:21:52,343 --> 00:21:53,644
The tiger knows them all.

480
00:21:54,078 --> 00:21:55,813
ETHEL: Well, so long, Lucy.

481
00:21:55,813 --> 00:21:57,114
Ethel, Ethel, where are you going?

482
00:21:57,114 --> 00:21:59,283
(Ethel shrieking)

483
00:21:59,283 --> 00:22:00,584
(pounding at door)

484
00:22:00,584 --> 00:22:01,886
The tiger!

485
00:22:01,886 --> 00:22:03,621
MAN: The tiger, the tiger.

486
00:22:04,922 --> 00:22:06,657
MEN: Hail, tiger.

487
00:22:06,657 --> 00:22:07,958
Hail, tiger.

488
00:22:07,958 --> 00:22:10,561
Hail, tiger.

489
00:22:10,561 --> 00:22:12,730
Hail, tiger.

490
00:22:12,730 --> 00:22:13,597
Hail, tiger!

491
00:22:13,597 --> 00:22:14,899
Hail, tiger.

492
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:18,369
Hail, tiger!

493
00:22:28,779 --> 00:22:30,080
Hail, tiger.

494
00:22:39,189 --> 00:22:40,925
Hail, tiger!

495
00:23:00,010 --> 00:23:01,745
Hail, tiger!

496
00:23:13,891 --> 00:23:18,228
(screaming)

497
00:23:18,228 --> 00:23:19,964
Ricky!

498
00:23:24,301 --> 00:23:26,036
Hi, Ethel.

499
00:23:26,036 --> 00:23:27,771
Fred Mertz!

500
00:23:27,771 --> 00:23:29,073
(laughing)

501
00:23:29,073 --> 00:23:31,675
Mr. Foster and Joe.

502
00:23:33,410 --> 00:23:35,579
What is this?!

503
00:23:35,579 --> 00:23:36,880
Well, "what is this?"

504
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,182
You're asking me, eh?

505
00:23:38,182 --> 00:23:39,483
When I found out

506
00:23:39,483 --> 00:23:42,086
that you were the Maharincess of
Franistan

507
00:23:42,086 --> 00:23:44,688
I decided to scare the life out of
you

508
00:23:44,688 --> 00:23:47,725
so you wouldn't try a fool thing like
that again.

509
00:23:47,725 --> 00:23:50,327
Oh, well, how did you find out?

510
00:23:50,327 --> 00:23:51,628
How did I find out...
who else but you

511
00:23:51,628 --> 00:23:53,797
would listen to me sing 25 songs

512
00:23:53,797 --> 00:23:55,099
and ask for more?

513
00:23:57,267 --> 00:23:59,436
Well, I don't think it was very
funny.

514
00:23:59,436 --> 00:24:02,039
You ought to be ashamed of
yourselves.

515
00:24:02,039 --> 00:24:03,774
You scared us half to death.

516
00:24:03,774 --> 00:24:05,509
Oh, Ethel, were you scared?

517
00:24:05,509 --> 00:24:07,244
I knew it was Ricky and Fred all the
time.

518
00:24:07,244 --> 00:24:08,545
It didn't bother m...

519
00:24:08,545 --> 00:24:09,847
(moans)

520
00:24:17,654 --> 00:24:21,558
Captioned by Media Access Group at
WGBH access.wgbh.org

521
00:24:26,330 --> 00:24:28,932

by Peter Leeds.

522
00:24:28,932 --> 00:24:31,101
The photographer was played by
Bennett Green.

523
00:24:31,535 --> 00:24:34,571

Reeves and Gil Herman.

(theme music playing)

00:00:22,822 --> 00:00:25,825
(theme music ending)

3
00:00:33,566 --> 00:00:34,567
Hi!

4
00:00:35,068 --> 00:00:36,069
Oh, hi.

5
00:00:36,069 --> 00:00:37,070
Hi.

6
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:38,571
FRED: Hi, kids.

7
00:01:05,598 --> 00:01:08,101
Well, what do we watch?

8
00:01:08,101 --> 00:01:11,104
Comedy? Drama? Soap opera?

9
00:01:11,104 --> 00:01:12,605
I don't care.

10
00:01:12,605 --> 00:01:15,108
Anything but wrestling.

11
00:01:15,108 --> 00:01:16,609
Ricky, wait a minute

12
00:01:16,609 --> 00:01:19,112
let's not watch television tonight.

13
00:01:19,112 --> 00:01:23,116
ALL: Not watch television?!

14
00:01:23,116 --> 00:01:25,118
What else is there to do?

15
00:01:25,118 --> 00:01:28,621
Well, whatever happened to that game
we used to play

16
00:01:28,621 --> 00:01:30,623
before television was invented?

17
00:01:30,623 --> 00:01:32,625
It was called conversation.

18
00:01:32,625 --> 00:01:35,128
Oh, yeah, how did that go?

19
00:01:35,128 --> 00:01:36,629
You know, the four of us

20
00:01:36,629 --> 00:01:39,132
used to just sit around all evening
and talk.

21
00:01:39,132 --> 00:01:40,633
Nothing so unusual about it.

22
00:01:41,134 --> 00:01:42,135
In millions of homes all over the
country

23
00:01:42,635 --> 00:01:43,636
other people were having

24
00:01:43,636 --> 00:01:46,139
the same kind of conversations we
were having.

25
00:01:46,139 --> 00:01:48,641
Yeah, that's why television was
invented.

26
00:01:50,643 --> 00:01:52,645
Go on, Rick, turn it on, will you?

27
00:01:53,146 --> 00:01:54,647
Now, wait a minute, Fred.

28
00:01:54,647 --> 00:01:56,649
Maybe Lucy's got something there.

29
00:01:56,649 --> 00:02:00,153
Yeah, we're four intelligent,
interesting people.

30
00:02:00,153 --> 00:02:02,155
Let's just talk-- exchange ideas.

31
00:02:02,655 --> 00:02:03,656
Okay.

32
00:02:03,656 --> 00:02:05,158
All right.

33
00:02:05,158 --> 00:02:06,659
Well, what do we talk about?

34
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,161
Anything.

35
00:02:08,161 --> 00:02:09,162
Just let the conversation flow.

36
00:02:09,662 --> 00:02:10,663
Let it go where it wants to.

37
00:02:10,663 --> 00:02:12,665
All right.

38
00:02:13,166 --> 00:02:15,168
Okay, let's start.

39
00:02:35,688 --> 00:02:37,690
Well, come on, let's talk.

40
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:48,201
Um... how about those elections?

41
00:02:48,201 --> 00:02:50,703
They were really something, huh?

42
00:02:51,704 --> 00:02:52,705
I guess so.

43
00:02:52,705 --> 00:02:53,706
Elections?

44
00:02:54,207 --> 00:02:56,209
Yeah, yeah, I...
what about them?

45
00:03:01,214 --> 00:03:03,716
Well, they had them, all right.

46
00:03:05,218 --> 00:03:06,719
Oh.

47
00:03:08,721 --> 00:03:10,223
Oh, come now

48
00:03:10,223 --> 00:03:12,725
someone must know something to say.

49
00:03:14,727 --> 00:03:15,728
Oh...

50
00:03:16,229 --> 00:03:18,731
What do we watch?

51
00:03:18,731 --> 00:03:20,233
Let's see what's on, eh?

52
00:03:20,733 --> 00:03:22,235
Okay.

53
00:03:24,237 --> 00:03:25,738
Hey, hey, that's good.

54
00:03:25,738 --> 00:03:27,740
Oh, it's a movie.

55
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:33,246
(film music playing)

56
00:03:39,252 --> 00:03:42,255
That's a pretty new movie for
television.

57
00:03:42,255 --> 00:03:43,756
New?

58
00:03:43,756 --> 00:03:47,260
Yeah, that little girl is Margaret
O'Brien, isn't it?

59
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:51,264
Look again-- it's Shirley Temple.

60
00:03:52,765 --> 00:03:54,767
Look again-- it's Mary Pickford.

61
00:04:02,775 --> 00:04:04,777
Hey, that's not tuned in right.

62
00:04:05,278 --> 00:04:06,779
I'll get it lighter.

63
00:04:08,281 --> 00:04:09,282
There.

64
00:04:12,785 --> 00:04:14,787
Oh, honey, that's too light.

65
00:04:15,288 --> 00:04:16,789
But don't make it too dark now.

66
00:04:16,789 --> 00:04:19,292
Well, if it's too light, it hurts my
eyes.

67
00:04:19,292 --> 00:04:20,793
Well, compromise.

68
00:04:20,793 --> 00:04:21,794
All right, how's that?

69
00:04:22,295 --> 00:04:23,796
All right, that's good now.

70
00:04:23,796 --> 00:04:25,298
Fine.
That's good.

71
00:04:26,799 --> 00:04:29,802
What are those lines across there?

72
00:04:32,305 --> 00:04:33,806
There's too much contrast.

73
00:04:33,806 --> 00:04:35,308
I'll fix it.

74
00:04:40,813 --> 00:04:42,315
There... how does it look now?

75
00:04:42,315 --> 00:04:46,319
Well, I can see the lines much
better.

76
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:49,822
Well, let's try it this way.

77
00:04:49,822 --> 00:04:51,824
There, the lines are fading.

78
00:04:51,824 --> 00:04:53,326
Yeah, the lines are gone.

79
00:04:53,326 --> 00:04:55,828
So is the picture.

80
00:04:56,829 --> 00:04:59,332
Well, wait a minute, will you?

81
00:04:59,332 --> 00:05:00,833
Okay, okay.

82
00:05:00,833 --> 00:05:01,834
All right, leave it!

83
00:05:01,834 --> 00:05:03,836
Leave it alone, leave it alone!

84
00:05:03,836 --> 00:05:06,339
Sit down, will you?
That's fine now!

85
00:05:06,339 --> 00:05:07,840
Sit down.

86
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:18,851
You think that's in focus?

87
00:05:19,352 --> 00:05:20,353
What?

88
00:05:20,353 --> 00:05:22,855
You think the picture is sharp
enough?

89
00:05:22,855 --> 00:05:23,856
Yeah.

90
00:05:23,856 --> 00:05:24,857
It's all right.

91
00:05:24,857 --> 00:05:25,858
Ah, I can get it

92
00:05:26,359 --> 00:05:27,860
much sharper than that.

93
00:05:31,364 --> 00:05:33,366
There, that's what I call in focus.

94
00:05:33,866 --> 00:05:35,368
Honey, that's too light.

95
00:05:35,868 --> 00:05:36,869
All right.

96
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:40,373
Uh-oh, that's too dark.

97
00:05:40,373 --> 00:05:42,375
Can't you get rid of those lines?

98
00:05:44,377 --> 00:05:46,879
Ricky, why couldn't you have left it
alone?

99
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:47,880
It was fine for all of us.

100
00:05:48,381 --> 00:05:49,382
Well, I'll get it, honey, I'll get
it.

101
00:05:49,382 --> 00:05:50,383
Now, listen, let me do it.

102
00:05:50,383 --> 00:05:51,384
Honey, I know how to do it.

103
00:05:51,384 --> 00:05:52,385
I've had it...

104
00:05:52,385 --> 00:05:53,386
Honey, please, I know...

105
00:05:53,386 --> 00:05:54,387
Oh!

106
00:05:54,387 --> 00:05:56,389
Now see what you've done!

107
00:05:56,389 --> 00:05:57,390
Me?!

108
00:05:57,390 --> 00:06:00,393
Well, that's the end of television
for tonight.

109
00:06:00,393 --> 00:06:01,394
Good, I'm glad.

110
00:06:01,394 --> 00:06:02,895
Now what are we going to do?

111
00:06:02,895 --> 00:06:04,897
Well, we could try conversation again

112
00:06:04,897 --> 00:06:06,899
but personally I'm all worn out

113
00:06:06,899 --> 00:06:09,402
from the last gabfest.

114
00:06:09,402 --> 00:06:13,406
We could make fudge and dress up in
our mothers' clothes.

115
00:06:13,406 --> 00:06:15,408
Yeah, that's the best idea yet.

116
00:06:16,409 --> 00:06:17,410
Oh, wait a minute.

117
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:19,912
My goodness!

118
00:06:23,916 --> 00:06:24,917
Look!

119
00:06:24,917 --> 00:06:27,420
A radio!

120
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:29,922
Well, what do you know?

121
00:06:34,927 --> 00:06:37,430
It takes a little time to warm up.

122
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:48,941
Well, what are we staring at?

123
00:06:48,941 --> 00:06:50,943
This is a radio.

124
00:06:51,944 --> 00:06:53,446
ANNOUNCER: Testing, testing...

125
00:06:53,446 --> 00:06:57,450
Mr. and Mrs. Eric Findley, meet
Freddy Fillmore.

126
00:06:57,450 --> 00:06:58,451
Oh, I remember this show--

127
00:06:58,951 --> 00:07:00,453
Freddy Fillmore, Mr. and Mrs. Quiz.

128
00:07:00,453 --> 00:07:02,955
How do you do, Mr. and Mrs. Findley?

129
00:07:02,955 --> 00:07:04,957
Now, here are your three $100
questions.

130
00:07:04,957 --> 00:07:07,960
First, who was the youngest man to be
inaugurated

131
00:07:08,461 --> 00:07:10,463
president of the United States?

132
00:07:11,464 --> 00:07:12,965
Theodore Roosevelt.

133
00:07:12,965 --> 00:07:13,966
Theodore Roosevelt?

134
00:07:13,966 --> 00:07:16,469
Oh, no, it was one of the earlier
ones--

135
00:07:16,469 --> 00:07:17,970
Adams or McKinley, wasn't it, Ethel?

136
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:20,473
Ask Fred, he was probably there.

137
00:07:24,477 --> 00:07:25,978
(bell rings)

138
00:07:25,978 --> 00:07:27,980
Oh, time's up, I'm so sorry.

139
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:30,483
The youngest president was 42 years
old

140
00:07:30,983 --> 00:07:32,485
the day of his inauguration

141
00:07:32,985 --> 00:07:34,987
and his name was Theodore Roosevelt.

142
00:07:35,488 --> 00:07:37,490
LUCY: Well!

143
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:38,991
What do you know about that?

144
00:07:39,492 --> 00:07:41,994
You were right-- how did you know
that?

145
00:07:41,994 --> 00:07:43,496
Doesn't everybody?

146
00:07:43,496 --> 00:07:44,997
"Doesn't everybody?"

147
00:07:44,997 --> 00:07:46,499
Oh-ho-ho!

148
00:07:46,499 --> 00:07:49,502
Now, Mr. and Mrs. Findley, here's
your second question

149
00:07:50,002 --> 00:07:52,505
and remember, only one answer between
you:

150
00:07:52,505 --> 00:07:55,508
What was the last state to be
admitted to the union?

151
00:07:55,508 --> 00:07:58,010
LUCY: I know what that was-- uh,
Nebraska, Nebraska.

152
00:07:58,010 --> 00:07:59,512
No, it was New Mexico.

153
00:07:59,512 --> 00:08:00,513
FRED: Wyoming.

154
00:08:01,013 --> 00:08:02,014
It was Arizona.

155
00:08:02,014 --> 00:08:03,516
Arizona?

156
00:08:04,016 --> 00:08:06,018
MR. FINDLEY: Er, was it Arizona?

157
00:08:06,018 --> 00:08:08,020
FILLMORE: You are so right!

158
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:12,024
The last state to be admitted to the
union was Arizona!

159
00:08:12,024 --> 00:08:14,527
And you now have $100!

160
00:08:14,527 --> 00:08:16,529
(chortling)

161
00:08:19,031 --> 00:08:21,534
Now for your third question:

162
00:08:21,534 --> 00:08:25,538
What was the date of Lincoln's
Gettysburg Address?

163
00:08:26,038 --> 00:08:27,540
Well, brain?

164
00:08:29,041 --> 00:08:32,044
November 19...

165
00:08:32,044 --> 00:08:34,547
1863.

166
00:08:34,547 --> 00:08:37,049
Come on, now, Mr. Findley, take a
guess.

167
00:08:37,049 --> 00:08:38,551
Mrs. Findley?

168
00:08:38,551 --> 00:08:39,552
(bell rings)

169
00:08:40,052 --> 00:08:42,054
Sorry, but your time is up.

170
00:08:42,054 --> 00:08:45,057
The answer is November 9, 1863.

171
00:08:45,057 --> 00:08:46,058
Ha!

172
00:08:49,562 --> 00:08:52,565
Oh! Oh, oh, I beg your pardon, I read
that wrong.

173
00:08:52,565 --> 00:08:57,069
The answer is November 19, 1863.

174
00:08:58,070 --> 00:08:59,071
Ha!

175
00:09:01,073 --> 00:09:05,578
That's too bad, Mr. and Mrs.
Findley, but you do have $100

176
00:09:05,578 --> 00:09:09,081
and a chance at our $500 jackpot
question.

177
00:09:09,081 --> 00:09:11,083
Oh, wait a minute, we don't have
enough time left

178
00:09:11,584 --> 00:09:13,586
so we'll just have to ask you the
jackpot question

179
00:09:13,586 --> 00:09:15,588
at the beginning of our next program.

180
00:09:15,588 --> 00:09:16,589
We're a little late, folks

181
00:09:17,089 --> 00:09:18,591
so this is Freddy Fillmore saying
good night

182
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:20,092
and remember to tune in every Monday,
Wednesday, and Friday...

183
00:09:20,092 --> 00:09:21,594
I'm very surprised at you.

184
00:09:21,594 --> 00:09:23,095
How did you happen to know

185
00:09:23,095 --> 00:09:24,597
the answer to those questions?

186
00:09:24,597 --> 00:09:29,101
Well, who do you think you're married
to, a country pumpkin?

187
00:09:33,105 --> 00:09:36,609
We studied American history in Cuba
too, you know.

188
00:09:36,609 --> 00:09:39,612
Well, you're certainly a lot smarter
than I am.

189
00:09:39,612 --> 00:09:41,614
I got all I can do to remember

190
00:09:41,614 --> 00:09:44,116
that there are 46 states.

191
00:09:46,118 --> 00:09:47,119
Forty-eight.

192
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:48,621
Oh, yeah...

193
00:09:48,621 --> 00:09:51,123
I guess I forgot Alaska and Hawaii.

194
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:53,626
Yeah.

195
00:09:54,627 --> 00:09:56,128
Hey, honey

196
00:09:56,128 --> 00:09:57,630
will you fix us some sandwiches?

197
00:09:58,130 --> 00:09:59,131
Sandwiches?

198
00:09:59,131 --> 00:10:01,634
Yeah, sandwiches-- two pieces of
bread

199
00:10:01,634 --> 00:10:05,137
with a thing in the middle and the
mustard on the top.

200
00:10:05,137 --> 00:10:07,640
Oh, eat, eat, eat, all they want
to...

201
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:10,142
Come on, Ethel, help me.

202
00:10:10,142 --> 00:10:11,644
Hey, you sure fooled me, Rick.

203
00:10:11,644 --> 00:10:15,147
I'd have bet you couldn't answer
those questions.

204
00:10:16,148 --> 00:10:17,650
I got something to tell you about
that, old man.

205
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:19,151
What?

206
00:10:19,151 --> 00:10:21,153
That's why I send them out of the
room.

207
00:10:21,654 --> 00:10:24,156
You know, that program was a delayed
broadcast.

208
00:10:24,657 --> 00:10:25,658
Yeah?

209
00:10:25,658 --> 00:10:27,660
Yeah, they made it this afternoon

210
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:30,162
and I was at the station when they
were doing it.

211
00:10:30,162 --> 00:10:31,664
I heard the whole thing.

212
00:10:31,664 --> 00:10:34,667
Then you knew the answers before they
asked them.

213
00:10:34,667 --> 00:10:35,668
Shh!

214
00:10:35,668 --> 00:10:37,169
Yeah.

215
00:10:37,169 --> 00:10:38,671
(chuckles)

216
00:10:38,671 --> 00:10:41,173
Boy, you...
you tricky Cuban.

217
00:10:50,683 --> 00:10:52,184
ETHEL: Woo-hoo!

218
00:10:52,184 --> 00:10:53,185
Woo-hoo.

219
00:10:53,185 --> 00:10:55,187
What are you doing?

220
00:10:55,187 --> 00:10:57,189
I thought we were going shopping.

221
00:10:57,189 --> 00:10:59,191
Oh, I guess I was just daydreaming

222
00:10:59,191 --> 00:11:01,193
about Ricky knowing the answers

223
00:11:01,193 --> 00:11:03,195
to all those questions last night.

224
00:11:03,195 --> 00:11:05,197
Just think, he would have won $300--

225
00:11:05,197 --> 00:11:07,700
$100 for each question.

226
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:09,201
Gosh.

227
00:11:09,201 --> 00:11:12,705
Three crisp, new, green $100 bills.

228
00:11:12,705 --> 00:11:14,206
Is that the way you see it?

229
00:11:14,206 --> 00:11:15,207
Uh-huh.

230
00:11:15,207 --> 00:11:17,209
I see it all in pennies

231
00:11:17,209 --> 00:11:19,712
and I'm running barefoot through it.

232
00:11:21,714 --> 00:11:23,716
Oh, well, we might as well stop
dreaming.

233
00:11:23,716 --> 00:11:26,218
Wait a minute, why do we have to
dream?

234
00:11:26,218 --> 00:11:28,220
Why can't he go on that program

235
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:29,722
and win all the money?

236
00:11:29,722 --> 00:11:30,723
Sure. Do you think he'd do it?

237
00:11:31,223 --> 00:11:32,224
Why not? He knows all the answers.

238
00:11:32,725 --> 00:11:33,726
Besides, it'd give him a chance

239
00:11:33,726 --> 00:11:34,727
to show off, the big ham.

240
00:11:34,727 --> 00:11:36,228
I'm going to call

241
00:11:36,228 --> 00:11:37,730
the station right now.

242
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:39,231
Hey, you might win that $500 jackpot

243
00:11:39,231 --> 00:11:40,700
then you'd really be rich.

244
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,201
Yeah, I'd have golden eggs

245
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:43,703
all over the house.

246
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:44,704
Huh?

247
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:46,205
I didn't realize

248
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:48,708
what kind of a goose I was married
to.

249
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:50,209
Freddy Fillmore, please.

250
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:51,210
Say, wait a minute.

251
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:53,212
It's a Mr. and Mrs. Quiz show.

252
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:54,714
You'll have to go on it, too.

253
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:56,215
So what? Ricky will answer all the
questions.

254
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:57,717
I'll just stand there, keep my mouth
shut.

255
00:11:57,717 --> 00:11:59,218
Uh, Freddy Fillmore?

256
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:01,721
Mr. Fillmore, this is Mrs. Ricky
Ricardo.

257
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:05,224
Mr. Fillmore, I don't know if you
know it or not

258
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:07,727
but my husband is one of the smartest
men

259
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:09,228
in the United States.

260
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:11,230
Yes, sir.

261
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:13,733
Yes, sir, and if you play your cards
right

262
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:16,736
you might be able to get him on your
program.

263
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:19,238
Uh-huh... that's right.

264
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:22,241
Well, I'm sure he'd be glad to.

265
00:12:32,034 --> 00:12:33,536
Hi, honey.

266
00:12:33,536 --> 00:12:36,539
Oh, Ricky, am I glad you're home in
time.

267
00:12:37,039 --> 00:12:38,040
Time for what?

268
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:40,042
I have a big surprise for you.

269
00:12:40,042 --> 00:12:41,043
Really? What is it?

270
00:12:41,043 --> 00:12:42,044
I won't tell you until 7:00.

271
00:12:42,545 --> 00:12:43,546
Oh?

272
00:12:43,546 --> 00:12:45,548
I was so proud of you last night

273
00:12:45,548 --> 00:12:48,050
knowing the answers to all those
questions.

274
00:12:48,551 --> 00:12:50,052
Well, honey, I have something

275
00:12:50,553 --> 00:12:52,054
to tell you about that, too.

276
00:12:52,555 --> 00:12:54,557
Wait a minute-- it's 7:00.

277
00:12:54,557 --> 00:12:56,058
Now, what is it?

278
00:12:56,058 --> 00:12:58,060
Well, you see, that program that we
heard last night

279
00:12:58,060 --> 00:12:59,562
was a delayed broadcast

280
00:12:59,562 --> 00:13:01,564
and I was down at the station

281
00:13:01,564 --> 00:13:02,565
when they were doing it

282
00:13:03,065 --> 00:13:05,067
and that's the reason that I knew all
the answers.

283
00:13:11,073 --> 00:13:13,075
What's the matter, honey?

284
00:13:13,075 --> 00:13:15,077
...Xyza, Ricky Ricardo.

285
00:13:15,077 --> 00:13:17,079
Yes, be sure to tune in for

286
00:13:17,079 --> 00:13:19,081
the Mr. and Mrs. Quiz program
tomorrow night

287
00:13:19,081 --> 00:13:22,084
when Freddy Fillmore's special guests
will be

288
00:13:22,084 --> 00:13:23,586
Mr. and Mrs. Ricky Ricardo.

289
00:13:23,586 --> 00:13:25,588
Oh, no.

290
00:13:29,592 --> 00:13:31,594
Lucy...

291
00:13:32,094 --> 00:13:33,596
before I kill you...

292
00:13:34,597 --> 00:13:36,098
would you mind telling me the
details?

293
00:13:36,098 --> 00:13:37,600
Well, you were so smart last night

294
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:38,601
and you knew all the answers

295
00:13:38,601 --> 00:13:41,103
and I thought you were a cinch to win
all the money

296
00:13:41,103 --> 00:13:42,104
so I called the radio station...

297
00:13:42,605 --> 00:13:44,106
And why did you call the radio
station

298
00:13:44,106 --> 00:13:45,107
without asking me first?

299
00:13:45,107 --> 00:13:47,610
Well, how did I know that you were
faking?

300
00:13:47,610 --> 00:13:51,113
I thought you were an overgrown Cuban
quiz kid.

301
00:13:53,115 --> 00:13:55,117
Look, all I know is

302
00:13:55,618 --> 00:13:58,120
that Columbus discover Ohio in 1776.

303
00:14:00,122 --> 00:14:03,626
Oh, fine. Well, what are we going to
do now?

304
00:14:03,626 --> 00:14:04,627
What are we going to do now?

305
00:14:05,127 --> 00:14:06,629
We'll have to go through with it.

306
00:14:06,629 --> 00:14:08,130
It's been announced on the air.

307
00:14:08,130 --> 00:14:09,131
I can't back out now.

308
00:14:09,131 --> 00:14:10,132
But you know something?

309
00:14:10,132 --> 00:14:11,133
What?

310
00:14:11,634 --> 00:14:14,136
Tomorrow night, when we get on that
show

311
00:14:14,136 --> 00:14:16,639
you better know the answers.

312
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:20,142
What are you going to do if I don't?

313
00:14:20,142 --> 00:14:23,145
It's too horrible to think about.

314
00:14:24,146 --> 00:14:26,148
Eew!

315
00:14:26,649 --> 00:14:28,651
Eew!

316
00:14:48,287 --> 00:14:50,289
Hi, Mr. Fillmore.

317
00:14:50,289 --> 00:14:52,291
Here are the questions for tonight.

318
00:14:52,291 --> 00:14:53,792
Oh, good, Tommy.

319
00:14:56,795 --> 00:14:58,797
Well, these ought to be hard enough.

320
00:14:58,797 --> 00:15:01,800
Let's see if you can answer any of
these, Tommy.

321
00:15:02,301 --> 00:15:04,803
Eh, "To whom do you make your federal
tax check out

322
00:15:05,304 --> 00:15:06,805
on March 15?"

323
00:15:06,805 --> 00:15:08,307
You don't know that?

324
00:15:08,307 --> 00:15:11,310
"How do subfreezing temperatures in
the arctic

325
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:13,812
affect the growth of trees?"

326
00:15:14,813 --> 00:15:17,316
You don't know that one either?

327
00:15:17,316 --> 00:15:20,319
"Why was the steamship Ile de France

328
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:21,820
put in dry dock recently?"

329
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:23,322
I don't know any of those.

330
00:15:23,322 --> 00:15:24,823
You mean to tell me

331
00:15:24,823 --> 00:15:26,825
you can't answer these questions?

332
00:15:26,825 --> 00:15:28,827
Neither can I.

333
00:15:28,827 --> 00:15:30,329
Where are the answers?

334
00:15:30,329 --> 00:15:31,330
Oh, didn't I bring them in?

335
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:32,831
I must have left them on my desk.

336
00:15:32,831 --> 00:15:34,333
I'll go get them.

337
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:36,835
Say, there's a Mrs. Ricky Ricardo
outside to see you.

338
00:15:36,835 --> 00:15:38,837
Oh, yeah, she's one of the
contestants.

339
00:15:38,837 --> 00:15:39,838
Have her come in, will you?

340
00:15:39,838 --> 00:15:41,340
Okay.

341
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:43,342
You may come in, Mrs. Ricardo.

342
00:15:43,342 --> 00:15:44,343
Thank you.

343
00:15:44,343 --> 00:15:45,844
You do you do, Mrs. Ricardo?

344
00:15:46,345 --> 00:15:47,262
How do you do?

345
00:15:47,262 --> 00:15:48,263
Awfully nice of you to come down.

346
00:15:48,263 --> 00:15:49,264
Won't you sit down?

347
00:15:49,264 --> 00:15:51,266
Thank you. Uh...

348
00:15:51,266 --> 00:15:53,769
Mr. Fillmore, you can do me a
tremendous favor.

349
00:15:53,769 --> 00:15:56,271
You can get me out of a very big
spot.

350
00:15:56,271 --> 00:15:58,774
Anything you want, I'll do, Mrs.
Ricardo.

351
00:15:59,274 --> 00:16:00,743
Oh, thank you very much.

352
00:16:00,743 --> 00:16:01,744
And do you know why?

353
00:16:01,744 --> 00:16:02,745
Why?

354
00:16:03,245 --> 00:16:04,246
Because this is the biggest break
I've ever had

355
00:16:04,747 --> 00:16:06,248
having you and your husband appear on
my show tonight.

356
00:16:06,248 --> 00:16:07,750
Oh?

357
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:10,753
Yes. You see, I have an offer from a
national sponsor

358
00:16:10,753 --> 00:16:12,755
who's willing to buy the program

359
00:16:12,755 --> 00:16:14,757
if I can get people like Ricky
Ricardo to appear.

360
00:16:14,757 --> 00:16:15,758
Oh.

361
00:16:16,258 --> 00:16:17,760
And once he's appeared on the show
tonight

362
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:19,762
that'll pave the way for other
celebrities.

363
00:16:19,762 --> 00:16:20,763
Oh, I see.

364
00:16:20,763 --> 00:16:23,265
You don't realize what a break this
is for me.

365
00:16:23,265 --> 00:16:26,201
Now, what can I do for you?

366
00:16:26,201 --> 00:16:27,202
Uh...

367
00:16:27,202 --> 00:16:31,206
could I have some tickets for the
broadcast?

368
00:16:32,708 --> 00:16:33,709
Well, certainly.

369
00:16:33,709 --> 00:16:35,210
You can have all the tickets you
want.

370
00:16:35,711 --> 00:16:36,712
Pardon me, Mr. Fillmore

371
00:16:36,712 --> 00:16:38,213
here are the answers for tonight's
questions.

372
00:16:38,213 --> 00:16:41,717
Oh, thank you, Tommy.

373
00:16:41,717 --> 00:16:43,719
(chuckling)

374
00:16:43,719 --> 00:16:46,221
Have we got some pips for you
tonight.

375
00:16:46,221 --> 00:16:48,223
You have?

376
00:16:48,223 --> 00:16:49,725
Yes, we sure have.

377
00:16:51,226 --> 00:16:52,728
Oh, that's right, you wanted those
tickets.

378
00:16:53,228 --> 00:16:53,729
Yes, please.

379
00:16:54,229 --> 00:16:56,231
I'll take care of that right now.

380
00:16:56,231 --> 00:16:57,733
WOMAN: Yes, Mr. Fillmore?

381
00:16:57,733 --> 00:17:00,235
Nancy, will you see that Mrs. Ricardo

382
00:17:00,235 --> 00:17:02,237
gets all the tickets she wants,
please?

383
00:17:02,237 --> 00:17:03,238
(phone rings)

384
00:17:03,739 --> 00:17:05,240
Oh, excuse me.

385
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:06,241
Hello?

386
00:17:06,241 --> 00:17:09,244
Oh, yeah, yeah, I've got them right
here.

387
00:17:09,244 --> 00:17:10,746
Yeah, we can check it.

388
00:17:10,746 --> 00:17:11,747
One...

389
00:17:13,749 --> 00:17:14,750
Yeah.

390
00:17:16,752 --> 00:17:17,753
Uh, two...

391
00:17:20,756 --> 00:17:22,257
Yeah.

392
00:17:24,259 --> 00:17:26,762
Uh, three...

393
00:17:30,265 --> 00:17:32,267
Uh, yeah.

394
00:17:32,267 --> 00:17:33,769
Yeah, that checks.

395
00:17:33,769 --> 00:17:35,270
Okay, now, would you read

396
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:37,773
that opening commercial to me,
please?

397
00:17:37,773 --> 00:17:38,774
Uh-huh.

398
00:17:40,275 --> 00:17:43,278
That sounds good.

399
00:17:43,278 --> 00:17:45,781
Sure.

400
00:17:46,281 --> 00:17:48,283
Okay.

401
00:17:48,283 --> 00:17:49,785
Why, Mrs. Ricardo

402
00:17:49,785 --> 00:17:52,287
you wouldn't want to see the answers

403
00:17:52,287 --> 00:17:53,789
for tonight, would you?

404
00:17:53,789 --> 00:17:55,290
Oh, were those the answers?

405
00:17:55,290 --> 00:17:56,291
Well, yes.

406
00:17:56,792 --> 00:17:58,293
You didn't see them, did you?

407
00:17:58,293 --> 00:17:59,795
No, darn it.

408
00:17:59,795 --> 00:18:00,796
Well, good.

409
00:18:06,301 --> 00:18:07,302
Uh... well...

410
00:18:07,803 --> 00:18:09,304
Good-bye, Mr. Fillmore.

411
00:18:09,304 --> 00:18:10,305
Oh, well... good-bye, Mrs. Ricardo.

412
00:18:10,806 --> 00:18:12,808
So nice of you to come by.

413
00:18:12,808 --> 00:18:13,809
Thank you.

414
00:18:13,809 --> 00:18:15,310
I'll see you tonight.

415
00:18:15,310 --> 00:18:16,311
Thank you.

416
00:18:16,311 --> 00:18:17,312
(phone rings)

417
00:18:17,312 --> 00:18:18,814
Excuse me. Hello?

418
00:18:33,829 --> 00:18:38,917
(soundlessly)

419
00:18:42,421 --> 00:18:44,423
Hi, Lucy, you ready to go to the
broadcast?

420
00:18:44,423 --> 00:18:45,924
I was just going over these answers--

421
00:18:45,924 --> 00:18:46,925
see if I knew them.

422
00:18:46,925 --> 00:18:48,427
Here, you hold the paper.

423
00:18:48,427 --> 00:18:50,929
Uh, the first one is, "the collector
of Internal Revenue."

424
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:53,932
The second one is, "the sap runs
every two years."

425
00:18:53,932 --> 00:18:56,935
The third is, "to scrape the
barnacles off her hull."

426
00:18:56,935 --> 00:18:57,936
Perfect.

427
00:18:58,437 --> 00:18:59,938
Wonder what the questions are?

428
00:18:59,938 --> 00:19:02,941
Who cares, so long as I have the
answers?

429
00:19:04,943 --> 00:19:07,946
Come on, Come on. We might as well
get it over with.

430
00:19:07,946 --> 00:19:09,948
Oh, honey, don't look so worried.

431
00:19:09,948 --> 00:19:11,950
I have an idea I'm going to walk up
there

432
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:14,953
and give them those answers one, two,
three.

433
00:19:14,953 --> 00:19:16,955
You're so confident one would think
you knew

434
00:19:16,955 --> 00:19:18,457
what the questions were going to be.

435
00:19:18,957 --> 00:19:19,958
Yes, one would, wouldn't one?

436
00:19:19,958 --> 00:19:23,462
Come on, come on, we're all going to
be late.

437
00:19:23,462 --> 00:19:24,463
All right!

438
00:19:24,463 --> 00:19:25,464
(all talking at once)

439
00:19:25,464 --> 00:19:26,965
Let's go.

440
00:19:26,965 --> 00:19:28,467
Oh, I forgot something.

441
00:19:28,467 --> 00:19:29,968
I'll be right with you.

442
00:19:29,968 --> 00:19:31,470
All right.

443
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:35,474
Collector of Internal Revenue, the
sap runs every two years

444
00:19:35,474 --> 00:19:38,477
to... to scrape the barnacles off her
hull.

445
00:19:38,477 --> 00:19:40,479
Come on, honey, hurry up.

446
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:48,320
It's time for Mr. and Mrs. Quiz.

447
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:53,325
(applause and music)

448
00:19:53,325 --> 00:19:55,327
Yes, once again it's time to play

449
00:19:55,327 --> 00:19:58,330
that fascinating game, Mr. and Mrs.
Quiz

450
00:19:58,330 --> 00:19:59,831
and here to ask the questions

451
00:19:59,831 --> 00:20:01,833
is that well-known quizmaster

452
00:20:01,833 --> 00:20:03,335
Freddy Fillmore!

453
00:20:03,335 --> 00:20:07,839
(music and applause)

454
00:20:07,839 --> 00:20:09,841
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen

455
00:20:09,841 --> 00:20:12,344
and welcome once again to Mr. and
Mrs. Quiz.

456
00:20:12,844 --> 00:20:14,846
Now, for our first contestant tonight

457
00:20:14,846 --> 00:20:17,349
we have a gentleman known to all of
you

458
00:20:17,349 --> 00:20:19,351
as an orchestra leader and a singer.

459
00:20:19,351 --> 00:20:20,852
But what you don't know--

460
00:20:20,852 --> 00:20:22,354
and we didn't, either, until his wife
told us today--

461
00:20:22,354 --> 00:20:23,855
he's one of the greatest brains of
all time--

462
00:20:23,855 --> 00:20:24,856
a real top intellectual.

463
00:20:24,856 --> 00:20:26,358
Yes, sirree.

464
00:20:26,358 --> 00:20:29,861
And now, just in case you think we
picked questions

465
00:20:29,861 --> 00:20:31,863
to make him look good tonight

466
00:20:31,863 --> 00:20:34,366
we're going to change our usual
practice

467
00:20:34,366 --> 00:20:36,368
and have him select his questions

468
00:20:36,368 --> 00:20:38,370
out of this glass bowl, at random.

469
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:41,873
And now, here they are, Mr. and Mrs.
Ricky Ricardo!

470
00:20:41,873 --> 00:20:47,379
(applause)

471
00:20:47,379 --> 00:20:48,880
How do you do, Mr. and Mrs. Ricardo?

472
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:49,881
How do you do?

473
00:20:49,881 --> 00:20:51,383
You all ready for your questions?

474
00:20:51,383 --> 00:20:52,384
Yes, sir.

475
00:20:52,884 --> 00:20:54,886
Oh-ho, they're going to be pretty
hard.

476
00:20:54,886 --> 00:20:57,389
Oh, I'll bet they're not too hard.

477
00:20:57,389 --> 00:20:58,890
Well, we'll see about that.

478
00:20:58,890 --> 00:21:01,393
Now, remember, you only have one
answer

479
00:21:01,393 --> 00:21:03,395
between the two of you.

480
00:21:03,395 --> 00:21:05,397
Okay, dig right in there, Ricky.

481
00:21:05,397 --> 00:21:08,400
Ah, here we go for number one.

482
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:11,403
Ah. What is name of the animal that
fastens itself to you

483
00:21:11,403 --> 00:21:13,405
and drains you of your blood?

484
00:21:13,405 --> 00:21:16,408
The Collector of Internal Revenue.

485
00:21:24,416 --> 00:21:26,418
Oh, I...

486
00:21:26,418 --> 00:21:28,920
I... I'm so sorry.

487
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:30,922
You only had one answer between the
two of you

488
00:21:30,922 --> 00:21:32,424
and that's wrong.

489
00:21:32,424 --> 00:21:33,425
It is?

490
00:21:33,425 --> 00:21:35,427
Yes, the answer is, "a vampire bat."

491
00:21:35,427 --> 00:21:36,928
A vampire bat, sure--

492
00:21:37,429 --> 00:21:39,431
that's what I was going to say.

493
00:21:39,431 --> 00:21:41,433
Well, let's try the next one.

494
00:21:41,433 --> 00:21:43,935
Maybe we'll have better luck this
time.

495
00:21:43,935 --> 00:21:45,937
I'll get the next one.

496
00:21:45,937 --> 00:21:48,440
Ah, here we go, number two:

497
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:50,942
What is a senator's term of office?

498
00:21:52,444 --> 00:21:54,446
The sap runs every two years.

499
00:22:00,452 --> 00:22:02,454
Oh, I... I'm sorry, Mrs. Ricardo

500
00:22:02,954 --> 00:22:05,457
but you're not giving your husband a
chance.

501
00:22:05,457 --> 00:22:07,959
A senator's term of office is six
years.

502
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:09,461
Six years, sure.

503
00:22:09,461 --> 00:22:11,463
Why don't you let me answer one?

504
00:22:11,463 --> 00:22:13,465
Well, let's try the last one.

505
00:22:14,966 --> 00:22:17,469
Let me answer this one, eh?

506
00:22:17,469 --> 00:22:19,471
Here we go for number three.

507
00:22:19,471 --> 00:22:22,474
Why did the French people put Marie
Antoinette

508
00:22:22,974 --> 00:22:24,476
under the sharp blade of the
guillotine?

509
00:22:26,478 --> 00:22:27,979
Um...

510
00:22:27,979 --> 00:22:30,482
Well?

511
00:22:30,482 --> 00:22:31,983
You got any ideas?

512
00:22:33,985 --> 00:22:35,487
Well, come on, Ricardos

513
00:22:35,487 --> 00:22:36,988
you must know the answer to this one.

514
00:22:36,988 --> 00:22:38,490
Yeah, we know the answer to this one.

515
00:22:38,490 --> 00:22:39,991
Okay, why did the French people

516
00:22:40,492 --> 00:22:41,493
put Marie Antoinette

517
00:22:41,493 --> 00:22:43,495
under the sharp blade of the
guillotine?

518
00:22:43,495 --> 00:22:46,998
To scrape the barnacles off her hull.

519
00:22:51,503 --> 00:22:53,004
Oh, I'm so sorry.

520
00:22:53,004 --> 00:22:56,007
You are the first husband-and-wife
team ever

521
00:22:56,007 --> 00:22:58,009
to miss all three questions.

522
00:22:58,009 --> 00:23:00,011
What's the matter with you, honey?

523
00:23:00,011 --> 00:23:01,513
Well, I memorized the answers

524
00:23:01,513 --> 00:23:03,515
but they must have switched the
questions.

525
00:23:03,515 --> 00:23:05,517
Oh, no, what have you done to me?

526
00:23:05,517 --> 00:23:06,518
Well, anyway

527
00:23:06,518 --> 00:23:08,520
you still have a chance

528
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:10,522
at the giant jackpot question

529
00:23:10,522 --> 00:23:12,023
and it's worth $500.

530
00:23:12,023 --> 00:23:14,025
Ricky, it's not over yet.

531
00:23:14,025 --> 00:23:15,527
Now, we've all seen the picture

532
00:23:15,527 --> 00:23:17,529
of George Washington crossing the
Delaware.

533
00:23:17,529 --> 00:23:19,364
You've seen that picture, haven't
you?

534
00:23:19,364 --> 00:23:20,298
Yeah, yeah.

535
00:23:20,298 --> 00:23:21,299
And you've seen it too, haven't you?

536
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:22,801
Of course you have.

537
00:23:22,801 --> 00:23:25,303
Now, what I want you to tell me is
this:

538
00:23:25,303 --> 00:23:28,807
What did George Washington say while
making that crossing?

539
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:34,312
Yeah, I'll repeat the question:

540
00:23:34,312 --> 00:23:36,314
What did George Washington say

541
00:23:36,815 --> 00:23:38,817
while crossing the Delaware?

542
00:23:38,817 --> 00:23:40,318
Do you know, Ricky?

543
00:23:40,318 --> 00:23:42,821
Please let me sit down, this is
making me sick.

544
00:23:42,821 --> 00:23:44,823
That's right! That's what George
Washington said

545
00:23:44,823 --> 00:23:47,325
when crossing the Delaware!

546
00:23:47,325 --> 00:23:51,329
(all talking at once)

547
00:23:51,329 --> 00:23:54,833
(applause)

548
00:23:54,833 --> 00:23:59,838
(gleeful shouting)

549
00:23:59,838 --> 00:24:02,340
Five hundred bucks!

550
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:04,342
(applause)

551
00:24:09,331 --> 00:24:12,217
(theme music playing)

552
00:24:18,723 --> 00:24:21,726
The part of Freddy Fillmore was
played by Frank Nelson.

553
00:24:22,227 --> 00:24:23,728
The office boy was Bobby Ellis

554
00:24:23,728 --> 00:24:26,231
and the announcer was played by Roy
Rowan.

ANNOUNCER: I Love Lucy is a Desilu
production.


1
00:00:38,972 --> 00:00:42,475
Lucy, for goodness' sakes, aren't you
ready yet?

2
00:00:42,475 --> 00:00:44,477
I'll be ready in a minute, dear.

3
00:00:44,477 --> 00:00:46,479
Hurry up, we're going to miss

4
00:00:46,479 --> 00:00:47,981
the start of the movie.

5
00:00:47,981 --> 00:00:50,984
I'll be ready in a minute, dear.

6
00:00:50,984 --> 00:00:53,486
I wonder what time that feature
starts.

7
00:00:53,486 --> 00:00:55,488
What did you do with the paper?

8
00:00:55,488 --> 00:00:57,490
I'll be ready in a minute, dear.

9
00:00:57,490 --> 00:00:59,993
"I'll be ready in a minute, dear."

10
00:00:59,993 --> 00:01:01,995
"I'll be ready in a minute, dear."

11
00:01:01,995 --> 00:01:02,996
Ay-ay-ay.

12
00:01:02,996 --> 00:01:04,497
Oh, there it is.

13
00:01:08,501 --> 00:01:12,005
High Noon, Gary Cooper...

14
00:01:12,005 --> 00:01:14,007
8:23!

15
00:01:14,007 --> 00:01:16,009
I'll be ready in a minute, dear.

16
00:01:16,009 --> 00:01:17,510
Ay-ay-ay.

17
00:01:19,012 --> 00:01:21,514
Lucy, you haven't even got your dress
on yet.

18
00:01:22,015 --> 00:01:23,516
You were supposed to be ready an hour
ago.

19
00:01:23,516 --> 00:01:25,018
Well, it's all your fault.

20
00:01:25,018 --> 00:01:26,019
My fault?

21
00:01:26,019 --> 00:01:27,520
Yes, I wasted an hour

22
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,022
telling you I'd be ready in a minute.

23
00:01:29,522 --> 00:01:31,024
Oh, now, come on, what are you doing?

24
00:01:31,024 --> 00:01:33,526
Now, honey, I'm almost ready and
you're not helping any.

25
00:01:34,027 --> 00:01:35,528
If you want to make yourself useful

26
00:01:35,528 --> 00:01:37,030
get a dress out for me to put on.

27
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:38,531
All right, all right.

28
00:01:41,034 --> 00:01:43,036
Which dress you want to wear?

29
00:01:44,537 --> 00:01:46,039
Well, which dress you want to put on?

30
00:01:46,539 --> 00:01:47,040
I'm thinking.

31
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:48,541
I can't make up my mind.

32
00:01:49,042 --> 00:01:50,043
Put on any dress, honey.

33
00:01:50,043 --> 00:01:51,544
The Mertzes will be here in a minute.

34
00:01:51,544 --> 00:01:52,545
What makes you think so?

35
00:01:52,545 --> 00:01:54,047
I talked to Ethel ten minutes ago.

36
00:01:54,047 --> 00:01:55,548
She wasn't anywhere near ready.

37
00:01:55,548 --> 00:01:56,549
She'll be here.

38
00:01:57,050 --> 00:02:00,053
Fred told me that tonight she's going
to be here

39
00:02:00,053 --> 00:02:03,556
ready to go, with her coat on, at
8:00, no matter what.

40
00:02:03,556 --> 00:02:04,557
Hah! If I know Ethel

41
00:02:05,058 --> 00:02:06,559
she's just about getting out of the
tub.

42
00:02:06,559 --> 00:02:08,561
Well, look, just in case

43
00:02:08,561 --> 00:02:10,063
they happen to be on time

44
00:02:10,063 --> 00:02:13,066
would you please decide which dress
you want to put on?

45
00:02:13,066 --> 00:02:15,068
Well, what dress would you like me to
wear?

46
00:02:18,071 --> 00:02:19,572
How about this one, eh?

47
00:02:19,572 --> 00:02:20,573
You like that dress?

48
00:02:21,074 --> 00:02:23,576
Yeah, sure, I like it, it's
beautiful, fine.

49
00:02:23,576 --> 00:02:26,079
No, Ethel's seen me in that so much.

50
00:02:29,582 --> 00:02:30,583
How about this one?

51
00:02:30,583 --> 00:02:33,586
Oh, honey, everybody's seen me in
that.

52
00:02:38,091 --> 00:02:40,593
Oh, I wouldn't wear that to a movie.

53
00:02:40,593 --> 00:02:42,095
Why not?

54
00:02:42,095 --> 00:02:44,097
Don't tell me Gary Cooper has seen
you in it.

55
00:02:46,099 --> 00:02:47,600
No, it's too tight.

56
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,102
Ay-ay-ay.

57
00:02:49,102 --> 00:02:51,104
FRED: Hi, Rick, here we are!

58
00:02:51,104 --> 00:02:52,105
You folks ready?

59
00:02:52,105 --> 00:02:54,607
We'll be ready in a minute, dear.

60
00:02:57,610 --> 00:02:59,112
Now you got me doing it.

61
00:02:59,112 --> 00:03:01,114
You see, he's got Ethel up here,
ready to go

62
00:03:01,114 --> 00:03:02,115
just like he said he would.

63
00:03:02,115 --> 00:03:03,616
You go out and talk to them, dear.

64
00:03:03,616 --> 00:03:04,617
I'll be right out.

65
00:03:04,617 --> 00:03:05,618
Okay.

66
00:03:05,618 --> 00:03:07,620
Now, look, if you're not ready in
five minutes

67
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:08,621
we're going to go without you.

68
00:03:09,122 --> 00:03:10,123
Yes, dear.

69
00:03:10,123 --> 00:03:11,124
All right.

70
00:03:13,126 --> 00:03:14,627
Hiya, Fred, hi, Ethel.

71
00:03:14,627 --> 00:03:15,628
Hi, Rick.

72
00:03:15,628 --> 00:03:17,130
You did better than I did.

73
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:18,131
Lucy's still dressing.

74
00:03:18,631 --> 00:03:19,632
You're not firm enough.

75
00:03:19,632 --> 00:03:22,135
Well, I'll be firm enough tomorrow
night, boy.

76
00:03:22,635 --> 00:03:25,138
We're going to have dinner with the
new buss.

77
00:03:25,138 --> 00:03:27,640
You're having dinner with a bus?

78
00:03:29,642 --> 00:03:33,146
Mr. Littlefield-- the fellow that
bought the nightclub--

79
00:03:33,146 --> 00:03:35,148
I work for him now; he's my buss.

80
00:03:35,148 --> 00:03:37,650
Oh, I thought you meant bus

81
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:40,653
like they have at the boss station.

82
00:03:40,653 --> 00:03:41,654
Oh.

83
00:03:41,654 --> 00:03:43,156
Yeah.

84
00:03:43,156 --> 00:03:45,158
Well, she better be on time tomorrow
night

85
00:03:45,158 --> 00:03:46,659
or she'll really be known

86
00:03:46,659 --> 00:03:48,661
as the late Mrs. Ricardo.

87
00:03:48,661 --> 00:03:49,662
I heard that remark.

88
00:03:49,662 --> 00:03:50,663
Hi, Fred.
Hi, Lucy.

89
00:03:50,663 --> 00:03:51,664
Hi, Ethel.

90
00:03:51,664 --> 00:03:53,666
Oh, gee, do you look pretty!

91
00:03:53,666 --> 00:03:55,168
Is that new?

92
00:03:55,168 --> 00:03:57,170
What's the matter with you?

93
00:03:57,170 --> 00:03:58,671
Oh, she's mad at me.

94
00:03:58,671 --> 00:04:01,174
When I say 8:00, ready or not, I mean
it.

95
00:04:01,674 --> 00:04:03,176
I don't get it.

96
00:04:14,804 --> 00:04:17,307
Lucy, it's one minute to 7:00

97
00:04:17,307 --> 00:04:19,809
and we're supposed to be there at
7:30.

98
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:22,312
I'll be ready in a minute, dear.

99
00:04:22,812 --> 00:04:24,314
Lucy, I'm telling you

100
00:04:24,314 --> 00:04:27,317
I don't want anything to go wrong
tonight.

101
00:04:27,317 --> 00:04:29,319
I'm talking to Mr. Littlefield

102
00:04:29,319 --> 00:04:31,821
about making me the manager of the
club.

103
00:04:31,821 --> 00:04:35,325
Now, I'm going to give you 25
seconds...

104
00:04:35,825 --> 00:04:37,327
20 seconds...

105
00:04:37,327 --> 00:04:39,329
What were you saying, dear?

106
00:04:41,331 --> 00:04:45,335
Lucy, you're all dressed and ready to
go.

107
00:04:45,835 --> 00:04:47,337
Naturally.

108
00:04:47,337 --> 00:04:50,840
Well, I apologize for everything I
ever said.

109
00:04:51,841 --> 00:04:52,842
How did you do it?

110
00:04:53,343 --> 00:04:54,844
I played a little trick on myself.

111
00:04:54,844 --> 00:04:55,845
What do you mean?

112
00:04:55,845 --> 00:04:57,347
Well, knowing my own weakness

113
00:04:57,347 --> 00:04:59,349
I wanted to make sure that I'd be on
time

114
00:04:59,349 --> 00:05:00,850
so I turned the clock back

115
00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:02,352
so I'd have an extra hour.

116
00:05:02,352 --> 00:05:04,354
it's only 6:00, instead of 7:00.

117
00:05:04,354 --> 00:05:05,855
Why, honey, that's wonderful.

118
00:05:05,855 --> 00:05:06,856
I'm proud of you.

119
00:05:07,357 --> 00:05:08,358
Thank you.

120
00:05:08,358 --> 00:05:10,360
You know, I can really get things
done

121
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:12,362
if I just put my mind to it.

122
00:05:12,362 --> 00:05:13,863
Oh, gee, I hope the Littlefields

123
00:05:14,364 --> 00:05:15,365
have a good dinner.

124
00:05:15,365 --> 00:05:16,366
I'm starved.

125
00:05:16,366 --> 00:05:18,368
Me, too-- I didn't have any lunch.

126
00:05:18,868 --> 00:05:21,371
You know, that clock idea is real
clever.

127
00:05:21,371 --> 00:05:24,374
I should have thought of that a long
time ago.

128
00:05:24,374 --> 00:05:25,375
Come on, honey.

129
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:26,876
Okay, dear.

130
00:05:28,878 --> 00:05:31,881
Gee, look how dark it is, and it's
only 6:00.

131
00:05:32,382 --> 00:05:34,884
Yeah, well, the days are getting
shorter.

132
00:05:34,884 --> 00:05:37,387
No, they're not, they're getting
longer.

133
00:05:43,393 --> 00:05:44,394
Lucy?

134
00:05:44,394 --> 00:05:45,395
What?

135
00:05:45,395 --> 00:05:47,897
Which way did you turn this clock?

136
00:05:49,899 --> 00:05:51,901
Forward or backwards?

137
00:05:51,901 --> 00:05:53,903
Backwards, so I'd get an extra hour.

138
00:05:54,404 --> 00:05:55,405
Oh, no!

139
00:05:55,405 --> 00:05:57,407
You should have turned it forward.

140
00:05:57,407 --> 00:05:58,408
Forward?

141
00:05:58,408 --> 00:06:00,410
Sure, then when it said 7:00

142
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:01,911
it would only be 6:00.

143
00:06:01,911 --> 00:06:02,912
It's now 8:00.

144
00:06:02,912 --> 00:06:04,414
Eww...

145
00:06:05,915 --> 00:06:07,917
We'll be an hour late for dinner.

146
00:06:07,917 --> 00:06:09,419
Come on, will you?

147
00:06:09,419 --> 00:06:10,420
Oh, no!

148
00:06:13,806 --> 00:06:15,308
Alvin, what do you suppose

149
00:06:15,308 --> 00:06:17,810
could have happened to the Ricardos?

150
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:18,811
I can't imagine.

151
00:06:19,312 --> 00:06:21,314
I told them dinner at 7:30.

152
00:06:21,314 --> 00:06:22,315
It's nearly 8:30 now.

153
00:06:22,815 --> 00:06:25,318
Really, when I realize how you rushed
me.

154
00:06:25,318 --> 00:06:26,819
"Have it ready on time."

155
00:06:26,819 --> 00:06:28,821
"Have it ready on time."

156
00:06:28,821 --> 00:06:30,823
"Be sure it's ready on time."

157
00:06:30,823 --> 00:06:33,826
Phoebe, you know I consider tardiness
a major sin.

158
00:06:33,826 --> 00:06:37,330
I wish I could get you to feel that
way.

159
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:42,335
Oh, darling, why do you persist in
sneaking these in here?

160
00:06:42,335 --> 00:06:44,337
They're so cheap-looking.

161
00:06:46,339 --> 00:06:48,341
We can afford real fruit, you know.

162
00:06:48,341 --> 00:06:49,342
Alvin...

163
00:06:49,342 --> 00:06:50,843
Mama gave us that wax fruit

164
00:06:50,843 --> 00:06:51,844
for our wedding anniversary.

165
00:06:51,844 --> 00:06:52,845
You put it right back...

166
00:06:52,845 --> 00:06:53,846
I don't care, Phoebe...

167
00:06:54,347 --> 00:06:56,349
(doorbell buzzes)

168
00:06:56,349 --> 00:06:58,851
Oh, there they are now.

169
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:09,362
Well, come in, come in, come in.

170
00:07:09,362 --> 00:07:11,364
I don't believe you've met Mrs.
Littlefield.

171
00:07:11,364 --> 00:07:12,365
Phoebe, may I present

172
00:07:12,365 --> 00:07:13,366
Mrs. Ricardo, Mr. Ricardo.

173
00:07:13,366 --> 00:07:14,867
How do you do?
How do you do?

174
00:07:14,867 --> 00:07:15,868
Pleasure.

175
00:07:15,868 --> 00:07:17,870
I'm so sorry that we're late.

176
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:18,871
It's just disgraceful.

177
00:07:19,372 --> 00:07:19,872
It's quite all...

178
00:07:20,373 --> 00:07:21,374
Won't you sit down?

179
00:07:21,374 --> 00:07:22,375
Mr. Ricardo

180
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:24,877
you come and sit here next to me.

181
00:07:24,877 --> 00:07:25,878
Thank you, thank you.

182
00:07:25,878 --> 00:07:28,881
Gee, I hope we haven't ruined your
dinner.

183
00:07:28,881 --> 00:07:30,383
Oh, not at all.

184
00:07:30,383 --> 00:07:31,384
Of course not.

185
00:07:31,384 --> 00:07:32,385
Oh, that's good.

186
00:07:32,385 --> 00:07:35,388
It was delicious.

187
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:39,892
You mean you finished dinner?

188
00:07:39,892 --> 00:07:41,394
Oh, some time ago.

189
00:07:41,394 --> 00:07:44,397
When I say 7:30, I mean 7:30.

190
00:07:44,397 --> 00:07:45,398
Oh.

191
00:07:45,398 --> 00:07:47,400
Of course, I could fix you something

192
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,402
even though everything has been put
away

193
00:07:49,402 --> 00:07:50,903
and the dishes are all washed.

194
00:07:50,903 --> 00:07:55,408
Oh, well, I hate to bother you, but,
gee, I'm so darn hungry...

195
00:07:55,908 --> 00:07:57,410
No, thank you, Mrs. Littlefield,
we've eaten.

196
00:07:57,410 --> 00:07:58,911
But Ricky...

197
00:07:58,911 --> 00:08:00,413
We've eaten.

198
00:08:00,413 --> 00:08:03,916
(audience laughing)

199
00:08:03,916 --> 00:08:04,917
See, when we saw

200
00:08:04,917 --> 00:08:06,919
that we couldn't get a cab right away

201
00:08:06,919 --> 00:08:08,421
we had a little snack.

202
00:08:08,421 --> 00:08:10,923
MRS. LITTLEFIELD: Oh, well, if you're
quite sure.

203
00:08:10,923 --> 00:08:13,926
It's too bad you couldn't make it for
dinner.

204
00:08:13,926 --> 00:08:15,428
Phoebe outdid herself.

205
00:08:15,428 --> 00:08:16,929
It wasn't anything special.

206
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:18,431
Just pork chops.

207
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:19,432
Pork chops?

208
00:08:19,932 --> 00:08:21,434
Oh, they're my favorite.

209
00:08:21,934 --> 00:08:23,936
Oh, then you would have loved these.

210
00:08:23,936 --> 00:08:25,438
They were stuffed

211
00:08:25,438 --> 00:08:28,941
and about that thick.

212
00:08:28,941 --> 00:08:29,942
About that thick?

213
00:08:30,443 --> 00:08:32,445
And the potatoes were a masterpiece.

214
00:08:32,445 --> 00:08:33,946
Now, Alvin!

215
00:08:33,946 --> 00:08:36,449
But they were, my dear, they were--

216
00:08:36,449 --> 00:08:39,952
baked, and with big globs of
cheese...

217
00:08:41,454 --> 00:08:43,456
and butter.

218
00:08:43,456 --> 00:08:45,958
Big globs of cheese and butter?

219
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:47,960
I must have gained five pounds

220
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,962
what, with all that cheese and butter

221
00:08:50,463 --> 00:08:51,964
and the hollandaise sauce.

222
00:08:51,964 --> 00:08:52,965
Hollandaise sauce?

223
00:08:52,965 --> 00:08:53,966
What was it on?

224
00:08:53,966 --> 00:08:54,967
Asparagus tips--

225
00:08:55,468 --> 00:08:58,471
fresh, tender asparagus tips.

226
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:06,479
Are you sure you've both had dinner?

227
00:09:06,479 --> 00:09:07,980
Oh, yes, we had plenty.

228
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:08,981
Didn't we, Lucy?

229
00:09:08,981 --> 00:09:10,983
Hollandaise sauce, huh?

230
00:09:10,983 --> 00:09:13,986
Perhaps you'd like an after-dinner
mint.

231
00:09:13,986 --> 00:09:15,488
Oh, where are they?
Where are they?

232
00:09:18,491 --> 00:09:20,493
(clears throat)

233
00:09:21,494 --> 00:09:23,496
Well, I think I have room

234
00:09:23,496 --> 00:09:26,499
for just one teensy- weensy mint.

235
00:09:26,499 --> 00:09:27,500
I always say

236
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:30,503
there's nothing quite...

237
00:09:30,503 --> 00:09:35,007
(audience laughing)

238
00:09:44,016 --> 00:09:45,518
There's nothing

239
00:09:45,518 --> 00:09:48,521
quite like a good after-dinner mint,
is there?

240
00:09:50,523 --> 00:09:52,024
Oh!

241
00:09:52,024 --> 00:09:54,026
(mumbles)

242
00:09:55,528 --> 00:09:57,530
I'll get some more.

243
00:09:59,532 --> 00:10:01,534
(clears throat)

244
00:10:03,035 --> 00:10:04,537
I must say, Mr. Ricardo

245
00:10:04,537 --> 00:10:07,540
I hope this being late isn't a habit
with you.

246
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:09,041
I like punctuality

247
00:10:09,041 --> 00:10:11,043
in the people who work for me.

248
00:10:11,043 --> 00:10:12,044
Oh, yes, I know.

249
00:10:12,044 --> 00:10:14,046
This was just an accident, sir.

250
00:10:14,046 --> 00:10:16,048
LITTLEFIELD: Well, I hope it was.

251
00:10:22,054 --> 00:10:24,056
(screams:)
Mrs. Ricardo!

252
00:10:25,057 --> 00:10:26,058
RICKY: Lucy!

253
00:10:26,058 --> 00:10:28,060
Lucy!

254
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:29,562
(all yelling)

255
00:10:42,775 --> 00:10:45,277
Honey, I don't know what you're so
upset about.

256
00:10:45,778 --> 00:10:49,281
The Littlefields understood when we
explained the clock business.

257
00:10:49,281 --> 00:10:52,284
Mrs. Littlefield cooked dinner for
us, didn't she?

258
00:10:52,284 --> 00:10:53,285
It doesn't matter.

259
00:10:53,285 --> 00:10:54,787
It was very embarrassing.

260
00:10:54,787 --> 00:10:57,790
She wouldn't have had to go through
all that trouble

261
00:10:57,790 --> 00:10:59,291
if you would have been on time.

262
00:10:59,291 --> 00:11:01,794
Now, how long does it take you in the
bathtub?

263
00:11:02,294 --> 00:11:04,296
To do what?

264
00:11:06,298 --> 00:11:08,300
What are you writing there?

265
00:11:09,301 --> 00:11:10,803
"Lucy's schedule"?

266
00:11:10,803 --> 00:11:11,804
Lucy who?

267
00:11:11,804 --> 00:11:13,305
Lucy you, that's who.

268
00:11:13,305 --> 00:11:14,807
Let me see this.

269
00:11:14,807 --> 00:11:16,308
I'm making out a schedule

270
00:11:16,308 --> 00:11:18,310
so you can budget your time.

271
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:19,311
Budget my time?

272
00:11:19,311 --> 00:11:20,813
You mean like I budget my money?

273
00:11:20,813 --> 00:11:21,814
Heaven forbid.

274
00:11:21,814 --> 00:11:22,815
Give me that.

275
00:11:22,815 --> 00:11:24,316
Now, Ricky, listen...

276
00:11:24,316 --> 00:11:25,317
You listen to me.

277
00:11:25,317 --> 00:11:26,819
Now, I'm sick and tired

278
00:11:26,819 --> 00:11:28,320
of you being late all the time.

279
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,322
It's obvious you cannot budget your
time

280
00:11:30,823 --> 00:11:32,324
so somebody has to do it for you.

281
00:11:32,324 --> 00:11:34,827
Well, I don't think I'm going to like
this.

282
00:11:34,827 --> 00:11:35,828
How does it go?

283
00:11:35,828 --> 00:11:38,831
Well, we'll write down everything
that you do

284
00:11:38,831 --> 00:11:41,834
and we'll allow so much time for each
thing--

285
00:11:41,834 --> 00:11:44,336
ten minutes for this, 15 minutes for
that...

286
00:11:44,336 --> 00:11:48,340
Oh, I'm going to need more than 15
minutes for that.

287
00:11:50,342 --> 00:11:51,844
Never mind.

288
00:11:51,844 --> 00:11:53,846
You're going to go on this schedule

289
00:11:53,846 --> 00:11:56,849
and you're starting tomorrow morning,
understand?

290
00:12:16,635 --> 00:12:17,636
Good morning, dear.

291
00:12:17,636 --> 00:12:19,138
Good morning.

292
00:12:19,138 --> 00:12:21,140
How about a good-morning kiss?

293
00:12:22,641 --> 00:12:24,643
Sorry, it's not on the schedule.

294
00:12:30,149 --> 00:12:32,151
You know, as a matter of fact I want
to congratulate you

295
00:12:32,151 --> 00:12:34,153
on the way you've been budgeting your
time

296
00:12:34,153 --> 00:12:35,154
in the last few days.

297
00:12:35,154 --> 00:12:36,655
Well, as much as I hate to admit it,

298
00:12:36,655 --> 00:12:38,157
this thing does seem to work.

299
00:12:38,157 --> 00:12:39,158
Good.

300
00:12:39,158 --> 00:12:40,159
Is breakfast ready?

301
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:41,160
Yep, all set.

302
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,161
There's nothing on the stove.

303
00:12:42,161 --> 00:12:43,662
Where is it?

304
00:12:43,662 --> 00:12:45,164
Well, I knew I wouldn't have time

305
00:12:45,664 --> 00:12:46,665
to cook it this morning.

306
00:12:46,665 --> 00:12:49,168
So, I had some time left over last
night

307
00:12:49,168 --> 00:12:51,170
so I cooked breakfast last night.

308
00:12:54,173 --> 00:12:55,174
You did what?

309
00:12:55,174 --> 00:12:56,675
Don't worry about it spoiling.

310
00:12:56,675 --> 00:12:58,177
It's all in the freezer.

311
00:13:12,691 --> 00:13:14,693
Lucy, I can't eat this egg.

312
00:13:14,693 --> 00:13:15,694
Why not?

313
00:13:15,694 --> 00:13:17,696
It's too salty.

314
00:13:20,199 --> 00:13:21,700
Well, I'd cook you another one

315
00:13:22,201 --> 00:13:23,702
but it would throw me off schedule.

316
00:13:23,702 --> 00:13:26,205
Never mind, I have an appointment
with Mr. Littlefield.

317
00:13:26,205 --> 00:13:27,706
Just give me some coffee, huh?

318
00:13:27,706 --> 00:13:28,707
Yes, sir.

319
00:13:28,707 --> 00:13:29,708
Thank you.

320
00:13:56,735 --> 00:13:57,736
Lucy...

321
00:13:57,736 --> 00:13:58,737
What's the matter?

322
00:13:58,737 --> 00:14:01,240
You always like iced coffee.

323
00:14:26,682 --> 00:14:28,684
More coffee, Ricky?

324
00:14:28,684 --> 00:14:30,686
Oh, yes, thank you.

325
00:14:31,186 --> 00:14:32,187
Another roll?

326
00:14:32,688 --> 00:14:33,689
Don't mind if I do.

327
00:14:37,192 --> 00:14:40,195
Don't you people ever eat at your
house?

328
00:14:40,195 --> 00:14:41,697
Yes, sir.

329
00:14:41,697 --> 00:14:44,700
It's just that I have a very big
appetite.

330
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:46,201
Oh. Oh, I see.

331
00:14:46,201 --> 00:14:48,704
Well, let's get down to business.

332
00:14:48,704 --> 00:14:50,706
I've been thinking over your
suggestion

333
00:14:50,706 --> 00:14:52,708
about being the manager of the club

334
00:14:52,708 --> 00:14:54,209
and I'd like to talk to you about it.

335
00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:55,210
Well, certainly.

336
00:14:55,711 --> 00:14:56,712
I've been watching you

337
00:14:56,712 --> 00:14:58,714
and I like the way you handle things.

338
00:14:58,714 --> 00:14:59,715
Oh, thank you.

339
00:14:59,715 --> 00:15:01,216
In fact, you have all the
qualifications

340
00:15:01,717 --> 00:15:02,718
to be manager of the Tropicana.

341
00:15:02,718 --> 00:15:05,721
Oh, well, then can I...
can I get the job?

342
00:15:06,221 --> 00:15:07,723
No.

343
00:15:07,723 --> 00:15:09,224
Oh.

344
00:15:09,224 --> 00:15:12,728
I'd say yes, except for one little
thing--

345
00:15:12,728 --> 00:15:16,732
that business about being late for
dinner the other night.

346
00:15:16,732 --> 00:15:18,734
Oh, but that was my wife's fault.

347
00:15:18,734 --> 00:15:19,735
Oh, that's just it.

348
00:15:19,735 --> 00:15:21,236
If a man can't run his own home

349
00:15:21,236 --> 00:15:23,739
I certainly can't give him a
nightclub to manage.

350
00:15:24,239 --> 00:15:25,240
Uh, cigarette?

351
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:26,742
Yes, thank you.

352
00:15:27,242 --> 00:15:29,244
You can appreciate my position, of
course.

353
00:15:29,244 --> 00:15:31,747
Oh, yes, sir, I do, of course I do.

354
00:15:33,749 --> 00:15:35,751
Uh...

355
00:15:36,251 --> 00:15:38,754
You see, Mr. Littlefield, you don't
understand.

356
00:15:39,254 --> 00:15:40,255
That was before.

357
00:15:40,255 --> 00:15:42,758
Things are all different now.

358
00:15:42,758 --> 00:15:43,759
Oh?

359
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:44,760
Oh, yes, sir.

360
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:47,763
The other night when I got home, I
laid down the law.

361
00:15:47,763 --> 00:15:50,766
I made out a schedule and I'm making
her stick to it.

362
00:15:50,766 --> 00:15:51,767
And?

363
00:15:52,267 --> 00:15:53,769
It's working fine.

364
00:15:53,769 --> 00:15:56,271
She's really doing what you say?

365
00:15:56,271 --> 00:15:57,773
Oh, sir, I got her jumping around

366
00:15:57,773 --> 00:15:59,274
like a trained seal.

367
00:15:59,274 --> 00:16:00,776
A trained seal.

368
00:16:00,776 --> 00:16:01,777
(chuckles)

369
00:16:01,777 --> 00:16:03,779
(chuckles)

370
00:16:03,779 --> 00:16:07,783
Oh, I sure would like to see a thing
like that.

371
00:16:08,283 --> 00:16:09,785
Well, why don't you come for dinner
tonight

372
00:16:10,285 --> 00:16:11,787
and you can see how the schedule
works?

373
00:16:11,787 --> 00:16:12,788
May I bring my wife?

374
00:16:13,288 --> 00:16:14,289
Certainly.

375
00:16:14,289 --> 00:16:15,290
Then she can see

376
00:16:15,290 --> 00:16:17,292
that a house can be run on schedule.

377
00:16:17,292 --> 00:16:19,294
If it works the way you say it does,

378
00:16:19,294 --> 00:16:20,295
you can be the new manager.

379
00:16:20,796 --> 00:16:21,797
Thank you very much.

380
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:25,050
ETHEL: Hi.

381
00:16:25,551 --> 00:16:26,552
Oh, oh!

382
00:16:26,552 --> 00:16:28,053
Hi, Ethel.

383
00:16:28,053 --> 00:16:29,555
Uh... sit down.

384
00:16:29,555 --> 00:16:31,557
I have three and a half minutes to
spare.

385
00:16:31,557 --> 00:16:34,059
Listen, Lucy, you're going to have to
cut out

386
00:16:34,059 --> 00:16:35,060
this schedule business.

387
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:36,562
Why?

388
00:16:36,562 --> 00:16:38,564
'Cause Fred thinks it's a wonderful
idea.

389
00:16:38,564 --> 00:16:41,066
If it works out, he's going to put me
on one.

390
00:16:41,066 --> 00:16:42,568
Well, truthfully, Ethel

391
00:16:42,568 --> 00:16:44,069
I find that I get everything done

392
00:16:44,069 --> 00:16:45,571
and I have time left over.

393
00:16:45,571 --> 00:16:48,073
Of course, I cheated a little bit.

394
00:16:48,073 --> 00:16:50,576
What do you mean, you cheated a
little bit?

395
00:16:50,576 --> 00:16:53,078
I drew in an extra hour at the bottom
of the chart.

396
00:16:53,078 --> 00:16:55,581
Where did you get the extra hour?

397
00:16:55,581 --> 00:16:58,584
From the next day.

398
00:16:58,584 --> 00:17:00,085
From the next day?

399
00:17:00,085 --> 00:17:03,589
Yeah, it'll work out fine till the
end of the year

400
00:17:03,589 --> 00:17:06,091
and then I'll be two weeks short.

401
00:17:06,091 --> 00:17:07,593
(doorbell buzzes)

402
00:17:08,093 --> 00:17:09,094
Who can that be?

403
00:17:12,097 --> 00:17:14,099
Oh, Mrs. Littlefield!

404
00:17:14,099 --> 00:17:15,100
How do you do?

405
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:16,101
Come in, won't you?

406
00:17:16,101 --> 00:17:18,604
Uh, this is my neighbor Ethel Mertz.

407
00:17:18,604 --> 00:17:20,606
This is Mrs. Littlefield.

408
00:17:20,606 --> 00:17:21,607
Sit down, won't you?

409
00:17:21,607 --> 00:17:22,608
Thank you.

410
00:17:23,108 --> 00:17:25,110
Well, I... I didn't expect you until
tonight.

411
00:17:25,611 --> 00:17:27,613
Mrs. Ricardo, what are you trying to
do

412
00:17:28,113 --> 00:17:29,615
to the wives of America?

413
00:17:29,615 --> 00:17:31,617
I beg your pardon?

414
00:17:31,617 --> 00:17:33,118
Your husband told my husband

415
00:17:33,619 --> 00:17:36,622
that you're running this house on a
time schedule.

416
00:17:36,622 --> 00:17:37,122
That's right.

417
00:17:37,122 --> 00:17:39,124
You Benedict Arnold.

418
00:17:39,124 --> 00:17:40,626
What do you mean?

419
00:17:40,626 --> 00:17:43,629
We wives have spent years persuading
our husbands

420
00:17:43,629 --> 00:17:45,631
that we haven't time to do our work.

421
00:17:46,131 --> 00:17:47,633
Now, if you go through with this

422
00:17:48,133 --> 00:17:49,635
you'll louse it up for all of us.

423
00:17:50,135 --> 00:17:51,136
You're darned right.

424
00:17:51,136 --> 00:17:53,138
My husband wants to put me

425
00:17:53,138 --> 00:17:54,139
on a schedule, too.

426
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,141
If my Alvin sees what he likes

427
00:17:56,642 --> 00:17:57,643
here at dinner tonight

428
00:17:57,643 --> 00:18:00,646
I start punching a time clock
tomorrow.

429
00:18:00,646 --> 00:18:02,147
Well, I can't let Ricky down.

430
00:18:02,147 --> 00:18:03,649
He's asked you here tonight

431
00:18:04,149 --> 00:18:05,651
to show you how proud he is of me.

432
00:18:06,151 --> 00:18:07,152
Oh, yes?

433
00:18:07,152 --> 00:18:09,655
Well, I overheard him tell my husband

434
00:18:09,655 --> 00:18:12,157
that he had you hopping around

435
00:18:12,157 --> 00:18:13,659
like a trained seal.

436
00:18:13,659 --> 00:18:17,162
Oh, he didn't mean it like that.

437
00:18:17,162 --> 00:18:20,165
No, of course not.

438
00:18:20,165 --> 00:18:22,668
Trained seal, huh?

439
00:18:22,668 --> 00:18:23,669
It was probably

440
00:18:24,169 --> 00:18:26,171
just an unfortunate choice of words

441
00:18:26,672 --> 00:18:28,674
when he invited us here tonight

442
00:18:28,674 --> 00:18:30,175
to "watch you perform."

443
00:18:30,175 --> 00:18:32,177
"Watch me perform"?

444
00:18:32,177 --> 00:18:34,680
Well, I'm sorry, but you're not going
to see me

445
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:36,682
balance a ball on my nose tonight.

446
00:18:36,682 --> 00:18:37,683
Good girl!

447
00:18:37,683 --> 00:18:39,184
Lucy, what are you going to do?

448
00:18:39,184 --> 00:18:41,186
Will you and Fred come to dinner
tonight?

449
00:18:41,186 --> 00:18:42,187
Sure.

450
00:18:42,187 --> 00:18:43,689
This is no time for formality.

451
00:18:43,689 --> 00:18:44,690
Phoebe, will you help me?

452
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:45,691
Lucy, I'll do anything.

453
00:18:46,191 --> 00:18:47,192
Thank you.

454
00:18:47,192 --> 00:18:48,193
Me, too.

455
00:18:48,193 --> 00:18:49,194
Thank you.

456
00:18:49,194 --> 00:18:51,196
Trained seals of the world, unite!

457
00:18:51,697 --> 00:18:53,699
(barking)

458
00:18:55,584 --> 00:18:56,084
Lucy?

459
00:18:56,585 --> 00:18:58,086
Yes, dear?

460
00:18:58,086 --> 00:18:59,588
Are you sure dinner is going to be
ready

461
00:18:59,588 --> 00:19:01,089
when the Littlefields get here?

462
00:19:01,089 --> 00:19:02,090
Now, don't worry, dear.

463
00:19:02,591 --> 00:19:04,092
Everything will come off right on
schedule.

464
00:19:04,092 --> 00:19:05,093
Good girl.

465
00:19:05,093 --> 00:19:06,595
I got to hand it to you--

466
00:19:06,595 --> 00:19:09,097
that schedule idea was a real
brainstorm.

467
00:19:09,097 --> 00:19:11,099
I'm putting Ethel on one tomorrow.

468
00:19:11,099 --> 00:19:12,601
RICKY: Attaboy!

469
00:19:12,601 --> 00:19:15,604
You know, that little idea is going
to make me

470
00:19:15,604 --> 00:19:16,605
a nightclub manager.

471
00:19:17,105 --> 00:19:17,606
Good.

472
00:19:18,106 --> 00:19:19,107
(doorbell buzzes)

473
00:19:19,107 --> 00:19:20,108
Here they are.

474
00:19:23,111 --> 00:19:24,112
Come on in, come on in.

475
00:19:24,112 --> 00:19:26,114
Hello, good evening, Mr. Littlefield.

476
00:19:26,114 --> 00:19:27,115
How are you?

477
00:19:27,115 --> 00:19:28,116
Oh!

478
00:19:30,118 --> 00:19:31,620
Sit right down here, Mr. Littlefield.

479
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:33,121
Oh, I'd like you to meet Mr. Mertz.

480
00:19:33,622 --> 00:19:34,623
Mr. Littlefield.

481
00:19:34,623 --> 00:19:36,124
How do you do?
Sit right down.

482
00:19:36,124 --> 00:19:37,626
Come in, Mrs. Littlefield.

483
00:19:37,626 --> 00:19:39,127
Right over in here.

484
00:19:40,629 --> 00:19:41,630
Lucy.

485
00:19:42,130 --> 00:19:42,631
What?

486
00:19:43,131 --> 00:19:43,632
What is this?

487
00:19:44,132 --> 00:19:45,133
Well, can't waste time.

488
00:19:45,133 --> 00:19:47,135
Got to keep on schedule, you know.

489
00:19:47,135 --> 00:19:48,136
Oh, oh.

490
00:19:48,136 --> 00:19:49,137
Oh, Mr. Little...

491
00:19:49,137 --> 00:19:49,638
the schedule, you know,

492
00:19:50,138 --> 00:19:51,139
Mr. Littlefield, the schedule.

493
00:19:51,139 --> 00:19:52,641
Oh. Oh, yeah, very interesting.

494
00:19:52,641 --> 00:19:53,642
Well, let's talk.

495
00:19:53,642 --> 00:19:55,143
How have you been, Mr. Littlefield?

496
00:19:55,644 --> 00:19:56,645
Oh, fine, fine.

497
00:19:56,645 --> 00:19:58,146
I had a cold, but I went to the
doctor.

498
00:19:58,146 --> 00:19:59,147
He gave me a shot.

499
00:19:59,147 --> 00:20:00,649
It went right away.

500
00:20:00,649 --> 00:20:03,151
Of course, there's been a lot of
colds going around...

501
00:20:03,151 --> 00:20:04,152
Time's up!

502
00:20:04,152 --> 00:20:05,654
How are you, Fred?

503
00:20:08,156 --> 00:20:09,658
Not so good-- I got kind of a
hitch...

504
00:20:09,658 --> 00:20:12,661
Sorry. Mr. Littlefield used up all
your time.

505
00:20:12,661 --> 00:20:13,662
How about a drink?

506
00:20:13,662 --> 00:20:14,663
Yeah, that's a good idea.

507
00:20:14,663 --> 00:20:15,664
I'd love one!

508
00:20:15,664 --> 00:20:17,165
Yeah, so would I; had a hard day.

509
00:20:17,165 --> 00:20:18,667
A drink would just hit the spot.

510
00:20:18,667 --> 00:20:20,669
Well, it's too bad we don't have time
for one.

511
00:20:21,169 --> 00:20:22,170
Well, let's sit down and eat.

512
00:20:22,170 --> 00:20:23,672
You sit right here, Mr. Littlefield.

513
00:20:24,172 --> 00:20:26,174
Fred, you're right across from Mr.
Littlefield.

514
00:20:26,174 --> 00:20:28,176
Mrs. Littlefield, would you help me
in the kitchen?

515
00:20:28,176 --> 00:20:29,177
I'd love to.

516
00:20:29,678 --> 00:20:31,179
Lucy, Mrs. Littlefield is a guest.

517
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:32,180
I don't mind.

518
00:20:32,681 --> 00:20:33,682
She doesn't mind.

519
00:20:37,185 --> 00:20:39,688
Well, I'm really hungry.

520
00:20:39,688 --> 00:20:40,689
Me, too.

521
00:20:40,689 --> 00:20:41,690
Well, that's good

522
00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:45,193
because Lucy's a wonderful little
cook, you know.

523
00:20:45,193 --> 00:20:46,695
RICKY: Yes, sir!

524
00:20:46,695 --> 00:20:47,696
Soup.

525
00:20:47,696 --> 00:20:48,697
Soup!

526
00:20:48,697 --> 00:20:50,699
Oh, and doesn't that look good.

527
00:20:50,699 --> 00:20:52,200
RICKY: Isn't that nice?

528
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:54,202
LUCY: Well, dig in, everybody.

529
00:20:58,707 --> 00:21:00,709
Lucy, where are you going?

530
00:21:00,709 --> 00:21:02,711
It's all the time we had for soup.

531
00:21:02,711 --> 00:21:04,713
Got to stick to the schedule, you
know.

532
00:21:04,713 --> 00:21:05,714
The schedule.

533
00:21:05,714 --> 00:21:06,715
The schedule.

534
00:21:14,222 --> 00:21:17,225
I didn't have time to taste it.

535
00:21:17,225 --> 00:21:18,226
(audience laughing)

536
00:21:18,226 --> 00:21:20,228
Too bad. It was delicious.

537
00:21:20,228 --> 00:21:24,733
I wonder what kind it was.

538
00:21:25,734 --> 00:21:27,235
Split pea, I think.

539
00:21:31,239 --> 00:21:33,241
Split pea, yep.

540
00:21:37,245 --> 00:21:38,246
Salad.

541
00:21:38,246 --> 00:21:39,247
Salad!

542
00:21:39,247 --> 00:21:40,248
Well, this is a nice salad.

543
00:21:40,248 --> 00:21:41,249
Looks fine.

544
00:21:41,249 --> 00:21:42,250
Doesn't that look good.

545
00:21:42,751 --> 00:21:43,752
That is really...

546
00:21:43,752 --> 00:21:45,253
(audience laughing)

547
00:21:59,501 --> 00:22:01,470
Did you get any?

548
00:22:02,971 --> 00:22:03,972
Me, either.

549
00:22:07,476 --> 00:22:08,477
Look, look.

550
00:22:08,977 --> 00:22:10,979
There's a radish.

551
00:22:10,979 --> 00:22:11,980
Ah!

552
00:22:14,983 --> 00:22:16,985
(chortles)

553
00:22:22,491 --> 00:22:24,493
RICKY: Lucy!

554
00:22:24,493 --> 00:22:25,994
What are you trying to do?

555
00:22:25,994 --> 00:22:27,996
Just trying to stay on schedule.

556
00:22:28,497 --> 00:22:29,498
I'll talk to you later.

557
00:22:29,498 --> 00:22:30,999
Well, okay.

558
00:22:30,999 --> 00:22:34,002
I think I have some free time at
11:43 tonight.

559
00:22:36,004 --> 00:22:38,507
What's the matter, Mr. Littlefield?

560
00:22:38,507 --> 00:22:41,009
There's a shirt button in my water
glass!

561
00:22:41,009 --> 00:22:42,010
Lucy!

562
00:22:42,010 --> 00:22:43,512
LUCY: Yes, dear?

563
00:22:44,012 --> 00:22:46,798
There's a shirt button in Mr.
Littlefield's water glass!

564
00:22:46,798 --> 00:22:48,650
Oh, well, I know how that happened.

565
00:22:48,650 --> 00:22:50,652
You see, I found that I could save
time

566
00:22:50,652 --> 00:22:53,155
by washing the dishes and the clothes
together.

567
00:23:06,668 --> 00:23:08,170
What is this?

568
00:23:08,170 --> 00:23:10,172
Steak and peas.

569
00:23:10,172 --> 00:23:11,173
They look frozen.

570
00:23:11,173 --> 00:23:12,674
They are.

571
00:23:12,674 --> 00:23:15,677
You see, there's no time on the
schedule for defrosting.

572
00:23:15,677 --> 00:23:17,179
But don't worry.

573
00:23:17,179 --> 00:23:19,681
We have some nice hot biscuits.

574
00:23:19,681 --> 00:23:22,184
Ethel, let's have those biscuits!

575
00:23:22,184 --> 00:23:23,685
Here we go, girl!

576
00:23:23,685 --> 00:23:25,187
LUCY: Right smack through the middle!

577
00:23:25,187 --> 00:23:26,688
There we go, yes, sir!

578
00:23:26,688 --> 00:23:27,689
Pass them right along.

579
00:23:27,689 --> 00:23:28,690
That a girl!

580
00:23:28,690 --> 00:23:31,193
Come on, Ethel, that's it, kid!

581
00:23:31,193 --> 00:23:32,194
Faster, faster.

582
00:23:32,194 --> 00:23:33,195
There we go.

583
00:23:33,195 --> 00:23:34,196
Come on, a little faster!

584
00:23:34,196 --> 00:23:35,197
That a girl, kid.

585
00:23:35,197 --> 00:23:37,199
Right straight through the middle!

586
00:23:37,199 --> 00:23:38,200
That a girl, very good.

587
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:39,701
Just...

588
00:23:39,701 --> 00:23:40,702
Just a minute!

589
00:23:40,702 --> 00:23:42,204
I've had enough of this.

590
00:23:42,204 --> 00:23:43,705
I tell you...

591
00:23:43,705 --> 00:23:45,707
(audience laughing)

592
00:23:48,210 --> 00:23:49,211
Mr. Littlefield, please.

593
00:23:49,211 --> 00:23:50,212
Please, Mr. Littlefield.

594
00:23:50,712 --> 00:23:52,714
I think I can explain this, Mr.
Littlefield.

595
00:23:52,714 --> 00:23:53,715
So can I!

596
00:23:53,715 --> 00:23:55,217
You've got this poor girl terrified.

597
00:23:55,217 --> 00:23:56,718
She's scared to death of you.

598
00:23:56,718 --> 00:23:58,220
She's afraid of losing a second.

599
00:23:58,220 --> 00:23:59,221
Anyone can see that.

600
00:23:59,221 --> 00:24:00,222
Yeah!

601
00:24:00,222 --> 00:24:01,223
What a temper you must have.

602
00:24:01,723 --> 00:24:02,724
Yeah.

603
00:24:02,724 --> 00:24:05,727
It's one thing wearing the trousers
in the family

604
00:24:05,727 --> 00:24:07,729
but it's another being a Simon Legree

605
00:24:07,729 --> 00:24:09,231
an ogre, a... a...

606
00:24:09,231 --> 00:24:10,232
Monster.

607
00:24:10,232 --> 00:24:11,233
Yeah.

608
00:24:11,233 --> 00:24:12,234
Yeah.

609
00:24:15,237 --> 00:24:17,239
Well, maybe I have been cracking down

610
00:24:17,239 --> 00:24:18,240
a little bit too hard.

611
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:20,242
MR. LITTLEFIELD: I should say you
have.

612
00:24:20,242 --> 00:24:23,745
Now, first, we're going to get rid of
this nonsense!

613
00:24:31,253 --> 00:24:32,254
RICKY: Yes, sir.

614
00:24:32,754 --> 00:24:36,258
Being a slave driver is no way to run
a home.

615
00:24:36,258 --> 00:24:37,259
No, sir.

616
00:24:37,259 --> 00:24:38,760
But... it's the only way

617
00:24:39,261 --> 00:24:42,764
to run a nightclub, Mr. Manager.

618
00:24:42,764 --> 00:24:44,266
Mr. Manager!

619
00:24:44,266 --> 00:24:45,767
Mr. Manager!

620

Captioned by Media Access Group at
WGBH access.wgbh.org

621
00:25:03,185 --> 00:25:05,187
Mr. Littlefield was played by Gale
Gordon

622
00:25:05,687 --> 00:25:08,190
and Mrs. Littlefield was played by
Edith Meiser.


1
00:00:35,719 --> 00:00:43,226
(audience lightly laughing)

2
00:00:43,226 --> 00:00:44,728
Lucy, what are you doing?

3
00:00:46,229 --> 00:00:49,733
Honey, remember what you said to me
the first time you met me?

4
00:00:49,733 --> 00:00:51,234
I sure do.

5
00:00:51,234 --> 00:00:53,737
I said you were a cute little
chicken.

6
00:00:54,738 --> 00:00:57,240
Well, I got something to tell you

7
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:59,242
about this cute little "shicken"--

8
00:00:59,242 --> 00:01:01,745
she has crow's-feet.

9
00:01:03,246 --> 00:01:04,247
You do not.

10
00:01:05,248 --> 00:01:07,250
You don't even know what crow's-feet
are.

11
00:01:07,751 --> 00:01:08,752
I do, too.

12
00:01:08,752 --> 00:01:10,754
They're like pigeon toes.

13
00:01:10,754 --> 00:01:13,757
No, they're little lines around the
eyes.

14
00:01:13,757 --> 00:01:14,758
Come here, look.

15
00:01:16,259 --> 00:01:17,761
See?

16
00:01:17,761 --> 00:01:20,263
Oh, honey, are you kidding?

17
00:01:20,764 --> 00:01:22,265
You're beautiful.

18
00:01:23,767 --> 00:01:25,268
Aw, you're just being nice, Ricky.

19
00:01:25,268 --> 00:01:26,770
I am not.

20
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:28,271
It doesn't really bother me.

21
00:01:28,271 --> 00:01:30,774
I knew the day would come when I'd
have crow's-feet

22
00:01:31,274 --> 00:01:32,776
and your hairline started to recede

23
00:01:33,276 --> 00:01:35,779
but I just didn't expect it so soon

24
00:01:35,779 --> 00:01:37,781
that's all.

25
00:01:37,781 --> 00:01:41,284
But if you say I'm beautiful, I'll
take your word for it.

26
00:01:41,284 --> 00:01:44,788
Because after all, you're the only
one I have to please.

27
00:01:44,788 --> 00:01:46,790
All you have to do to make me happy

28
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:49,292
is say that you still love me-- do
you?

29
00:01:51,294 --> 00:01:53,797
My hairline is starting to recede,
huh?

30
00:01:53,797 --> 00:01:56,299
Oh, honey, that's just a figure of
speech.

31
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:59,302
You haven't got anything to worry
about.

32
00:01:59,302 --> 00:02:00,303
Oh, I have, too.

33
00:02:00,303 --> 00:02:02,806
I'm starting to lose my hair.

34
00:02:02,806 --> 00:02:05,308
Ricky, don't be ridiculous.

35
00:02:05,308 --> 00:02:06,810
My hairline is receding.

36
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:07,811
Look, honey, look.

37
00:02:07,811 --> 00:02:09,312
Are you crazy?

38
00:02:09,312 --> 00:02:11,815
You should have as much money as you
have hair.

39
00:02:12,315 --> 00:02:16,319
Well, I'm sure this much of my
forehead didn't show before.

40
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:17,320
You're not serious.

41
00:02:17,821 --> 00:02:19,322
If your hairline was any lower

42
00:02:19,322 --> 00:02:20,824
they'd have to bill you

43
00:02:20,824 --> 00:02:22,826
as "Ricky Ricardo, Boy Sheepdog."

44
00:02:22,826 --> 00:02:24,828
Well, it's thick enough on top

45
00:02:24,828 --> 00:02:26,329
but gee, that hairline.

46
00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:28,832
Oh, so your hairline has receded

47
00:02:28,832 --> 00:02:30,333
a quarter of an inch.

48
00:02:30,333 --> 00:02:31,334
So what?

49
00:02:31,334 --> 00:02:33,336
Quarter of an inch?

50
00:02:33,336 --> 00:02:36,339
Do you think it's that much?

51
00:02:41,845 --> 00:02:43,346
And they say women are vain.

52
00:02:43,847 --> 00:02:45,849
Vanity has nothing to do with this.

53
00:02:45,849 --> 00:02:47,851
I'm only thinking of my career.

54
00:02:47,851 --> 00:02:49,853
Oh.

55
00:02:51,855 --> 00:02:57,861
(audience laughing)

56
00:03:09,873 --> 00:03:12,375
(audience laughing)

57
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:19,883
Well, you'd make a nice fountain.

58
00:03:21,885 --> 00:03:23,386
What are you doing?

59
00:03:23,386 --> 00:03:25,889
I think it's getting thin in the
back, right here.

60
00:03:25,889 --> 00:03:27,390
It's getting thin back here in the
back.

61
00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:27,891
Oh, for heaven's sake.

62
00:03:28,391 --> 00:03:29,392
Come on to bed, baldy.

63
00:03:33,897 --> 00:03:34,898
"Baldy."

64
00:03:34,898 --> 00:03:36,399
Ay, que barbaridad.

65
00:03:36,399 --> 00:03:37,901
Tiene razon.

66
00:03:37,901 --> 00:03:40,904
Se me va a caer el pelo y me va a
llamar "Baldy".

67
00:03:40,904 --> 00:03:42,405
Como la aguila americana.

68
00:03:42,405 --> 00:03:44,407
Stop muttering in Spanish.

69
00:03:44,407 --> 00:03:45,909
I refuse.

70
00:03:45,909 --> 00:03:47,410
I won't do it.

71
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:49,913
I will not get bald!

72
00:03:49,913 --> 00:03:51,915
Well, don't talk to me.

73
00:03:51,915 --> 00:03:53,917
Speak to your scalp.

74
00:03:55,919 --> 00:03:57,420
Look, you're not losing your hair

75
00:03:57,921 --> 00:03:58,922
and even if you were

76
00:03:58,922 --> 00:04:00,423
there's nothing you can do about it.

77
00:04:00,423 --> 00:04:01,925
Yeah, I guess you're right.

78
00:04:01,925 --> 00:04:04,427
Worrying won't do it any good.

79
00:04:04,427 --> 00:04:05,929
Certainly not.

80
00:04:05,929 --> 00:04:06,930
Yeah.

81
00:04:09,432 --> 00:04:10,934
Good night, darling.

82
00:04:10,934 --> 00:04:14,437
I wonder how I'd look without any
hair.

83
00:04:14,938 --> 00:04:15,939
Ricky, good night.

84
00:04:16,439 --> 00:04:17,440
Oh... oh.

85
00:04:19,442 --> 00:04:20,443
Good night.

86
00:04:20,944 --> 00:04:21,945
Good night, honey.

87
00:04:44,968 --> 00:04:49,973
(audience laughing)

88
00:04:49,973 --> 00:04:51,975
No, no, no.

89
00:04:55,478 --> 00:04:56,980
(gasps)

90
00:05:11,778 --> 00:05:14,781
Ricky, breakfast is ready, dear!

91
00:05:14,781 --> 00:05:16,783
RICKY: Coming!

92
00:05:28,294 --> 00:05:30,797
Well, you are in a hurry.

93
00:05:30,797 --> 00:05:32,799
What are you wearing your...

94
00:05:33,299 --> 00:05:34,300
What's the matter?

95
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:36,302
You're afraid I'll steal it?

96
00:05:36,302 --> 00:05:37,303
No.

97
00:05:37,804 --> 00:05:40,306
Well, what are you wearing your hat
for?

98
00:05:40,306 --> 00:05:42,809
I thought it might rain.

99
00:05:42,809 --> 00:05:44,811
Well, now that you mention it

100
00:05:44,811 --> 00:05:47,313
the ceiling does look pretty cloudy.

101
00:05:56,322 --> 00:05:58,825
My head was cold.

102
00:06:00,827 --> 00:06:01,828
Oh.

103
00:06:05,832 --> 00:06:07,333
Besides, you never can tell

104
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:09,836
when the plaster might fall down.

105
00:06:11,337 --> 00:06:14,841
All right, all right, I'm not asking
you.

106
00:06:14,841 --> 00:06:17,343
You got any jam?

107
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:19,345
Yep.

108
00:06:27,353 --> 00:06:30,356
(audience laughing)

109
00:06:39,866 --> 00:06:41,868
Lucy, I want...

110
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:46,372
And what's the big idea of that?

111
00:06:46,372 --> 00:06:47,874
You're right

112
00:06:47,874 --> 00:06:50,376
the ceiling doesn't look any too
safe.

113
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:54,881
Is my toast ready?

114
00:06:54,881 --> 00:06:56,382
Coming up.

115
00:06:58,384 --> 00:07:07,393
(audience laughing, applause)

116
00:07:11,397 --> 00:07:13,399
Honey, take off your hat.

117
00:07:13,399 --> 00:07:17,403
I feel like I'm having breakfast in a
beanery.

118
00:07:19,405 --> 00:07:22,408
Well, what are you wearing your hat
for, anyway?

119
00:07:22,408 --> 00:07:24,911
Well, so I won't get embarrassed

120
00:07:24,911 --> 00:07:27,914
with everybody staring at my receding
hairline.

121
00:07:27,914 --> 00:07:28,915
Oh, I give up.

122
00:07:29,415 --> 00:07:31,417
And please, no more jokes about it.

123
00:07:31,417 --> 00:07:32,919
This is a serious matter.

124
00:07:32,919 --> 00:07:34,921
All right, who's making jokes?

125
00:07:34,921 --> 00:07:36,422
I'll see you later.

126
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:47,433
(audience laughing)

127
00:08:01,948 --> 00:08:03,950
Hi.

128
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:04,951
Hi, Luc.

129
00:08:05,451 --> 00:08:06,452
Hi.

130
00:08:06,452 --> 00:08:07,954
What's the matter with you?

131
00:08:07,954 --> 00:08:09,956
Oh, I was just thinking about Ricky.

132
00:08:10,456 --> 00:08:11,457
He's off on a new kick.

133
00:08:11,457 --> 00:08:12,959
He thinks he's getting bald.

134
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:14,460
Ricky?

135
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:15,461
Bald?

136
00:08:17,463 --> 00:08:19,966
Yeah, he actually thinks his hairline
is receding.

137
00:08:19,966 --> 00:08:21,467
He wore a hat at breakfast.

138
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:24,971
Wait a minute.

139
00:08:24,971 --> 00:08:26,472
It's no laughing matter, Ethel.

140
00:08:29,475 --> 00:08:31,477
I can understand how he feels

141
00:08:31,477 --> 00:08:33,980
now that my hairline has started to
recede.

142
00:08:35,982 --> 00:08:40,486
Aw, honey, your hairline isn't
starting to recede.

143
00:08:40,486 --> 00:08:41,487
Let me see.

144
00:08:41,988 --> 00:08:43,489
Turn around.

145
00:08:44,991 --> 00:08:47,493
Never mind, I got plenty hair.

146
00:08:47,493 --> 00:08:49,495
It comes way down over my eyes.

147
00:08:49,495 --> 00:08:50,997
Yeah, you better cut it.

148
00:08:50,997 --> 00:08:52,999
People will think you're a girl.

149
00:08:56,002 --> 00:08:57,503
Very comical.

150
00:08:58,504 --> 00:09:00,506
Oh, Lucy, you're kidding about Ricky.

151
00:09:00,506 --> 00:09:01,507
Why, he's got lots of hair.

152
00:09:01,507 --> 00:09:03,509
I know it, but he's got this crazy
idea

153
00:09:03,509 --> 00:09:04,510
and he believes it.

154
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:06,012
I got to snap him out of it somehow.

155
00:09:06,012 --> 00:09:07,013
How?

156
00:09:07,013 --> 00:09:09,515
Well, I thought maybe I'd invite
someone over

157
00:09:10,016 --> 00:09:11,017
that was really bald

158
00:09:11,017 --> 00:09:13,019
just to point up the comparisons.

159
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:14,520
Mmm-- that's a good idea.

160
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:15,521
FRED: Yeah.

161
00:09:15,521 --> 00:09:17,523
Now, who do we know that's bald?

162
00:09:19,025 --> 00:09:20,526
Yeah.

163
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:27,033
Fred, would you, uh...

164
00:09:27,033 --> 00:09:30,036
Would I what?

165
00:09:30,036 --> 00:09:32,538
Would you like a cup of coffee?

166
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:36,042
No, thanks.

167
00:09:36,042 --> 00:09:38,544
(laughing bitterly)

168
00:09:38,544 --> 00:09:41,547
What are you laughing at, Curly?

169
00:09:43,032 --> 00:09:45,518
I was just thinking of what Lucy's in
for.

170
00:09:46,018 --> 00:09:47,019
What?

171
00:09:47,019 --> 00:09:48,521
Well, Ricky will start trying

172
00:09:49,021 --> 00:09:51,524
one hair-restoring treatment after
another

173
00:09:51,524 --> 00:09:53,025
just like every other man

174
00:09:53,025 --> 00:09:55,027
when he thinks he's getting bald.

175
00:09:55,528 --> 00:09:56,529
What kind of treatments?

176
00:09:57,029 --> 00:09:59,532
Well, you wouldn't believe some of
them.

177
00:10:00,032 --> 00:10:01,968
Massagers, tonics, poultices

178
00:10:01,968 --> 00:10:04,320
scalp scrapers, suction devices

179
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:07,323
freezing the scalp, burning the
scalp.

180
00:10:07,323 --> 00:10:12,328
Why, a man will try anything if he
thinks he's losing his hair.

181
00:10:12,328 --> 00:10:13,329
Fred, you've given me an idea.

182
00:10:13,829 --> 00:10:15,331
I'm going to give Ricky scalp
treatments.

183
00:10:15,331 --> 00:10:16,832
And they're going to be so drastic

184
00:10:16,832 --> 00:10:18,834
that he'd be glad to forget the whole
thing.

185
00:10:18,834 --> 00:10:19,835
FRED: It won't work.

186
00:10:19,835 --> 00:10:21,337
Why not?

187
00:10:21,337 --> 00:10:23,773
Nothing has ever been invented that a
man won't try

188
00:10:23,773 --> 00:10:25,775
if he thinks he can get his hair
back.

189
00:10:25,775 --> 00:10:26,776
Oh, yeah?

190
00:10:26,776 --> 00:10:28,277
Well, you haven't heard

191
00:10:28,277 --> 00:10:30,780
of the Lucy Ricardo torture system of
hair restoring.

192
00:10:46,829 --> 00:10:47,830
(clears throat)

193
00:10:47,830 --> 00:10:49,832
Oh.

194
00:10:49,832 --> 00:10:50,833
How do you do?

195
00:10:50,833 --> 00:10:52,335
How do you do?

196
00:10:52,335 --> 00:10:53,836
I'm Mr. Thurlow, may I help you?

197
00:10:53,836 --> 00:10:55,838
Yes, I'd like to get some
preparations

198
00:10:56,339 --> 00:10:57,340
that will grow hair.

199
00:10:57,340 --> 00:10:59,342
I see-- won't you sit down?

200
00:10:59,342 --> 00:11:00,343
Thank you.

201
00:11:04,847 --> 00:11:06,349
What are you looking at me like that
for?

202
00:11:06,349 --> 00:11:07,350
Oh, it's nothing, nothing.

203
00:11:07,850 --> 00:11:10,353
Now, what did you have in mind?

204
00:11:10,353 --> 00:11:12,855
Well, my husband thinks that he's
losing his hair

205
00:11:12,855 --> 00:11:15,358
and I'd like to get several kinds of
preparations.

206
00:11:15,358 --> 00:11:16,359
I see, Mrs....?

207
00:11:16,359 --> 00:11:17,860
Ricardo.

208
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:20,863
Mrs. Ricardo, every case that comes
to my attention

209
00:11:20,863 --> 00:11:22,865
requires its own special treatment.

210
00:11:22,865 --> 00:11:23,866
Now, I can't do anything

211
00:11:24,367 --> 00:11:26,369
unless you're willing to be frank
with me.

212
00:11:26,369 --> 00:11:29,372
Just how bald are you?

213
00:11:29,372 --> 00:11:30,873
Well...

214
00:11:30,873 --> 00:11:32,875
Me?

215
00:11:32,875 --> 00:11:33,876
It isn't me.

216
00:11:33,876 --> 00:11:35,378
It's my husband.

217
00:11:35,378 --> 00:11:36,879
Oh, your husband, yes.

218
00:11:36,879 --> 00:11:37,880
Of course.

219
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:38,881
Of all the nerve.

220
00:11:39,382 --> 00:11:40,883
You think I actually came in here

221
00:11:40,883 --> 00:11:42,885
to buy all these things for myself?

222
00:11:42,885 --> 00:11:43,886
Oh, no, no, no.

223
00:11:43,886 --> 00:11:45,388
Farthest thought from my mind.

224
00:11:45,388 --> 00:11:46,389
Well, that's better.

225
00:11:46,389 --> 00:11:47,890
But...

226
00:11:47,890 --> 00:11:48,891
But what?

227
00:11:48,891 --> 00:11:49,892
Well...

228
00:11:53,396 --> 00:11:54,897
You could at least let me show you

229
00:11:54,897 --> 00:11:56,899
a more realistic- looking wig than
that.

230
00:11:58,901 --> 00:11:59,902
Wig?

231
00:11:59,902 --> 00:12:01,404
This is my own hair.

232
00:12:01,404 --> 00:12:02,405
Oh, come now.

233
00:12:02,405 --> 00:12:04,907
Well, it is-- see?

234
00:12:05,908 --> 00:12:07,910
I beg your pardon.

235
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:08,911
My goodness, so it is.

236
00:12:08,911 --> 00:12:11,414
Now, if you don't mind, would you
please show me

237
00:12:11,914 --> 00:12:13,416
some of those hair-growing things?

238
00:12:13,416 --> 00:12:14,917
What would you like?

239
00:12:14,917 --> 00:12:18,421
We have ointments, salves, creams,
tonics, scrapers

240
00:12:18,421 --> 00:12:21,424
vibrators, suction devices and
agitators.

241
00:12:21,424 --> 00:12:23,426
Would you like me to demonstrate
them?

242
00:12:23,926 --> 00:12:25,928
No, you just pick out some for me.

243
00:12:25,928 --> 00:12:27,930
Yes, madam.

244
00:12:27,930 --> 00:12:29,432
Um...

245
00:12:29,432 --> 00:12:31,934
Pick out the ones that smell the
worst and hurt the most.

246
00:12:31,934 --> 00:12:33,436
Yes, madam.

247
00:12:43,796 --> 00:12:45,798
Well, I've been waiting for you to
call me.

248
00:12:45,798 --> 00:12:47,299
How did the torture treatment work?

249
00:12:47,299 --> 00:12:49,802
Ethel, I just didn't have the nerve
to do it to him.

250
00:12:49,802 --> 00:12:52,304
You should have seen some of the
things I was going to use.

251
00:12:52,304 --> 00:12:53,305
Awful, huh?

252
00:12:53,806 --> 00:12:55,307
Yeah, there must be some less drastic
way

253
00:12:55,307 --> 00:12:56,809
to snap him out of it.

254
00:12:56,809 --> 00:12:59,278
Well, I still say your original idea
was a good one.

255
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:00,279
What was that?

256
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:02,281
Surround him with people who are
really bald

257
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:03,783
and make him realize how much hair he
has.

258
00:13:04,283 --> 00:13:05,785
Bald people-- a lot of them.

259
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:07,286
Yeah, that might work.

260
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:09,288
I'm going to give a party

261
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:13,292
and everybody there is going to be as
bald as a billiard ball.

262
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:14,794
Will you help me?

263
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:17,296
You don't expect me to shave my head,
do you?

264
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:20,299
No.

265
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:22,802
I wonder how many bald-headed men we
know?

266
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:26,806
I want this place looking like a sea
of honeydew melons.

267
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:27,807
Well, I can ask Fred and...

268
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:28,808
Wait a minute.

269
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:30,309
Why didn't I think of this before?

270
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:31,811
I know a man who can put his finger

271
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:32,812
on a hundred bald heads.

272
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:34,313
Who?

273
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:36,315
Mr. Thurlow, the hair-restorer man.

274
00:13:42,905 --> 00:13:43,906
Hi.

275
00:13:43,906 --> 00:13:44,907
Hi.

276
00:13:45,407 --> 00:13:46,408
Lucy, don't count on Fred.

277
00:13:46,408 --> 00:13:48,410
He's not coming to your bald-headed
party.

278
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:49,411
Why not?

279
00:13:49,912 --> 00:13:51,413
When I asked him, he got highly
insulted

280
00:13:51,914 --> 00:13:52,915
and stalked out of the room

281
00:13:52,915 --> 00:13:54,416
and I haven't seen him since.

282
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:55,417
Aw, too bad.

283
00:13:55,918 --> 00:13:57,419
Well, I guess we'll have enough
without him.

284
00:13:57,419 --> 00:13:58,904
Can I help you with anything?

285
00:13:58,904 --> 00:14:01,407
Yeah, honey, put some of those around
for me, will you?

286
00:14:01,407 --> 00:14:02,408
Okay.

287
00:14:02,408 --> 00:14:04,410
How did Mr. Thurlow get all those men

288
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:05,911
to come here tonight, anyway?

289
00:14:05,911 --> 00:14:08,414
Well, it seems that they all took
treatments

290
00:14:08,914 --> 00:14:09,915
at the same time

291
00:14:09,915 --> 00:14:12,418
and he told them it was a class
reunion.

292
00:14:12,418 --> 00:14:15,421
Ah, bless their little bald heads.

293
00:14:15,421 --> 00:14:16,922
(doorbell buzzes)

294
00:14:16,922 --> 00:14:18,924
There they are.

295
00:14:20,426 --> 00:14:22,428
Oh, good evening, Mr. Thurlow.

296
00:14:22,428 --> 00:14:23,929
Good evening, Mrs. Ricardo.

297
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:25,431
Come in, gentlemen.

298
00:14:28,434 --> 00:14:30,436
May I present Mr. Johnson

299
00:14:30,436 --> 00:14:31,937
Mr. Miller and Mr. Davis.

300
00:14:32,438 --> 00:14:33,939
LUCY: How do you do?

301
00:14:33,939 --> 00:14:35,441
And this is Mrs. Mertz, Mr. Thurlow.

302
00:14:35,441 --> 00:14:36,442
ETHEL: How do you do?

303
00:14:36,442 --> 00:14:37,943
THURLOW: How do you do?

304
00:14:37,943 --> 00:14:40,446
Mr. Johnson, Mr. Miller and Mr.
Davis.

305
00:14:40,446 --> 00:14:41,947
ETHEL: How do you do?

306
00:14:41,947 --> 00:14:43,449
There are six more coming.

307
00:14:43,449 --> 00:14:44,950
Oh, fine, fine.

308
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:46,952
May I take your hats, gentlemen?

309
00:14:51,457 --> 00:14:52,958
Mrs. Ricardo...

310
00:14:53,459 --> 00:14:54,460
I had a tough time

311
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:56,462
getting the boys to come.

312
00:14:56,462 --> 00:14:58,964
I had to promise you'd give them
dinner.

313
00:14:59,465 --> 00:15:00,466
Dinner?

314
00:15:00,466 --> 00:15:04,970
Oh, well, I guess we can take them
out somewhere.

315
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:05,971
And I had to promise

316
00:15:06,472 --> 00:15:08,474
you'd give them each ten dollars.

317
00:15:08,474 --> 00:15:09,975
Ten dollars?

318
00:15:10,976 --> 00:15:13,979
And there are six more coming?

319
00:15:16,982 --> 00:15:17,983
$90?

320
00:15:17,983 --> 00:15:19,985
Gee whiz.

321
00:15:20,986 --> 00:15:22,488
Well, we do have $100

322
00:15:22,488 --> 00:15:24,490
that we keep for emergencies.

323
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:26,992
Well, I guess this is an emergency.

324
00:15:27,493 --> 00:15:28,494
Pardon me.

325
00:15:43,509 --> 00:15:45,010
There you are, $90.

326
00:15:45,010 --> 00:15:46,512
Thank you, Mrs. Ricardo.

327
00:15:46,512 --> 00:15:49,014
Okay, boys, let me have your hats.

328
00:15:50,516 --> 00:15:52,518
There you are.

329
00:16:07,032 --> 00:16:09,034
Mr. Thurlow!

330
00:16:09,034 --> 00:16:11,537
Well, business hasn't been so good
lately.

331
00:16:12,037 --> 00:16:13,038
I need the ten bucks.

332
00:16:13,038 --> 00:16:14,540
Thank you.

333
00:16:16,041 --> 00:16:18,043
Sit down, gentlemen.

334
00:16:23,048 --> 00:16:25,050
All I can say is this better work.

335
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:27,052
(doorbell buzzes)

336
00:16:29,054 --> 00:16:30,055
Oh, Fred.

337
00:16:30,055 --> 00:16:31,557
Come on in.

338
00:16:31,557 --> 00:16:33,058
Hello, Lucy.

339
00:16:33,058 --> 00:16:35,060
Gee, I'm so glad you could come.

340
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:36,061
Good old Fred.

341
00:16:36,562 --> 00:16:38,063
He always comes through in a pinch.

342
00:16:38,063 --> 00:16:39,565
Aw, shucks.

343
00:16:39,565 --> 00:16:41,066
Could I have your hat, Fred?

344
00:16:41,567 --> 00:16:42,568
Yes, ma'am.

345
00:16:42,568 --> 00:16:49,074
(audience laughing)

346
00:16:49,074 --> 00:16:51,577
Well, I guess that evens things up.

347
00:16:51,577 --> 00:16:52,578
(phone rings)

348
00:16:52,578 --> 00:16:54,079
Excuse me.

349
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:55,080
Hello.

350
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,081
Hi, honey.

351
00:16:56,582 --> 00:16:57,583
LUCY (on telephone): Hi.

352
00:16:57,583 --> 00:16:59,084
I won't be able to get home.

353
00:16:59,084 --> 00:17:00,085
I got a lot of work to do.

354
00:17:00,085 --> 00:17:01,587
Oh, honey.

355
00:17:01,587 --> 00:17:03,589
Can't you just get home for a minute?

356
00:17:03,589 --> 00:17:05,591
RICKY: What for?

357
00:17:05,591 --> 00:17:07,092
Well, I have a new treatment

358
00:17:07,092 --> 00:17:08,594
I want to try on you for baldness.

359
00:17:09,094 --> 00:17:10,596
Well, it'll just have to wait.

360
00:17:10,596 --> 00:17:11,597
But it can't wait.

361
00:17:11,597 --> 00:17:13,599
It's a very expensive treatment.

362
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:17,603
Well, I'm sorry, sweetheart, but I
got a lot of work to do.

363
00:17:17,603 --> 00:17:20,105
I'll see you later, good-bye.

364
00:17:24,610 --> 00:17:26,111
Is he coming home?

365
00:17:26,111 --> 00:17:27,613
No, darn it.

366
00:17:27,613 --> 00:17:30,115
This is what I get for being so
softhearted.

367
00:17:30,115 --> 00:17:31,116
It cost me a hundred bucks.

368
00:17:31,116 --> 00:17:32,618
What now?

369
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:36,622
Torture system, here I come.

370
00:17:45,964 --> 00:17:46,965
RICKY: Lucy!

371
00:17:46,965 --> 00:17:49,468
I'm in here, dear, in the kitchen.

372
00:17:49,468 --> 00:17:54,473
(audience laughing)

373
00:17:54,473 --> 00:17:55,974
Hi, honey.

374
00:17:55,974 --> 00:17:56,975
Hi.

375
00:18:00,979 --> 00:18:02,981
Oh, a beret.

376
00:18:02,981 --> 00:18:04,983
Say, you look very continental.

377
00:18:04,983 --> 00:18:06,485
Yeah.

378
00:18:06,485 --> 00:18:07,486
What's all this stuff?

379
00:18:07,486 --> 00:18:08,987
Well, I went down to one of those

380
00:18:09,488 --> 00:18:10,489
hair-restoring places today

381
00:18:10,489 --> 00:18:12,491
and I am going to give you scalp
treatments

382
00:18:12,991 --> 00:18:13,992
to make your hair grow back.

383
00:18:13,992 --> 00:18:14,993
Scalp treatments?

384
00:18:14,993 --> 00:18:16,495
Yeah.

385
00:18:16,495 --> 00:18:17,996
Do you think these things really
work?

386
00:18:17,996 --> 00:18:19,498
They're guaranteed.

387
00:18:19,498 --> 00:18:20,499
Yeah?

388
00:18:20,499 --> 00:18:21,500
Yeah. Come on, sit down.

389
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:22,501
Let's get started.

390
00:18:22,501 --> 00:18:23,502
All right.

391
00:18:23,502 --> 00:18:25,003
Your roots won't know what hit them.

392
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:33,512
There we are.

393
00:18:35,013 --> 00:18:36,515
Now, you just relax.

394
00:18:39,518 --> 00:18:41,019
There, now...

395
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,522
First we're going to wake up your
scalp

396
00:18:43,522 --> 00:18:45,023
with a stimulating vibration.

397
00:18:45,023 --> 00:18:47,526
(vibrator whirs)

398
00:18:50,028 --> 00:18:53,532
Honey... cut it out, will you?

399
00:18:53,532 --> 00:18:57,035
Now, honey, you want to grow hair,
don't you?

400
00:18:57,035 --> 00:18:58,036
Yeah, yeah.

401
00:19:08,046 --> 00:19:10,549
Makes your whole scalp tingle,
doesn't it?

402
00:19:10,549 --> 00:19:13,552
Yeah, my head feels like it's on
fire.

403
00:19:14,052 --> 00:19:16,054
Good, that means we got your scalp on
the run.

404
00:19:16,054 --> 00:19:17,556
Now for a little brush job.

405
00:19:17,556 --> 00:19:19,057
(brush whirring)

406
00:19:30,569 --> 00:19:33,071
Are you sure you know what you're
doing?

407
00:19:33,071 --> 00:19:35,073
Yes, I read all the instructions.

408
00:19:35,073 --> 00:19:38,076
Now, this is the one that really does
the trick.

409
00:19:39,578 --> 00:19:42,581
(audience laughing)

410
00:19:49,087 --> 00:19:50,589
Honey, my eyes.

411
00:19:50,589 --> 00:19:52,090
I don't...

412
00:19:53,091 --> 00:19:55,093
My eyebrows are all right.

413
00:19:55,093 --> 00:19:57,095
I don't need any hair there.

414
00:20:09,107 --> 00:20:11,109
There, I think we're making progress.

415
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:14,112
Your scalp has a nice, red, healthy-
looking glow.

416
00:20:14,613 --> 00:20:15,614
You sure it isn't blood?

417
00:20:15,614 --> 00:20:17,115
Oh.

418
00:20:18,617 --> 00:20:20,619
Here, try this on for size.

419
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:22,621
What's this for?

420
00:20:22,621 --> 00:20:24,623
To cover the mustard plaster.

421
00:20:24,623 --> 00:20:26,625
The mustard plaster?

422
00:20:26,625 --> 00:20:30,128
Yeah, after you get the mustard
plaster on

423
00:20:30,128 --> 00:20:32,631
you wear the stocking to bed.

424
00:20:32,631 --> 00:20:34,633
I wear the stocking to bed?

425
00:20:35,133 --> 00:20:36,134
Yeah.

426
00:20:36,134 --> 00:20:39,137
Well, I don't get it, but I'll do it.

427
00:20:40,138 --> 00:20:49,648
(audience laughing)

428
00:20:53,652 --> 00:20:55,654
Oh, honey!

429
00:20:55,654 --> 00:20:58,156
Not on your foot, on your head.

430
00:20:58,156 --> 00:20:59,658
On my head?

431
00:20:59,658 --> 00:21:01,159
Yes.

432
00:21:01,159 --> 00:21:03,662
The next part of this treatment is
very gooey.

433
00:21:03,662 --> 00:21:06,164
After I get the mustard plaster on
your head

434
00:21:06,164 --> 00:21:08,667
you wear a stocking over it all
night.

435
00:21:08,667 --> 00:21:11,169
Oh... oh, I didn't know.

436
00:21:21,179 --> 00:21:24,182
Honey, it's awfully tight.

437
00:21:24,182 --> 00:21:26,685
Well, I'm sorry, that's the biggest
stocking I could find.

438
00:21:27,185 --> 00:21:28,687
(shouts)

439
00:21:28,687 --> 00:21:30,689
Honey, take it off!

440
00:21:30,689 --> 00:21:31,690
Take it off!

441
00:21:36,695 --> 00:21:39,197
I'm only doing what you told me to
do.

442
00:21:39,197 --> 00:21:40,198
Now, never mind.

443
00:21:40,198 --> 00:21:42,200
You wear it on top like a cap.

444
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,702
I'll fix it later.

445
00:21:43,702 --> 00:21:46,705
Here, now, you hold onto that.

446
00:21:46,705 --> 00:21:49,207
Leave that right there now.

447
00:21:49,207 --> 00:21:52,210
Put your neck in here and hold onto
the bowl.

448
00:21:58,216 --> 00:21:59,217
Put your head over.

449
00:21:59,217 --> 00:22:01,720
What are you putting on now?

450
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:03,722
Oil, to lubricate your scalp.

451
00:22:03,722 --> 00:22:05,223
Oh.

452
00:22:12,731 --> 00:22:13,732
What's that?

453
00:22:13,732 --> 00:22:16,234
Vinegar, to marinate your scalp.

454
00:22:30,248 --> 00:22:32,751
Eggs?

455
00:22:39,758 --> 00:22:41,259
Honey...

456
00:22:41,259 --> 00:22:43,261
What are you doing now?

457
00:22:43,261 --> 00:22:45,263
Mixing in the egg.

458
00:22:47,265 --> 00:22:49,267
Oil, vinegar, eggs...

459
00:22:49,768 --> 00:22:53,772
Why don't you put some anchovies,
make a Caesar salad?

460
00:22:57,776 --> 00:23:02,781
(audience laughing)

461
00:23:04,783 --> 00:23:06,785
What is that?

462
00:23:06,785 --> 00:23:08,286
What are you doing?

463
00:23:12,290 --> 00:23:14,292
What is that?

464
00:23:18,296 --> 00:23:19,798
(audience exclaims)

465
00:23:19,798 --> 00:23:21,800
Hey!

466
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:23,301
Hey!

467
00:23:23,301 --> 00:23:24,302
What is that?

468
00:23:24,302 --> 00:23:25,804
What are you doing?

469
00:23:26,304 --> 00:23:30,809
What's that you're doing now?

470
00:23:38,316 --> 00:23:39,818
What's that for?

471
00:23:44,322 --> 00:23:46,324
That's a heat cap.

472
00:23:46,324 --> 00:23:47,826
What's that you put on now?

473
00:23:47,826 --> 00:23:51,329
It's a heat cap, you have to bake for
20 minutes.

474
00:23:53,331 --> 00:23:55,333
Is that the end of the treatment?

475
00:23:55,333 --> 00:23:56,835
Yeah, that's it, but we have to do
that

476
00:23:57,335 --> 00:23:58,336
every other night for six months.

477
00:23:59,337 --> 00:24:00,338
Six months, huh?

478
00:24:00,839 --> 00:24:01,840
Yeah, how about that?

479
00:24:03,341 --> 00:24:06,344
Well... you know something?

480
00:24:06,344 --> 00:24:07,846
What?

481
00:24:07,846 --> 00:24:10,849
My scalp is tingling.

482
00:24:13,852 --> 00:24:15,854
I can feel something happening
already.

483
00:24:15,854 --> 00:24:18,356
Yeah? Well, you have to do it every
other night, you know.

484
00:24:18,356 --> 00:24:20,325
I think we ought to do it every
night.

485
00:24:20,826 --> 00:24:21,326
What?

486
00:24:22,327 --> 00:24:24,830
Then my hair will grow in faster.

487
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:25,831
Oh, no.

Mr. Thurlow was played by Milton
Parsons.


1
00:00:32,348 --> 00:00:33,349
Hurry up, honey.

2
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:35,351
The Littlefields will be here any
minute.

3
00:00:37,353 --> 00:00:37,854
Well, how do I look?

4
00:00:38,354 --> 00:00:39,355
Oh, you look wonderful, dear.

5
00:00:39,856 --> 00:00:41,357
Oh, fine, how could I look wonderful?

6
00:00:41,357 --> 00:00:44,861
I have on an old house dress and
haven't even done my hair.

7
00:00:44,861 --> 00:00:45,862
Well, why not?

8
00:00:45,862 --> 00:00:46,863
Well, I thought maybe

9
00:00:46,863 --> 00:00:47,864
if I didn't look too good

10
00:00:48,364 --> 00:00:49,365
it would help things along

11
00:00:49,365 --> 00:00:51,868
when you ask Mr. Littlefield for that
raise tonight.

12
00:00:51,868 --> 00:00:52,869
Now, Lucy...

13
00:00:52,869 --> 00:00:54,370
Maybe I ought to suck in my cheeks

14
00:00:54,370 --> 00:00:56,372
so he'll think we don't get enough to
eat.

15
00:00:56,372 --> 00:00:58,875
Now, you listen to me, honey...

16
00:00:58,875 --> 00:01:01,377
Hmm?

17
00:01:01,377 --> 00:01:03,379
Look, I don't want you to try

18
00:01:03,379 --> 00:01:05,882
any of your crazy stunts tonight.

19
00:01:05,882 --> 00:01:06,883
Honey, you promised me

20
00:01:06,883 --> 00:01:08,885
you were going to ask him for a
raise.

21
00:01:08,885 --> 00:01:10,386
I will, I will!

22
00:01:10,386 --> 00:01:12,388
I just don't want you to go pushing
me into it.

23
00:01:12,388 --> 00:01:14,891
Ricky, if you're afraid to ask for a
raise

24
00:01:14,891 --> 00:01:16,392
you're never going to get it.

25
00:01:16,392 --> 00:01:17,894
I'm not afraid; I'll do it.

26
00:01:17,894 --> 00:01:19,395
Well, what are you going to say?

27
00:01:19,395 --> 00:01:20,396
Let's rehearse.

28
00:01:20,897 --> 00:01:21,898
Rehearse?

29
00:01:21,898 --> 00:01:23,399
Sure.

00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:25,902
You can't leave a thing like this to
chance.

31
00:01:25,902 --> 00:01:27,904
Now, look, I'll pretend I'm Mr.
Littlefield

32
00:01:27,904 --> 00:01:28,905
and you pretend you're you.

33
00:01:28,905 --> 00:01:30,406
Now, we've finished dinner.

34
00:01:30,406 --> 00:01:31,407
Mr. Littlefield is full of food

35
00:01:31,908 --> 00:01:33,910
and he's leaning back, weak, bloated
and vulnerable.

36
00:01:34,410 --> 00:01:37,413
(imitating groans of comfort)

37
00:01:37,413 --> 00:01:41,918
(imitating Littlefield): Ricardo, my
boy, your wife sure is a good cook.

38
00:01:41,918 --> 00:01:45,421
Go ahead, Ricky, here's where you
speak up.

39
00:01:45,421 --> 00:01:48,925
Uh... uh...

40
00:01:48,925 --> 00:01:50,927
Mr. Littlefield...

41
00:01:50,927 --> 00:01:53,429
Yes, my boy, what's on your mind?

42
00:01:53,429 --> 00:01:57,433
Uh... I was wondering...

43
00:01:57,433 --> 00:01:59,435
Yes?

44
00:02:01,437 --> 00:02:04,941
You couldn't give me any more money
next year, could you?

45
00:02:08,444 --> 00:02:10,446
Well, that ought to sweep him off his
feet.

46
00:02:10,446 --> 00:02:12,448
Honey, if he wants to give me a raise

47
00:02:12,448 --> 00:02:13,950
that will do it.

48
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:16,452
Honey, nobody ever wants to give
anybody a raise.

49
00:02:16,452 --> 00:02:17,954
You have to demand it.

50
00:02:18,454 --> 00:02:19,956
Now, look, you be Mr. Littlefield

51
00:02:19,956 --> 00:02:22,458
and I'll be you-- go ahead, sit down.

52
00:02:22,458 --> 00:02:23,459
You're Mr. Littlefield.

53
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:24,961
All right.

54
00:02:24,961 --> 00:02:25,962
(sighs contentedly)

55
00:02:25,962 --> 00:02:30,967
My boy, that was a good meal.

56
00:02:30,967 --> 00:02:31,968
Well, Mr. Littlefield

57
00:02:31,968 --> 00:02:34,470
I want to talk to you about my new
contract.

58
00:02:34,971 --> 00:02:37,473
How much of a raise am I getting?

59
00:02:37,473 --> 00:02:38,474
How much?

60
00:02:38,474 --> 00:02:40,476
Yes, how much?

61
00:02:40,977 --> 00:02:41,978
You know, Mr. Littlefield

62
00:02:42,478 --> 00:02:43,980
I have to decide whether to stay with
you

63
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:45,982
or accept one of my many other
offers.

64
00:02:45,982 --> 00:02:47,483
I don't have any other offers.

65
00:02:47,483 --> 00:02:49,485
Oh, well, honey, I know that

66
00:02:49,485 --> 00:02:51,487
but Mr. Littlefield doesn't know it.

67
00:02:51,487 --> 00:02:52,989
Now put yourself in his place.

68
00:02:53,489 --> 00:02:55,491
Think-- how would you react,
honestly?

69
00:02:55,491 --> 00:02:56,993
Well, Mr. Littlefield

70
00:02:56,993 --> 00:02:58,995
are you going to top those other
offers

71
00:02:58,995 --> 00:03:00,496
or do I quit?

72
00:03:00,496 --> 00:03:01,497
What do you say?

73
00:03:01,998 --> 00:03:02,999
Don't quit, my boy.

74
00:03:02,999 --> 00:03:04,500
I'll give you the raise.

75
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:05,501
See?

76
00:03:05,501 --> 00:03:06,502
Hey, I got the raise!

77
00:03:06,502 --> 00:03:07,503
That's right.

78
00:03:07,503 --> 00:03:09,005
(laughs)

79
00:03:09,005 --> 00:03:10,506
What do you know?

80
00:03:10,506 --> 00:03:12,508
How about that?

81
00:03:12,508 --> 00:03:14,510
Yeah...

82
00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:16,012
I just hope the Littlefield

83
00:03:16,012 --> 00:03:17,013
sees thins that lowgically.

84
00:03:17,513 --> 00:03:18,514
Don't worry;

85
00:03:18,514 --> 00:03:20,516
he'll see "thins" that "lowgically."

86
00:03:21,517 --> 00:03:23,019
Come on, let's go into the parlor

87
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:24,520
and wait for the fly.

88
00:03:31,611 --> 00:03:33,613
(sighs contentedly)

89
00:03:33,613 --> 00:03:35,615
Oh, that was a wonderful dinner.

90
00:03:36,115 --> 00:03:38,618
Your wife certainly knows how to
cook, Ricky.

91
00:03:38,618 --> 00:03:40,119
Oh, thank you.

92
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:41,621
Phoebe, I want you to get

93
00:03:41,621 --> 00:03:43,122
Mrs. Ricardo's recipe for that
cheesecake.

94
00:03:43,623 --> 00:03:44,624
It was delicious.

95
00:03:45,124 --> 00:03:47,126
Yes, Alvin, I'd love it, Lucy, if
you'll give it to me.

96
00:03:47,627 --> 00:03:48,628
Oh, I'd be glad to.

97
00:03:48,628 --> 00:03:50,129
I'll write it out before you leave.

98
00:04:05,645 --> 00:04:07,146
Did you say something?

99
00:04:07,146 --> 00:04:09,649
No, no, but Ricky has something to
ask you

100
00:04:10,149 --> 00:04:11,651
don't you, dear?

101
00:04:11,651 --> 00:04:13,653
Uh...

102
00:04:13,653 --> 00:04:16,656
Oh, no, not really, it can wait.

103
00:04:16,656 --> 00:04:18,157
No, go ahead, dear.

104
00:04:18,157 --> 00:04:20,159
Yes, Ricky, what is it?

105
00:04:20,159 --> 00:04:21,661
Well, um...

106
00:04:22,161 --> 00:04:23,162
Mr. Littlefield...

107
00:04:23,663 --> 00:04:25,164
Yes?

108
00:04:25,164 --> 00:04:27,166
(not verbalizing)

109
00:04:28,668 --> 00:04:30,169
Mr. Littlefield, you and I

110
00:04:30,169 --> 00:04:33,172
are going to have to have a talk very
soon

111
00:04:33,172 --> 00:04:35,174
about my new contract.

112
00:04:37,176 --> 00:04:39,679
And there's one thing I have to know

113
00:04:39,679 --> 00:04:42,181
and I have to know it right away.

114
00:04:42,181 --> 00:04:43,182
What's that?

115
00:04:45,184 --> 00:04:46,185
You couldn't give me

116
00:04:46,185 --> 00:04:47,687
any more money next year, could you?

117
00:04:54,193 --> 00:04:55,695
Well...

118
00:04:55,695 --> 00:04:57,697
as a matter of fact, Ricky

119
00:04:57,697 --> 00:05:01,200
I've been thinking over the idea of
giving you a raise.

120
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,201
Yes?

121
00:05:02,201 --> 00:05:03,703
And my boy...

122
00:05:03,703 --> 00:05:05,204
it's out of the question.

123
00:05:06,205 --> 00:05:07,206
Why?

124
00:05:07,707 --> 00:05:10,209
The nightclub business isn't what it
used to be--

125
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:12,211
taxes have come up, things are more
expensive.

126
00:05:12,211 --> 00:05:14,213
So you can see that I'm in no
position

127
00:05:14,213 --> 00:05:15,214
to give you any more money.

128
00:05:15,214 --> 00:05:16,215
Oh, yes, sir, absolutely

129
00:05:16,215 --> 00:05:17,717
it's out of the question.

130
00:05:17,717 --> 00:05:19,218
You want any more coffee, Mrs.
Littlefield?

131
00:05:19,719 --> 00:05:21,721
Well, Ricky, I guess you're just
going to have to accept

132
00:05:21,721 --> 00:05:23,222
one of those other offers then.

133
00:05:23,222 --> 00:05:25,224
(screams)

134
00:05:26,726 --> 00:05:28,227
"Other offers"?

135
00:05:28,227 --> 00:05:30,229
Yes, Ricky wasn't going to say
anything--

136
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:32,231
he's so loyal, you know--

137
00:05:32,231 --> 00:05:35,234
but other clubs have been clamoring
for him.

138
00:05:35,234 --> 00:05:36,235
Really?

139
00:05:36,736 --> 00:05:37,737
Oh, I wouldn't say...

140
00:05:38,237 --> 00:05:40,239
Just the other day a club owner
called--

141
00:05:40,239 --> 00:05:41,741
I won't mention any names--

142
00:05:42,241 --> 00:05:44,243
and offered Ricky twice as much money

143
00:05:44,243 --> 00:05:45,745
as you're paying him.

144
00:05:45,745 --> 00:05:47,246
It wasn't twice as much.

145
00:05:47,246 --> 00:05:50,249
Oh, no, that's right, it was three
times as much.

146
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:53,753
But Ricky said, "No, no, if it's at
all possible

147
00:05:53,753 --> 00:05:57,256
I want to stay with good old Mr.
Littlefield."

148
00:05:57,256 --> 00:05:58,758
Didn't you, Ricky?

149
00:05:58,758 --> 00:05:59,759
Oh, yes, yeah, yeah--

150
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:00,760
my zact words.

151
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:02,261
His "zact" words.

152
00:06:04,764 --> 00:06:06,265
Well, that's very flattering.

153
00:06:06,766 --> 00:06:08,267
You understand, Mr. Littlefield

154
00:06:08,768 --> 00:06:09,769
I don't want to leave.

155
00:06:10,269 --> 00:06:12,271
I want to stay right where I am.

156
00:06:12,271 --> 00:06:14,774
I don't want to go anyplace, you
know.

157
00:06:14,774 --> 00:06:15,775
I'm happy there.

158
00:06:16,275 --> 00:06:17,276
But the people--

159
00:06:17,276 --> 00:06:18,778
they're offering me so much money

160
00:06:18,778 --> 00:06:20,279
I mean, I, uh...

161
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:21,781
I don't know what else to do, you
know.

162
00:06:21,781 --> 00:06:23,282
I see, I see your problem.

163
00:06:23,282 --> 00:06:26,786
Uh, how many such offers have you
had?

164
00:06:26,786 --> 00:06:28,287
Four.
Twelve.

165
00:06:29,288 --> 00:06:30,289
Um...

166
00:06:30,289 --> 00:06:32,291
I got eight more this morning.

167
00:06:32,291 --> 00:06:34,794
Oh...

168
00:06:34,794 --> 00:06:37,296
Well, Mr. Littlefield?

169
00:06:37,296 --> 00:06:40,299
Oh, this is a very difficult
decision.

170
00:06:52,812 --> 00:06:54,313
Very difficult, very difficult.

171
00:06:55,815 --> 00:06:58,317
You've been wonderful for the
Tropicana.

172
00:06:58,317 --> 00:07:01,821
We have a fine personal
relationship...

173
00:07:02,321 --> 00:07:03,322
Yes?

174
00:07:03,322 --> 00:07:05,324
I can't stand in your way, my boy.

175
00:07:05,324 --> 00:07:06,826
Take one of those other offers.

176
00:07:06,826 --> 00:07:07,827
Onward and upward

177
00:07:07,827 --> 00:07:09,829
and you'll get to the top of the
heap.

178
00:07:10,329 --> 00:07:13,332
But Mr. Littlefield, you don't
understand.

179
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:15,334
If you don't give Ricky that raise

180
00:07:15,334 --> 00:07:16,836
you'll lose him, he'll quit.

181
00:07:17,336 --> 00:07:18,838
I understand perfectly.

182
00:07:18,838 --> 00:07:19,839
Oh, you do?

183
00:07:22,341 --> 00:07:25,344
We'll give him one more chance, dear.

184
00:07:25,344 --> 00:07:26,345
Uh... Mr. Littlefield

185
00:07:26,846 --> 00:07:28,848
are you sure you don't want to change
your mind

186
00:07:28,848 --> 00:07:30,850
and snap him up before it's too late?

187
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:31,851
No.

188
00:07:31,851 --> 00:07:32,852
No?

189
00:07:32,852 --> 00:07:33,853
No?

190
00:07:33,853 --> 00:07:35,354
No! N-O.

191
00:07:35,855 --> 00:07:39,358
All right, I quit. K-W-I-T!

192
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,361
All right.

193
00:07:42,361 --> 00:07:43,362
All right.

194
00:07:43,362 --> 00:07:44,363
All right.

195
00:07:44,363 --> 00:07:45,364
All right!

196
00:07:45,364 --> 00:07:47,867
And don't think you're going to get
my recipe

197
00:07:47,867 --> 00:07:49,368
for cheesecake, either!

198
00:07:49,368 --> 00:07:50,236
What?

199
00:07:53,573 --> 00:07:55,575
Lucy, what's the meaning of this?

200
00:07:55,575 --> 00:07:56,576
What?

201
00:07:56,576 --> 00:07:58,578
This ad in the paper says

202
00:07:58,578 --> 00:08:00,580
that Xavier Valdez and his orchestra

203
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:03,082
are opening at the Tropicana Club
Thursday night.

204
00:08:03,082 --> 00:08:04,584
Isn't Ricky there anymore?

205
00:08:04,584 --> 00:08:07,086
No, thanks to a certain big-mouth
redhead.

206
00:08:07,086 --> 00:08:08,588
What are you talking about?

207
00:08:09,088 --> 00:08:10,089
Well, the other night

208
00:08:10,089 --> 00:08:11,591
Ricky told Mr. Littlefield

209
00:08:11,591 --> 00:08:14,093
that he had to have a raise or he'd
quit

210
00:08:14,093 --> 00:08:15,595
and I egged him onto it.

211
00:08:15,595 --> 00:08:16,596
And?

212
00:08:17,096 --> 00:08:19,098
That was some of the rottenest egging
I ever did.

213
00:08:19,098 --> 00:08:21,601
Oh, Lucy, how's Ricky taking it?

214
00:08:22,101 --> 00:08:23,102
Just terrible-- he's done nothing

215
00:08:23,102 --> 00:08:25,104
but mope around the house for two
days--

216
00:08:25,104 --> 00:08:26,606
won't even get out of his pajamas.

217
00:08:26,606 --> 00:08:28,107
Hi, Ethel.

218
00:08:28,608 --> 00:08:29,108
Oh, hi, Ricky.

219
00:08:29,609 --> 00:08:30,610
I'll get your breakfast.

220
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:31,611
No, no, thank you, thank you.

221
00:08:31,611 --> 00:08:32,612
I want to get downtown.

222
00:08:32,612 --> 00:08:34,614
Oh, that's the spirit, Ricky.

223
00:08:34,614 --> 00:08:37,116
Don't let this get you down-- get out
and fight.

224
00:08:37,116 --> 00:08:40,119
You'll be bringing home a check again
any day now.

225
00:08:40,119 --> 00:08:41,120
That's right; I'm on my way

226
00:08:41,621 --> 00:08:43,623
to the unemployment office right now.

227
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:50,129
Well, how does it feel to be married
to an also-been?

228
00:08:54,634 --> 00:08:56,636
An "also-been"?

229
00:08:56,636 --> 00:08:58,137
He means a has-ran.

230
00:09:00,139 --> 00:09:02,141
Gee, it's pitiful, Ethel.

231
00:09:02,141 --> 00:09:04,644
I got to do something about getting
his job back.

232
00:09:04,644 --> 00:09:07,146
Well, maybe this Xavier Valdez won't
work out

233
00:09:07,146 --> 00:09:09,148
and Mr. Littlefield will be forced

234
00:09:09,649 --> 00:09:11,651
to ask Ricky to come back again.

235
00:09:11,651 --> 00:09:13,152
Wouldn't it be wonderful

236
00:09:13,152 --> 00:09:15,655
if nobody showed up for Xavier's
opening?

237
00:09:15,655 --> 00:09:17,156
It would take a miracle, though.

238
00:09:17,657 --> 00:09:18,658
Yeah...

239
00:09:18,658 --> 00:09:19,659
Wait a minute!

240
00:09:19,659 --> 00:09:21,160
What?

241
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:22,662
I feel a miracle coming on!

242
00:09:23,162 --> 00:09:24,163
What do you mean?

243
00:09:24,163 --> 00:09:26,666
Listen, there are 75 tables at the
Tropicana.

244
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:29,168
What if I called as 75 different
people

245
00:09:29,168 --> 00:09:30,670
and made 75 reservations

246
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:33,172
and then at the last minute got 75
headaches

247
00:09:33,172 --> 00:09:34,674
and couldn't make it?

248
00:09:34,674 --> 00:09:37,176
Hey, that might work out.

249
00:09:37,176 --> 00:09:38,678
Sure, the place would be empty.

250
00:09:39,178 --> 00:09:40,680
I'm going to call the Tropicana right
now.

251
00:09:46,185 --> 00:09:49,689
(phone rings)

252
00:09:49,689 --> 00:09:51,691
Tropicana Club.

253
00:09:52,191 --> 00:09:55,695
(in high-toned accent): Hello, this
is Mrs. Worthington Proudfoot.

254
00:09:55,695 --> 00:09:58,197
I'd like to make a reservation for
Thursday evening.

255
00:09:58,698 --> 00:10:00,199
Oh, fine, Mrs. Proudfoot.

256
00:10:00,199 --> 00:10:02,201
You are our first reservation.

257
00:10:02,201 --> 00:10:03,703
Oh, how charming.

258
00:10:03,703 --> 00:10:05,204
Charming, yes.

259
00:10:05,204 --> 00:10:07,206
I'd like a table for eight, please.

260
00:10:07,707 --> 00:10:08,708
Yes...

261
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:10,209
Yes, you're welcome.

262
00:10:10,209 --> 00:10:11,210
(giggling)

263
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:12,211
It worked!

264
00:10:12,211 --> 00:10:13,212
Who'll I be now?

265
00:10:13,713 --> 00:10:15,214
Say, listen, Ethel, why don't you go
down

266
00:10:15,214 --> 00:10:16,716
and make reservations on your phone?

267
00:10:16,716 --> 00:10:18,217
That way we'll tie up the line

268
00:10:18,217 --> 00:10:20,219
and nobody else will be able to get a
table.

269
00:10:20,219 --> 00:10:21,220
That's a good idea.

270
00:10:21,721 --> 00:10:23,222
Okay, I think I'll be a celebrity
this time.

271
00:10:23,723 --> 00:10:24,724
I'll check with you later.

272
00:10:24,724 --> 00:10:25,725
Okay, honey.

273
00:10:30,229 --> 00:10:32,732
(imitating Tallulah Bankhead): Hello,
Tropicana, darling?

274
00:10:33,232 --> 00:10:35,234
I'd like a reservation for Thursday,
darling.

275
00:10:35,234 --> 00:10:37,236
Yes, I'd like one of those darling
little tables

276
00:10:37,236 --> 00:10:39,739
underneath those darling little palm
trees, darling.

277
00:10:42,441 --> 00:10:43,442
Yes, good-bye.

278
00:10:43,442 --> 00:10:44,944
(phone ringing)

279
00:10:44,944 --> 00:10:46,946
Hello, Tropicana.

280
00:10:46,946 --> 00:10:49,949
Yes, we have a nice table for two.

281
00:10:49,949 --> 00:10:50,950
De la chopa.

282
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:51,951
Thank you.

283
00:10:51,951 --> 00:10:53,452
(phone rings)

284
00:10:53,452 --> 00:10:54,954
Hello, Tropicana.

285
00:10:54,954 --> 00:10:55,955
Yes, Mrs. Thompson.

286
00:10:56,455 --> 00:10:56,956
(phone rings)

287
00:10:57,456 --> 00:10:58,457
J-just one minute, please.

288
00:10:58,457 --> 00:11:01,460
Hello, Mrs. Bennett?

289
00:11:01,961 --> 00:11:03,963
Y-yes, would you hold for a second,
please?

290
00:11:04,463 --> 00:11:06,465
Yes, Mrs. Thompson.

291
00:11:06,465 --> 00:11:09,969
All right, Mrs. Bennett, all right,
all right.

292
00:11:09,969 --> 00:11:13,472
That's right, that's four at 8:00.

293
00:11:13,472 --> 00:11:15,474
Eight at 10:00.

294
00:11:15,474 --> 00:11:16,976
Ten at...

295
00:11:16,976 --> 00:11:18,978
Oh... sorry... I'm very sorry.

296
00:11:18,978 --> 00:11:20,479
I'm very sorry...

297
00:11:20,479 --> 00:11:22,481
No, I didn't mean you.

298
00:11:22,481 --> 00:11:25,484
Mrs., uh, Mrs., uh...

299
00:11:25,985 --> 00:11:27,486
Oh! Mon dieu!

300
00:11:27,486 --> 00:11:30,489
(groaning in French)

301
00:11:30,489 --> 00:11:33,993
Thank you. Thank you very much.

302
00:11:33,993 --> 00:11:36,495
We'd be delighted to see you.

303
00:11:36,996 --> 00:11:38,998
Good-bye.

304
00:11:45,004 --> 00:11:47,506
Well, how's everything going,
Maurice?

305
00:11:47,506 --> 00:11:49,508
It's amazing, Mr. Littlefield.

306
00:11:50,009 --> 00:11:52,511
We opened the book for reservations
two hours ago

307
00:11:53,012 --> 00:11:55,514
and we are completely, completely
sold out.

308
00:11:55,514 --> 00:11:57,016
Splendid, splendid.

309
00:11:57,016 --> 00:11:58,517
I cannot understand it.

310
00:11:58,517 --> 00:12:01,020
This is the first time this has
happened

311
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:02,521
in the history of the club.

312
00:12:02,521 --> 00:12:04,023
It's quite clear to me:

313
00:12:04,023 --> 00:12:06,025
I finally hired someone with talent.

314
00:12:06,025 --> 00:12:07,526
(phone rings)

315
00:12:10,029 --> 00:12:12,531
Hello, Tropicana Club.

316
00:12:12,531 --> 00:12:17,536
No, I'm very, very sorry, we are all
booked up

317
00:12:17,536 --> 00:12:19,538
we are completely sold out.

318
00:12:19,538 --> 00:12:21,040
(laughing): Yes, yes.

319
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:24,543
But it's impossible, madame, that's
impossible.

320
00:12:25,044 --> 00:12:28,047
(in southern accent): Oh, well, are
you sure

321
00:12:28,047 --> 00:12:30,549
that you don't have just one little
table

322
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:32,051
for Scarlet Culpepper?

323
00:12:32,551 --> 00:12:35,554
Oh, well, I am sorry.

324
00:12:35,554 --> 00:12:36,555
Is that so?

325
00:12:36,555 --> 00:12:38,057
Well, I declare.

326
00:12:38,557 --> 00:12:39,558
Well, bye now.

327
00:12:39,558 --> 00:12:41,560
Whew!

328
00:12:45,064 --> 00:12:47,066
(groans)

329
00:12:47,066 --> 00:12:49,068
Oh, brother...

330
00:12:49,068 --> 00:12:51,570
I can't make one more phone call.

331
00:12:52,071 --> 00:12:55,074
My finger's all worn down to a nub.

332
00:12:55,074 --> 00:12:57,076
You won't have to, they're all sold
out.

333
00:12:57,076 --> 00:12:58,577
Good.

334
00:12:58,577 --> 00:13:01,580
Harry and Bess Truman got the last
table.

335
00:13:06,585 --> 00:13:09,588
Hey, this'll make Ricky look pretty
good, huh, Fred?

336
00:13:10,089 --> 00:13:12,091
Well, I don't know if it will make
Ricky look good

337
00:13:12,091 --> 00:13:14,093
but it will certainly make the other
guy look bad.

338
00:13:14,093 --> 00:13:17,096
Hey, that's right, Ethel.

339
00:13:17,096 --> 00:13:19,598
We have to make Mr. Littlefield
realize

340
00:13:19,598 --> 00:13:22,101
that those people aren't showing up

341
00:13:22,101 --> 00:13:24,103
because Ricky Ricardo isn't there.

342
00:13:24,103 --> 00:13:26,105
Oh, yeah.

343
00:13:26,105 --> 00:13:27,606
How?

344
00:13:27,606 --> 00:13:29,108
Gee, I don't know.

345
00:13:29,108 --> 00:13:31,610
I guess we'll just have to go in and
sit down at the table

346
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:32,611
and then everybody get up and walk
out

347
00:13:33,112 --> 00:13:34,613
when we find out Ricky isn't playing
there.

348
00:13:34,613 --> 00:13:37,116
Oh, no, we'd be recognized.

349
00:13:37,116 --> 00:13:38,617
Well, not necessarily.

350
00:13:38,617 --> 00:13:40,119
Depends on how we're fixed up.

351
00:13:40,619 --> 00:13:42,621
Sure, we could all be disguised.

352
00:13:42,621 --> 00:13:43,622
Yeah.

353
00:13:44,123 --> 00:13:46,125
But, Lucy, one table of people
walking out

354
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:48,127
isn't going to mean anything.

355
00:13:48,127 --> 00:13:50,129
Well, maybe we could go out and come
back

356
00:13:50,129 --> 00:13:51,630
a couple of times or something.

357
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:52,631
How?

358
00:13:52,631 --> 00:13:53,632
Well...

359
00:13:53,632 --> 00:13:54,633
Wait a minute.

360
00:13:54,633 --> 00:13:55,634
What?

361
00:13:56,135 --> 00:13:58,137
I got a pal that's a quick-change
artist.

362
00:13:58,137 --> 00:13:59,138
Hal King!

363
00:13:59,138 --> 00:14:00,639
Yeah, and I'll bet

364
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:02,141
he'd let us borrow all his trick
wardrobe.

365
00:14:02,141 --> 00:14:03,642
Well, call him up!

366
00:14:03,642 --> 00:14:05,144
What are you waiting for? Come on!

367
00:14:22,094 --> 00:14:23,596
Well...

368
00:14:24,096 --> 00:14:25,097
everything all set?

369
00:14:25,097 --> 00:14:27,099
Yes, sir, everything is fine.

370
00:14:27,099 --> 00:14:29,101
Ah, wonderful, wonderful.

371
00:14:29,101 --> 00:14:31,604
In a few moments, this room will be
filled

372
00:14:32,104 --> 00:14:35,107
with 300 jolly, fun-seeking,
money-spending revelers.

373
00:14:36,609 --> 00:14:39,612
Psst, psst, they're beginning to
arrive.

374
00:14:58,631 --> 00:15:00,633
Good evening.

375
00:15:00,633 --> 00:15:01,634
Good evening.

376
00:15:01,634 --> 00:15:03,135
Do you have a reservation?

377
00:15:03,636 --> 00:15:07,139
(in high-toned accent): Mrs.
Worthington Proudfoot and party.

378
00:15:09,141 --> 00:15:11,143
Oh, yes, yes.
table 29.

379
00:15:11,143 --> 00:15:12,645
Yes, yes.

380
00:15:12,645 --> 00:15:14,146
This way, please.

381
00:15:14,146 --> 00:15:15,648
Charming place.

382
00:15:15,648 --> 00:15:17,650
They changed the decor here.

383
00:15:32,164 --> 00:15:34,166
Is, uh, this satisfactory?

384
00:15:34,166 --> 00:15:36,669
Oh, yes, everything's fine, thank
you.

385
00:15:36,669 --> 00:15:39,171
You know, my dear, you're going to be
very impressed

386
00:15:39,171 --> 00:15:41,173
with this chap Ricky Ricardo.

387
00:15:41,173 --> 00:15:43,175
Very remarkable chap, Ricky Ricardo.

388
00:15:43,175 --> 00:15:44,677
Oh, I'm sorry, madame.

389
00:15:44,677 --> 00:15:45,678
What about?

390
00:15:46,178 --> 00:15:47,680
Uh, Ricky...

391
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:50,683
Yes, Ricky Ricardo is not here
anymore.

392
00:15:50,683 --> 00:15:52,685
Oh, but we have

393
00:15:53,185 --> 00:15:55,688
that world-famous entertainer Xavier
Valdez.

394
00:15:55,688 --> 00:15:58,190
No Ricky Ricardo?!

395
00:15:58,691 --> 00:16:02,194
But we only came here to hear Ricky
Ricardo.

396
00:16:02,194 --> 00:16:03,696
Certainement.

397
00:16:03,696 --> 00:16:07,199
If the Ricardo chap isn't here, we
may as well pop off.

398
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:08,701
Indeed.

399
00:16:11,704 --> 00:16:13,706
Um, um...

400
00:16:13,706 --> 00:16:15,207
(stammering)

401
00:16:15,207 --> 00:16:17,209
Oh, please, please, wait.

402
00:16:17,209 --> 00:16:19,211
You'll enjoy Xavier Valdez.

403
00:16:19,211 --> 00:16:21,714
He's a lot more clever than Ricky
Ricardo.

404
00:16:21,714 --> 00:16:23,215
Please!

405
00:16:25,718 --> 00:16:27,219
Really...

406
00:16:27,219 --> 00:16:30,723
no one is more clever than Ricky
Ricardo, peasant.

407
00:17:09,261 --> 00:17:10,763
Where is everybody?!

408
00:17:11,263 --> 00:17:12,264
Well, I don't know.

409
00:17:12,264 --> 00:17:14,767
There was that one group over there

410
00:17:14,767 --> 00:17:15,768
but they walked out.

411
00:17:16,268 --> 00:17:18,270
Yes, yes, I know, I know.

412
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:30,783
MAURICE: Good evening.

413
00:17:30,783 --> 00:17:35,788
(in English accent): Mrs. Miriam
Chumley and party.

414
00:17:37,289 --> 00:17:41,293
Oh, certainly, table 27.

415
00:17:41,293 --> 00:17:42,795
Ah, this way, please.

416
00:17:44,797 --> 00:17:45,798
Good evening.

417
00:17:45,798 --> 00:17:47,299
Righto, righto.

418
00:18:04,817 --> 00:18:06,819
(in New York accent): Hiya.

419
00:18:06,819 --> 00:18:07,820
Good evening.

420
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,823
The rest of my party ain't here yet.

421
00:18:11,323 --> 00:18:13,826
Do you have a reservation?

422
00:18:13,826 --> 00:18:15,828
Do I have a reservation?

423
00:18:15,828 --> 00:18:18,330
Of course I have a reservation.

424
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:20,332
17 people, that's all.

425
00:18:20,332 --> 00:18:21,834
MacGillicuddy.

426
00:18:23,836 --> 00:18:24,837
MacGillicuddy...

427
00:18:25,337 --> 00:18:26,338
Miss MacGillicuddy.

428
00:18:26,338 --> 00:18:27,840
Oh! Yes, indeed, yes.

429
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:29,842
Maurice, Maurice!

430
00:18:29,842 --> 00:18:32,344
Miss MacGillicuddy's table, number
11.

431
00:18:32,344 --> 00:18:34,847
The rest of her party will be here
shortly.

432
00:18:35,347 --> 00:18:36,849
This way, please, Miss MacGillicuddy.

433
00:18:36,849 --> 00:18:37,850
Hiya, Maury.

434
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:38,851
Fine, thank you.

435
00:18:38,851 --> 00:18:39,852
How are you?

436
00:18:39,852 --> 00:18:40,853
Fine.

437
00:18:40,853 --> 00:18:41,854
This is your table right here.

438
00:18:41,854 --> 00:18:42,855
I guess I'm a little early.

439
00:18:43,355 --> 00:18:44,356
This is my favorite club.

440
00:18:44,356 --> 00:18:45,357
You always put on a good show here.

441
00:18:45,858 --> 00:18:46,358
I always say that.

442
00:18:46,859 --> 00:18:47,860
I always tell everybody that.

443
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:48,861
You should hear me.

444
00:18:48,861 --> 00:18:51,363
I always say, "You never get let down

445
00:18:51,363 --> 00:18:53,365
if you go and see Ricky Ricardo."

446
00:18:53,365 --> 00:18:54,867
That's what I always say.

447
00:18:54,867 --> 00:18:57,870
But, uh, Ricky Ricardo is not here
anymore.

448
00:18:58,871 --> 00:19:01,874
Ricky Ricardo ain't here no more?!

449
00:19:01,874 --> 00:19:04,877
Well, I'm getting out of this crummy
dump.

450
00:19:05,377 --> 00:19:06,879
Oh, but if you please...

451
00:19:07,379 --> 00:19:08,881
Please, save your breath.

452
00:19:09,381 --> 00:19:10,883
I beg your pardon.

453
00:19:10,883 --> 00:19:12,384
Did I hear you say

454
00:19:12,384 --> 00:19:14,887
that Ricky Ricardo isn't here
anymore?

455
00:19:15,387 --> 00:19:16,388
Yeah, how do you like that?

456
00:19:16,388 --> 00:19:17,890
Well, I don't like it at all.

457
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:19,391
Oh, please, please, please

458
00:19:19,391 --> 00:19:20,392
I assure you if you stay

459
00:19:20,392 --> 00:19:21,894
you won't be disappointed.

460
00:19:21,894 --> 00:19:22,895
Ha!

461
00:19:24,396 --> 00:19:26,398
My good man, is Ricky Ricardo

462
00:19:26,398 --> 00:19:28,901
appearing here tonight or not?

463
00:19:28,901 --> 00:19:30,903
Well... no.

464
00:19:30,903 --> 00:19:32,404
That's all.

465
00:19:32,404 --> 00:19:34,406
Let me use your telephone.

466
00:19:36,408 --> 00:19:39,411
LITTLEFIELD: Please, Mrs. Chumley,
no, if you just...

467
00:19:39,912 --> 00:19:41,914
Say, buster, who's the stupe

468
00:19:41,914 --> 00:19:44,917
that let Ricky Ricardo slip through
his fingers?

469
00:19:44,917 --> 00:19:46,418
You?

470
00:19:46,418 --> 00:19:48,921
Well... yes.

471
00:19:48,921 --> 00:19:49,922
Oh, brother.

472
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:53,425
Hello, Mary, this is Miriam.

473
00:19:53,425 --> 00:19:54,927
I just called to tell you

474
00:19:55,427 --> 00:19:58,430
not to bother to come to the
Tropicana Club tonight.

475
00:19:58,931 --> 00:20:02,434
Ricky Ricardo isn't appearing here
anymore.

476
00:20:02,935 --> 00:20:05,437
Yes, I knew you'd want to know.

477
00:20:05,437 --> 00:20:07,439
Oh, no, no, please.

478
00:20:07,439 --> 00:20:09,942
Cancel Mrs. Ackerman's reservation.

479
00:20:09,942 --> 00:20:13,445
But Mrs. Ackerman has a reservation
for 30 people!

480
00:20:13,445 --> 00:20:14,947
I know.

481
00:20:14,947 --> 00:20:16,949
That a girl, Crumley.

482
00:20:16,949 --> 00:20:19,952
Here we go, up and at 'em.

483
00:20:19,952 --> 00:20:22,454
Oh, but ladies, ladies...

484
00:20:22,454 --> 00:20:25,457
You're jolly well stupid, you know.

485
00:20:39,471 --> 00:20:42,474
Now, do not worry, Mr. Littlefield.

486
00:20:42,474 --> 00:20:44,476
After all, they looked rather
strange.

487
00:20:44,476 --> 00:20:45,978
Maybe they did look strange

488
00:20:45,978 --> 00:20:47,479
but they were paying customers.

489
00:20:58,991 --> 00:20:59,491
Hello.

490
00:20:59,992 --> 00:21:00,993
Ah...

491
00:21:01,493 --> 00:21:02,494
Oh...

492
00:21:02,995 --> 00:21:04,496
Oh, it's you.

493
00:21:04,496 --> 00:21:06,999
What's the matter, Alvin?

494
00:21:06,999 --> 00:21:09,001
Well, where is everybody?

495
00:21:09,001 --> 00:21:12,004
They're all out washing their hands.

496
00:21:13,505 --> 00:21:15,507
Isn't this opening night?

497
00:21:15,507 --> 00:21:16,508
Aren't you sold out?

498
00:21:16,508 --> 00:21:17,509
What happened?

499
00:21:17,509 --> 00:21:18,510
Oh, please, please

500
00:21:19,011 --> 00:21:20,512
stop asking so many questions,
Phoebe.

501
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:21,513
Here, sit down.

502
00:21:21,513 --> 00:21:23,015
Pretend you're enjoying yourself.

503
00:21:23,015 --> 00:21:24,016
Hmm?

504
00:21:24,016 --> 00:21:26,018
Well, at least smile.

505
00:21:26,018 --> 00:21:26,518
(chuckles weakly)

506
00:21:27,019 --> 00:21:28,520
Ohh...

507
00:21:57,549 --> 00:22:00,052
Uh... good evening.

508
00:22:00,052 --> 00:22:03,055
Do you have a reservation?

509
00:22:03,055 --> 00:22:05,557
(in nasal accent): Oh, of course we
have a reservation.

510
00:22:05,557 --> 00:22:06,558
Don't we have a reservation?

511
00:22:06,558 --> 00:22:07,559
FRED: Oh, dear!

512
00:22:07,559 --> 00:22:10,062
Hazel, look!

513
00:22:12,564 --> 00:22:13,565
Oh...

514
00:22:14,066 --> 00:22:15,067
Countess Blueblichki

515
00:22:15,067 --> 00:22:18,070
Ricky Ricardo isn't playing here
tonight.

516
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:22,074
(in Russian accent): Ricky Ricardo is
not here anymore?

517
00:22:22,074 --> 00:22:25,077
Well, Mr. Ricardo finished his
engagement here.

518
00:22:25,077 --> 00:22:26,578
Well, where is he playing?

519
00:22:27,079 --> 00:22:28,580
We'll go there.

520
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:30,082
Yes.
Yes.

521
00:22:30,082 --> 00:22:31,583
Well, that does it.

522
00:22:31,583 --> 00:22:33,585
Maurice, get Ricky Ricardo on the
phone.

523
00:22:33,585 --> 00:22:35,587
If I don't get him back, I'll go
bankrupt!

524
00:22:37,089 --> 00:22:39,591
That's a very smart move, my man.

525
00:22:39,591 --> 00:22:40,592
Yes, yes.

526
00:22:40,592 --> 00:22:43,095
When you get Ricky Ricardo back here

527
00:22:43,095 --> 00:22:44,596
we'll be back again.

528
00:22:44,596 --> 00:22:45,597
Good-bye.

529
00:22:45,597 --> 00:22:47,599
Come, girls.

530
00:22:59,945 --> 00:23:02,447
Gee, I wish Ricky would come home

531
00:23:02,447 --> 00:23:03,949
or phone or something.

532
00:23:03,949 --> 00:23:05,951
Didn't his note say he'd phone?

533
00:23:05,951 --> 00:23:07,452
No, it just says...
it says

534
00:23:07,452 --> 00:23:10,455
"Mr. Littlefield called and wanted to
talk to me.

535
00:23:10,956 --> 00:23:12,958
I think he wants to hire me back."

536
00:23:12,958 --> 00:23:13,959
Oh, hiya, folks!

537
00:23:13,959 --> 00:23:14,960
FRED and ETHEL: Hi, Ricky.

538
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:16,461
Hi, honey.

539
00:23:16,461 --> 00:23:17,963
How's everybody?

540
00:23:17,963 --> 00:23:19,464
We got your note.
What happened?

541
00:23:19,965 --> 00:23:21,466
Oh, Lucy, you should have seen what
happened.

542
00:23:21,466 --> 00:23:22,467
No kidding.

543
00:23:22,467 --> 00:23:25,470
Let's see, I went down to the
Tropicana

544
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:29,474
and there wasn't one single solitary
soul in the place.

545
00:23:29,474 --> 00:23:30,475
LUCY: No?

546
00:23:30,475 --> 00:23:32,978
And not only that, but Maurice told
me

547
00:23:33,478 --> 00:23:34,980
that the few people that came in

548
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:37,983
as soon as they found out that I
wasn't there...

549
00:23:38,483 --> 00:23:39,484
out they went.

550
00:23:39,484 --> 00:23:40,485
Fantastic.

551
00:23:40,485 --> 00:23:41,486
My goodness.

552
00:23:41,987 --> 00:23:42,988
Boy!

553
00:23:42,988 --> 00:23:45,991
Well, I guess I didn't realize

554
00:23:45,991 --> 00:23:47,993
how popular I am.

555
00:23:49,995 --> 00:23:51,496
What did Mr. Littlefield say?

556
00:23:51,997 --> 00:23:52,998
Does he want you back?

557
00:23:52,998 --> 00:23:54,499
Does he want me back?

558
00:23:54,499 --> 00:23:56,001
I'll say he does.

559
00:23:56,501 --> 00:23:58,503
He offered me twice as much money

560
00:23:58,503 --> 00:24:00,005
as I was getting before.

561
00:24:00,005 --> 00:24:01,506
Really?

562
00:24:02,007 --> 00:24:02,507
When do you start?

563
00:24:03,008 --> 00:24:04,009
I dun't.

564
00:24:04,509 --> 00:24:06,011
You "dun't"?

565
00:24:06,011 --> 00:24:08,013
What do you mean?

566
00:24:08,013 --> 00:24:10,465
Well, why should I work for him?

567
00:24:10,465 --> 00:24:11,967
If I'm that popular

568
00:24:11,967 --> 00:24:14,319
I can write my own ticket anyplace in
town!

569
00:24:16,721 --> 00:24:18,323
No!

00:01:01,327 --> 00:01:02,929
Of course, you know Ricky

4
00:01:02,929 --> 00:01:05,331
as a famous orchestra leader and
singer

5
00:01:05,331 --> 00:01:07,333
and Lucy as the famous, uh...

6
00:01:07,333 --> 00:01:10,136
Well, she's...
her hair is very red,

7
00:01:10,136 --> 00:01:12,939
and she's married to Ricky.

8
00:01:12,939 --> 00:01:14,941
In this district, close to theaters

9
00:01:14,941 --> 00:01:16,943
and nightclubs where Ricky works,

10
00:01:16,943 --> 00:01:18,545
they have a little apartment

11
00:01:18,545 --> 00:01:22,549
where they laugh, love, and
thoroughly enjoy life.

12
00:01:22,549 --> 00:01:28,588
They live in this apartment here on
the seventh floor.

13
00:01:28,588 --> 00:01:30,190
Now, let's look in.

14
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:33,259
No, no, no, not that apartment.

15
00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:34,994
Yes, that's right.

16
00:01:37,147 --> 00:01:40,283
Okay.

17
00:01:40,283 --> 00:01:41,935
It's 11:00 now.

18
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:43,670
They should be getting up.

19
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:46,172
Ricky is one of those individuals

20
00:01:46,172 --> 00:01:49,976
who wakes up in the morning bright
and cheery.

21
00:01:49,976 --> 00:01:52,378
(alarm clock rings)

22
00:02:15,201 --> 00:02:16,402
On the other hand,

23
00:02:16,402 --> 00:02:18,404
Lucy is one of those individuals

24
00:02:18,404 --> 00:02:21,674
who, when she wakes up in the
morning...

25
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:52,772
(shrieks)

26
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:05,185
He looks like he got in later than I
did.

27
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:08,555
(gasps)

28
00:03:11,558 --> 00:03:14,611
I wonder whatever happened to my
type.

29
00:03:14,611 --> 00:03:18,198
Ricky? Ricky?

30
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:19,199
Ricky?!

31
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:21,150
Yes, Lucy, what is it?

32
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:23,453
If you had known how I look in the
morning,

33
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:25,455
would you still have married me?

34
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:30,543
Well, would you?

35
00:03:30,543 --> 00:03:32,745
I'm trying to decide.

36
00:03:38,384 --> 00:03:41,187
I was just teasing you, honey.

37
00:03:41,187 --> 00:03:43,256
You look beautiful to me all the
time.

38
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:48,828
You were not "tizzing" me.

39
00:03:48,828 --> 00:03:50,430
I know you, Ricky Ricardo.

40
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:53,900
Just because you're going to be a big
television star,

41
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:56,703
you're casting me aside like an old
shoe.

42
00:03:56,703 --> 00:03:59,188
Now, please, don't talk about it
until it happens.

43
00:03:59,188 --> 00:04:00,974
What do you want to do, "jints" me?

44
00:04:00,974 --> 00:04:04,244
"Jints you?"

45
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:07,030
Yeah, jints.

46
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:10,033
J-I-N... um... um...

47
00:04:10,033 --> 00:04:11,384
"X?"

48
00:04:11,384 --> 00:04:14,087
"X?" Don't be ridiculous.

49
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:15,288
I don't have to spell it.

50
00:04:15,288 --> 00:04:16,489
It means "bad luck."

51
00:04:16,489 --> 00:04:19,175
Some sponsors are coming to the club
to see my show,

52
00:04:19,175 --> 00:04:22,428
and if they like it, they'll put it
on television.
That's all.

53
00:04:22,428 --> 00:04:24,847
What night are they coming?
Do you know?

54
00:04:24,847 --> 00:04:25,665
No.

55
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:27,100
You do, too.

56
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,501
I do not.

57
00:04:28,501 --> 00:04:29,736
They're going to tell my agent,

58
00:04:29,736 --> 00:04:31,888
and Jerry will tell me as soon as he
knows.

59
00:04:31,888 --> 00:04:34,057
Well, it doesn't matter.

60
00:04:34,057 --> 00:04:37,527
You'll never be a success on
television anyway.

61
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:38,978
What?

62
00:04:38,978 --> 00:04:39,812
What do you mean

63
00:04:40,213 --> 00:04:41,531
I won't be a success on television?

64
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:43,383
You don't have a pretty girl in your
act.

65
00:04:43,383 --> 00:04:45,852
Ay-yi-yi-yi-yi, here we go again.

66
00:04:45,852 --> 00:04:48,254
On television, you have to have a
pretty girl

67
00:04:48,254 --> 00:04:49,872
to demonstrate the sponsor's product.

68
00:04:49,872 --> 00:04:51,524
Yeah?

69
00:04:51,524 --> 00:04:53,626
Sure-- she eats it or drinks it or
smokes it

70
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:56,913
or waxes the floor with it or cuts
potatoes with it

71
00:04:56,913 --> 00:05:00,633
or drives off in it.

72
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:04,270
Sure. How would you like to have your
sponsor's product

73
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:07,073
demonstrated by a gorgeous redhead?

74
00:05:07,073 --> 00:05:08,274
I'd love it.

75
00:05:08,675 --> 00:05:11,077
You know where I can find one?

76
00:05:11,077 --> 00:05:12,679
Ah...
Ay!

77
00:05:12,679 --> 00:05:14,280
Oh, Ricky, stop.

78
00:05:14,681 --> 00:05:16,683
You're getting lather all over.

79
00:05:16,683 --> 00:05:17,483
Never mind that.

80
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:19,886
Help me find my ear.

81
00:05:19,886 --> 00:05:22,288
You didn't really lose an ear.

82
00:05:22,288 --> 00:05:23,489
Huh?

83
00:05:23,489 --> 00:05:25,491
(giggles softly): Stop.

84
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:27,093
Okay, you talked me into it.

85
00:05:27,093 --> 00:05:30,263
You can demonstrate the sponsor's
product on the show.

86
00:05:30,263 --> 00:05:31,464
Good. What is it?

87
00:05:31,464 --> 00:05:32,749
Men's shorts.

88
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:35,034
Oh...

89
00:05:35,034 --> 00:05:37,470
Now, look, Lucy, you know how I feel
about this.

90
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:39,505
I don't want my wife in show
business.

91
00:05:39,505 --> 00:05:40,306
Why?

92
00:05:40,306 --> 00:05:41,591
Why?

93
00:05:41,591 --> 00:05:42,875
I asked you first.

94
00:05:42,875 --> 00:05:45,878
Oh, honey, we've been over this
10,000 times.

95
00:05:45,878 --> 00:05:49,282
I want a wife who is just a wife.

96
00:05:49,282 --> 00:05:53,252
Now, look, all you got to do is clean
the house for me,

97
00:05:53,252 --> 00:05:55,805
hand me my pipe when I come home at
night,

98
00:05:55,805 --> 00:05:58,608
cook for me, and be the mama for my
children.

99
00:05:58,608 --> 00:05:59,859
You don't smoke a pipe.

100
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:00,860
It doesn't matter.

101
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:01,861
Just do the others.

102
00:06:04,797 --> 00:06:07,200
You're missing a good bet.

103
00:06:12,105 --> 00:06:15,375
I say you're missing a good bet.

104
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:17,377
Am I?

105
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:18,578
Yeah.

106
00:06:21,714 --> 00:06:23,316
How do you figure?

107
00:06:23,716 --> 00:06:25,651
Because I can sing.

108
00:06:25,651 --> 00:06:27,420
Huh?

109
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:29,222
And dance.

110
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:30,473
What else?

111
00:06:30,473 --> 00:06:32,225
And tell jokes.

112
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:33,726
How about it?

113
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:35,461
No.

114
00:06:35,461 --> 00:06:37,463
Oh, you have no imagination.

115
00:06:37,463 --> 00:06:41,067
I'll bet if Ziegfeld or Earl Carroll
had seen me,

116
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:43,269
they'd sign me up like that.

117
00:06:43,269 --> 00:06:44,771
As what?

118
00:06:44,771 --> 00:06:46,272
As a beautiful showgirl.

119
00:06:46,272 --> 00:06:47,757
(doorbell ringing)

120
00:06:47,757 --> 00:06:50,009
Go answer the door.

121
00:07:07,126 --> 00:07:08,127
Hello, Jerry.

122
00:07:08,127 --> 00:07:09,128
Hiya, baby.

123
00:07:09,128 --> 00:07:10,129
Well, this is it, boy.

124
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:11,497
Tonight is the night!

125
00:07:11,497 --> 00:07:13,099
This is it!
Tonight is the night!

126
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:14,350
S-S-Shh!

127
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:15,351
What do you mean, "Shoosh"?

128
00:07:15,768 --> 00:07:18,054
Shout it from the housetops, boy.
This is it!

129
00:07:18,054 --> 00:07:21,073
(muffled yelling)

130
00:07:21,073 --> 00:07:24,210
Tonight is the night the sponsors are
coming down

131
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:25,812
to catch your show for TV.

132
00:07:25,812 --> 00:07:27,613
Fine, fine, but I don't want Lucy to
hear.

133
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:29,115
If she knows the audition is tonight,

134
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:30,616
she'll pester the life out of me.

135
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:31,617
Oh, I see.

136
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:33,119
Well, have you got everything all
set?

137
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:33,619
Sure, everything's fine.

138
00:07:33,619 --> 00:07:34,620
Can you get that clown act

139
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:35,621
you want to put in the show?

140
00:07:35,621 --> 00:07:36,622
You mean Pepito?

141
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:38,624
Yeah, Pepito, the fella that rides on
the bicycle.

142
00:07:38,624 --> 00:07:39,859
Yeah, I'll have him do the bicycle
act,

143
00:07:39,859 --> 00:07:40,726
and then he can do that cello bit.

144
00:07:40,726 --> 00:07:41,544
That's good. Fine.

145
00:07:41,544 --> 00:07:42,545
Then everything is all taken care of,
huh?

146
00:07:43,045 --> 00:07:43,546
Everything's fine.

147
00:07:44,046 --> 00:07:45,047
Okay, I'll see you down at the club
later.

148
00:07:45,047 --> 00:07:45,998
All right, Jerry.

149
00:07:45,998 --> 00:07:47,333
Good. Yeah.
Bye-bye.

150
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:49,602
Oh, ooh! I almost forgot.

151
00:07:49,602 --> 00:07:51,637
The lawyer gave me this yesterday.

152
00:07:51,637 --> 00:07:54,423
He wants you and Lucy to...
hey, what am I whispering for?

153
00:07:54,423 --> 00:07:56,225
He wants you and Lucy to sign it,

154
00:07:56,225 --> 00:07:57,727
and I'll take it right back to him.

155
00:07:57,727 --> 00:07:58,678
What is it?

156
00:07:58,678 --> 00:08:01,013
Well, you know, I don't think he has
much confidence

157
00:08:01,013 --> 00:08:02,732
that you'll be a success in
television.

158
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:05,117
It's your will.

159
00:08:05,117 --> 00:08:07,653
He's been talking about that for
months.

160
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:10,156
Well, come on, boy.
Let's get going with it.

161
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:11,624
Get it signed because on account of
you

162
00:08:11,624 --> 00:08:13,359
I got to take it all the way back
downtown.

163
00:08:13,359 --> 00:08:14,360
Hey, wait a minute, Jerry.

164
00:08:14,861 --> 00:08:15,661
You run along.

165
00:08:15,661 --> 00:08:17,497
I'll have Lucy take it down to the
attorneys.

166
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:18,898
Lucy? Well, now, why should she

167
00:08:18,898 --> 00:08:20,199
have to go all the way down there?

168
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:21,501
It'll take her most of the day,

169
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:23,503
and I won't have her in my hair
during rehearsals.

170
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:24,787
Oh, I see.

171
00:08:24,787 --> 00:08:26,289
Is she still trying to get in the
act?

172
00:08:26,289 --> 00:08:27,290
Ay-yi-yi-yi-yi.

173
00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:28,541
Ah, well, I give up.

174
00:08:28,941 --> 00:08:30,376
I tell you, I'll see you later, huh?

175
00:08:30,376 --> 00:08:31,377
All right, Jerry.

176
00:08:31,377 --> 00:08:33,379
Hey, now, don't forget: knock 'em
dead tonight.

177
00:08:33,379 --> 00:08:34,981
(no audio)

178
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:44,991
Lucy, I got something...

179
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:04,510
Lucy?

180
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:06,579
No.

181
00:09:08,297 --> 00:09:09,298
And that's final.

182
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:21,928
(whistling tunelessly)

183
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:26,999
Hurry up, honey.

184
00:09:26,999 --> 00:09:30,303
Coming, master.

185
00:09:30,303 --> 00:09:31,504
Who was that at the door?

186
00:09:31,504 --> 00:09:32,705
Jerry.

187
00:09:32,705 --> 00:09:34,006
Jerry? What did he say?

188
00:09:34,006 --> 00:09:35,274
Does he know anything yet?

189
00:09:35,274 --> 00:09:37,276
What did he say?
What did he say?

190
00:09:37,276 --> 00:09:40,079
"What did he say?
What did he say?
What did he say?"

191
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:41,280
Nothing. Just business.

192
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,915
He brought my will.

193
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:45,618
Oh. I'll get your toast for you.

194
00:09:45,618 --> 00:09:46,619
Your will?

195
00:09:46,619 --> 00:09:47,853
Yeah.

196
00:09:47,853 --> 00:09:49,505
What's the matter, Ricky?

197
00:09:49,505 --> 00:09:51,223
Nothing is the matter.

198
00:09:51,223 --> 00:09:52,875
There is, too.

199
00:09:52,875 --> 00:09:54,293
You're keeping something from me.

200
00:09:54,293 --> 00:09:55,494
(gasping): You're sick.

201
00:09:55,895 --> 00:09:58,397
I never felt better in my whole life.

202
00:09:58,397 --> 00:10:00,900
Then you lied to me when we were
married.

203
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:03,135
You're really older than I think.

204
00:10:05,204 --> 00:10:08,608
Now, look, honey, this is just good
business.

205
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:10,710
The lawyer said I should have a will.

206
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:12,812
Then everything is legally taken care
of

207
00:10:12,812 --> 00:10:14,814
if anything happens, that's all.

208
00:10:14,814 --> 00:10:16,515
I won't discuss it.

209
00:10:16,515 --> 00:10:19,051
Look, you have to know what to do,

210
00:10:19,051 --> 00:10:21,854
so that you know what you... going to
happen

211
00:10:21,854 --> 00:10:23,623
when, when I go.

212
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:27,026
All right, Ricky.

213
00:10:27,026 --> 00:10:28,995
That's better.

214
00:10:28,995 --> 00:10:31,297
(wailing)

215
00:10:32,798 --> 00:10:35,051
Now what's the matter?

216
00:10:35,051 --> 00:10:38,237
Oh, Ricky, I miss you so!

217
00:10:38,237 --> 00:10:39,939
For goodness' sakes, Lucy,

218
00:10:39,939 --> 00:10:41,707
I haven't gone yet.

219
00:10:41,707 --> 00:10:44,977
Don't go, Ricky.
Don't go!

220
00:10:44,977 --> 00:10:47,480
Now, look, honey, I'm perfectly well.

221
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,248
I feel fine.

222
00:10:49,248 --> 00:10:51,901
But let's face it: we all have to go
sometime.

223
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:53,402
We do?

224
00:10:53,402 --> 00:10:54,904
We do unless you know something

225
00:10:55,404 --> 00:10:56,405
the rest of us don't.

226
00:10:58,591 --> 00:11:00,576
No, I "dun't."

227
00:11:02,728 --> 00:11:03,946
I'll get your toast for you.

228
00:11:03,946 --> 00:11:05,998
All right.

229
00:11:05,998 --> 00:11:07,700
He brought your will along, too.

230
00:11:09,452 --> 00:11:10,453
My will?

231
00:11:10,453 --> 00:11:12,938
Yeah.

232
00:11:12,938 --> 00:11:14,273
What for?

233
00:11:14,273 --> 00:11:16,425
You're the one that's going.

234
00:11:16,425 --> 00:11:17,927
Now, Lucy...

235
00:11:18,427 --> 00:11:19,679
What are you trying to do,

236
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,347
shove me ahead of you in line?

237
00:11:23,132 --> 00:11:25,351
Look, honey, this isn't my idea.

238
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:26,352
It's the lawyers'.

239
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:28,020
We got to get them signed,

240
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:30,389
and you got to take it down to the
attorneys today.

241
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:32,892
Impossible. I have an appointment

242
00:11:32,892 --> 00:11:36,195
to have my hair dyed. Washed.

243
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:38,698
They got to go today.

244
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:40,533
Aw, Ricky, the attorney's way
downtown.

245
00:11:40,933 --> 00:11:41,784
It'll take me all day.

246
00:11:41,784 --> 00:11:44,537
Yeah, I know.

247
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:46,822
Look, Lucy, forget about the toast.

248
00:11:46,822 --> 00:11:48,240
I got to go to the club.

249
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,643
Oh, Ricky, do I have to take them
down today?

250
00:11:50,643 --> 00:11:51,577
Can't they wait?

251
00:11:51,577 --> 00:11:53,079
Absolutely not.

252
00:11:53,079 --> 00:11:54,413
Why not?

253
00:11:54,413 --> 00:11:57,249
Well... well, suppose you didn't take
them down till tomorrow.

254
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:58,684
Yes?

255
00:11:58,684 --> 00:12:00,553
And we both got killed today.

256
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:01,554
Yes?

257
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:04,323
How could you take them down
tomorrow?

258
00:12:04,323 --> 00:12:06,992
Oh, yeah, that's right.

259
00:12:11,664 --> 00:12:14,683
(playing upbeat Cuban music)

260
00:12:18,988 --> 00:12:20,489
Babalu aye

261
00:12:20,489 --> 00:12:21,807
Babalu aye...

262
00:12:21,807 --> 00:12:23,275
Babalu aye

263
00:12:23,275 --> 00:12:26,362
Babalu aye...

264
00:12:26,362 --> 00:12:27,363
Yeah!

265
00:12:57,042 --> 00:13:00,246
(applause)

266
00:13:06,085 --> 00:13:08,737
Fellows, what's the use of having a
rehearsal

267
00:13:08,737 --> 00:13:10,739
if we're not going to do it right?

268
00:13:10,739 --> 00:13:12,741
When you sing, don't go, "Ah, ah, ah,
ah."

269
00:13:12,741 --> 00:13:14,960
Go "Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah!"

270
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:17,246
Let's put some pep into the thing,
you know?

271
00:13:17,246 --> 00:13:18,247
All right?

272
00:13:18,247 --> 00:13:20,499
Okay, all right.

273
00:13:20,499 --> 00:13:22,418
Pepito!

274
00:13:22,418 --> 00:13:23,919
Haven't you got your costume on yet?

275
00:13:23,919 --> 00:13:25,421
I'm coming!

276
00:13:25,421 --> 00:13:27,423
All right.
Start my music!

277
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:28,374
Come on, let's go!
All right.

278
00:13:28,374 --> 00:13:29,975
Let's get "Valencia."

279
00:13:31,577 --> 00:13:34,980
(applause)

280
00:13:39,852 --> 00:13:41,353
(coughs)

281
00:13:41,353 --> 00:13:42,988
(whistles)

282
00:13:42,988 --> 00:13:45,157
(laughs)

283
00:13:50,529 --> 00:13:53,199
Siempre elegante.

284
00:13:57,937 --> 00:13:59,588
(spitting noise)

285
00:14:01,574 --> 00:14:02,791
Aydame un poquito.

286
00:14:02,791 --> 00:14:05,544
Como no, mucho gusto.

287
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:22,561
Ah, thanks, Señor Ricardo, muchas
gracias.

288
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:34,807
My impression of a baby cry.

289
00:14:41,163 --> 00:14:42,665
(squeals)

290
00:14:42,665 --> 00:14:44,166
(screeches)

291
00:14:48,671 --> 00:14:52,174
(cries)

292
00:14:56,679 --> 00:15:00,683
(cries)

293
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:08,607
(applause)

294
00:15:10,609 --> 00:15:17,616
(cries)

295
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:32,031
(applause)

296
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:48,213
ORCHESTRA: Awwww!

297
00:15:49,815 --> 00:15:53,585
The world's smallest bicycle.

298
00:15:56,822 --> 00:16:00,125
Make myself comfortable, Balley,
Señor Balley.

299
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:03,495
(laughter)

300
00:16:16,925 --> 00:16:18,610
(trombone sting)

301
00:16:20,679 --> 00:16:22,681
No, trombonista.

302
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:27,269
(drum sting)

303
00:16:31,573 --> 00:16:39,031
(music and applause)

304
00:16:42,901 --> 00:16:45,838
(applause)

305
00:16:46,238 --> 00:16:47,473
Hey, Don Carmen,

306
00:16:47,473 --> 00:16:50,793
Don Pepe, that's wonderful.

307
00:16:50,793 --> 00:16:51,794
Te gusta, eh?
Very good.

308
00:16:51,794 --> 00:16:52,795
Listen, aren't you going to do

309
00:16:52,795 --> 00:16:54,797
the big bicycle, you know, the zigzag
business?

310
00:16:54,797 --> 00:16:55,798
Oh, the zigzag?
Yeah.

311
00:16:55,798 --> 00:16:56,715
All right?

312
00:16:56,715 --> 00:16:57,916
Okay, vamos a ver.
Okay.

313
00:16:57,916 --> 00:17:02,137
(music playing)

314
00:17:08,994 --> 00:17:11,096
Pepito!
Pepito!

315
00:17:11,096 --> 00:17:13,065
(all shouting)

316
00:17:13,065 --> 00:17:14,566
Pepito!

317
00:17:14,566 --> 00:17:15,567
Are you all right?

318
00:17:15,567 --> 00:17:18,003
Well, I'm alive.

319
00:17:18,003 --> 00:17:19,204
All you need is a little rest.

320
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:20,406
Help him along there.

321
00:17:20,406 --> 00:17:21,206
I go home.

322
00:17:21,607 --> 00:17:24,009
No, Pepito, don't go home, would you?
That's too far.

323
00:17:24,009 --> 00:17:25,210
Why don't you go over to my
apartment?

324
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:26,412
There's nobody there.

325
00:17:26,412 --> 00:17:27,413
You can rest for a couple of hours.

326
00:17:27,846 --> 00:17:28,647
Okay.
All right?

327
00:17:28,647 --> 00:17:29,848
My bicycle broke!

328
00:17:30,249 --> 00:17:31,550
They'll help you with it.
Will you help him?

329
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:33,052
Sure.

330
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:34,386
Take it easy now, Pepe, will you?

331
00:17:34,386 --> 00:17:35,337
I, I, I'll be all right.

332
00:17:35,337 --> 00:17:36,188
All right.

333
00:17:36,188 --> 00:17:37,790
You go and finish your rehearsal.

334
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:40,592
All right, Pepe, take it easy now.

335
00:17:40,592 --> 00:17:42,895
Go with him, would you, fellows?

336
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:46,698
Let's, uh, let's take "The
Continental."

337
00:17:46,698 --> 00:17:48,300
"The Continental," you ready?

338
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:49,101
Okay.

339
00:17:49,101 --> 00:17:50,702
(trumpets start)

340
00:17:50,702 --> 00:17:52,471
All right, all right.

341
00:17:52,471 --> 00:17:53,689
What kind of a start is that?

342
00:17:53,689 --> 00:17:54,990
(orchestra grumbles)

343
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:56,341
All right, all right.

344
00:17:56,341 --> 00:17:58,343
Drum roll.

345
00:17:58,343 --> 00:18:01,080
(trumpets)

346
00:18:07,870 --> 00:18:12,091
(upbeat Cuban music playing)

347
00:18:34,563 --> 00:18:38,250
(screaming)

348
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:40,853
It's me.
It's me, Pepito!

349
00:18:40,853 --> 00:18:42,237
Pepito!

350
00:18:42,237 --> 00:18:43,739
What are you doing here?

351
00:18:43,739 --> 00:18:46,742
I hurt myself at rehearsal.

352
00:18:46,742 --> 00:18:49,328
Ricky told me to come here and rest.

353
00:18:49,328 --> 00:18:51,330
What are you doing at rehearsal?

354
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:53,732
Are they getting ready for that
television audition?

355
00:18:53,732 --> 00:18:55,083
It's tonight.

356
00:18:55,083 --> 00:18:55,968
Tonight!

357
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:58,387
Why, that big bum.

358
00:18:58,387 --> 00:19:01,206
So that's why he wanted me to traipse
all the way downtown.

359
00:19:01,206 --> 00:19:03,075
Just to get rid of me.

360
00:19:05,093 --> 00:19:06,595
Well, how do you feel, Pepito, all
right?

361
00:19:06,595 --> 00:19:09,515
Uh, not so good.

362
00:19:09,515 --> 00:19:11,517
Gee, what's Ricky going to do if
you're not there?

363
00:19:11,517 --> 00:19:12,317
Who will he get?

364
00:19:12,718 --> 00:19:14,419
I don't know.

365
00:19:14,419 --> 00:19:16,321
Maybe you can take my place.

366
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:17,623
Oh, don't be ridicu...

367
00:19:22,528 --> 00:19:25,247
Hey...

368
00:19:25,247 --> 00:19:26,665
Pepito!
Yeah?

369
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:28,267
You look awful.
I do?

370
00:19:28,267 --> 00:19:30,736
Yeah, you're, you're hurt worse than
you think.

371
00:19:30,736 --> 00:19:32,738
I am?!
Yeah, you'd better lie down and rest.

372
00:19:32,738 --> 00:19:34,740
No, no, no, I, I, I,

373
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:36,742
I need, I need to do it for Ricky.

374
00:19:51,723 --> 00:19:52,524
Feels pretty good.

375
00:19:52,524 --> 00:19:55,727
It does, huh?

376
00:19:55,727 --> 00:19:56,929
I think I can do it.

377
00:19:56,929 --> 00:19:58,130
You do, huh?

378
00:19:58,130 --> 00:20:00,933
Yup, yeah, I think I can do it just
fine.

379
00:20:00,933 --> 00:20:03,335
(phone rings)

380
00:20:04,136 --> 00:20:05,337
Hup! Eh!

381
00:20:05,337 --> 00:20:06,939
(yells)

382
00:20:06,939 --> 00:20:09,958
(crashing)

383
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:28,093
Still think you can make it tonight,
Pepito?

384
00:20:28,594 --> 00:20:30,846
(groans)

385
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:48,080
(singing in Spanish)

386
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:06,181
(applause)

387
00:21:06,181 --> 00:21:09,401
Here, did, did, did, did Pepito show
up yet?

388
00:21:09,401 --> 00:21:10,852
No, he has not come.

389
00:21:10,852 --> 00:21:12,337
Oh, my goodness, here we are,

390
00:21:12,337 --> 00:21:13,138
we're giving the audition,

391
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:15,540
the sponsor's out there, and, and
he's not here yet.

392
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:16,892
What am I going to do?

393
00:21:16,892 --> 00:21:17,893
I'll tell you what I'll do.

394
00:21:17,893 --> 00:21:18,894
I'll do one more number,

395
00:21:19,394 --> 00:21:20,395
and if he doesn't show up by then,

396
00:21:20,395 --> 00:21:21,897
I, I'll just have to close the show.

397
00:21:21,897 --> 00:21:22,898
All right?
All right.

398
00:21:22,898 --> 00:21:24,049
Okay.

399
00:21:24,049 --> 00:21:24,950
Eh, we'll do "Cabbie," eh?

400
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:25,951
Give me the hat.

401
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:27,452
Ladies and gentlemen,

402
00:21:27,452 --> 00:21:29,488
may I have your attention for a
minute, please?

403
00:21:29,488 --> 00:21:32,291
You know, the last time that we went
to Havana,

404
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:33,542
we met a fellow down there

405
00:21:33,542 --> 00:21:35,043
that we'd like to talk to you about

406
00:21:35,043 --> 00:21:36,995
because he's really quite a
character.

407
00:21:36,995 --> 00:21:41,216
He, uh, he drives a horse and buggy
in Havana.

408
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:43,001
As a matter of fact,

409
00:21:43,001 --> 00:21:46,305
he drives the only horse and buggy
left in Havana.

410
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:48,807
He, uh, he doesn't believe in taxi
cabs.

411
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:52,811
He says a taxi cab and a Havana moon
don't go well together.

412
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:56,598
So he's broke all the time, but he's
happy.

413
00:21:56,598 --> 00:21:58,900
Everybody knows him down there.

414
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:00,402
They all like him,

415
00:22:00,402 --> 00:22:03,105
and they call him "The Cuban Cabbie."

416
00:22:03,105 --> 00:22:04,523
And if you want to see him,

417
00:22:04,923 --> 00:22:08,527
all you got to do is just come down
with me to Havana.

418
00:22:08,527 --> 00:22:12,798
We sit in the open air cafes in El
Prado.

419
00:22:12,798 --> 00:22:16,001
And he'll be riding up and down the
boulevard.

420
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:17,753
Every night.

421
00:22:17,753 --> 00:22:20,956
And if you happen to be in the mood
for listening,

422
00:22:20,956 --> 00:22:23,925
you probably hear him singing
something like this.

423
00:22:23,925 --> 00:22:26,345
(clip-clop music)

424
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:27,946
Giddyap there, Pinto.

425
00:22:27,946 --> 00:22:29,147
I forgot to tell you.

426
00:22:29,147 --> 00:22:31,550
"Pinto" is the name of the horse.
(laughter)

427
00:22:33,151 --> 00:22:39,658
My horse and carriage is for hire,
Señora

428
00:22:39,658 --> 00:22:42,461
For just as long as you desire

429
00:22:42,461 --> 00:22:45,364
Señorita

430
00:22:45,364 --> 00:22:49,451
Do you want to ride

431
00:22:49,451 --> 00:22:54,790
Forget the mañana and come to Havana
with me

432
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:57,609
I'm the Cuban Cabbie

433
00:22:57,609 --> 00:23:00,879
I'm the Cuban Cabbie

434
00:23:00,879 --> 00:23:05,217
The taxi drivers drive you frantic,
you know

435
00:23:05,217 --> 00:23:08,920
Oh, but my rig is more romantic and
so

436
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:12,958
Do you want to ride?

437
00:23:12,958 --> 00:23:17,763
An eye full of splendor and you can
depend upon me

438
00:23:17,763 --> 00:23:20,565
I'm the Cuban Cabbie

439
00:23:20,966 --> 00:23:22,968
And I need dinero

440
00:23:22,968 --> 00:23:26,138
Money, that is.

441
00:23:26,138 --> 00:23:29,741
The moon is peeping, the shadows
creeping

442
00:23:29,741 --> 00:23:32,944
It's time for riding through the park

443
00:23:32,944 --> 00:23:37,349
A lovely night for lovers

444
00:23:37,349 --> 00:23:40,952
The same as you two are

445
00:23:40,952 --> 00:23:44,956
If you like music, I'll give you
music

446
00:23:44,956 --> 00:23:47,759
As we go riding in the dark

447
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:56,568
I'll sing Spanish love songs to the
strains of my guitar

448
00:23:56,568 --> 00:24:00,555
Esa luna que tienes

449
00:24:00,555 --> 00:24:04,109
Cielito lindo, junto a la boca

450
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:09,114
No se, no besa a nadie, cielito lindo

451
00:24:09,114 --> 00:24:10,899
I'm just kidding fellow.
Si a mi me toca

452
00:24:10,899 --> 00:24:14,352
Aye, aye, ya, aye

453
00:24:14,352 --> 00:24:15,554
Everybody, sing, sing!

454
00:24:15,554 --> 00:24:17,556
Canta y no llores

455
00:24:17,556 --> 00:24:19,157
Canta!

456
00:24:19,157 --> 00:24:25,630
Porque cantando se alegran, cielito
lindo, los corazones

457
00:24:26,064 --> 00:24:27,666
Once more, everybody!

458
00:24:27,666 --> 00:24:29,801
Aye, aye, ya, aye

459
00:24:29,801 --> 00:24:31,403
Aye, yay, yay.

460
00:24:31,403 --> 00:24:35,006
Canta y no llores

461
00:24:35,006 --> 00:24:41,313
Porque cantando se alegran, cielito
lindo, los cora...

462
00:24:42,597 --> 00:24:43,548
ORCHESTRA: Ole!

463
00:24:43,548 --> 00:24:44,883
You're a fine one.

464
00:24:44,883 --> 00:24:46,885
I'm singing a love song.
She's getting hysterical.

465
00:24:46,885 --> 00:24:49,387
(laughter)

466
00:24:49,387 --> 00:24:55,794
My horse and carriage is for hire,
Señora

467
00:24:55,794 --> 00:25:01,132
For just as long as you desire,
Señorita

468
00:25:01,533 --> 00:25:05,537
Do you want to ride

469
00:25:05,537 --> 00:25:10,442
The sweet señoritas and gay
caballeros know me

470
00:25:10,442 --> 00:25:13,762
I'm the Cuban Cabbie

471
00:25:13,762 --> 00:25:16,748
And I know my business

472
00:25:16,748 --> 00:25:19,968
And I mind my business

473
00:25:19,968 --> 00:25:22,120
You want to ride

474
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:23,722
ORCHESTRA: You want to ride

475
00:25:23,722 --> 00:25:24,923
You want to ride

476
00:25:24,923 --> 00:25:26,124
ORCHESTRA: You want to ride

477
00:25:26,124 --> 00:25:30,362
Do you want to ride?

478
00:25:33,465 --> 00:25:37,002
(applause)

479
00:25:39,604 --> 00:25:42,374
(no audio)

480
00:25:42,374 --> 00:25:44,409
Thank you very much, ladies and
gentlemen.

481
00:25:44,809 --> 00:25:45,610
Thank you.

482
00:25:45,610 --> 00:25:48,013
You've been a wonderful audience,

483
00:25:48,013 --> 00:25:50,015
but I am afraid that we're going to
close...

484
00:25:50,015 --> 00:25:52,918
(deep voice): Have you seen a fellow
named Risky Riskerdoe?

485
00:25:52,918 --> 00:25:55,954
Have you seen a fellow named Risky
Riskerdoe?

486
00:25:55,954 --> 00:25:57,689
Have you...? Hah!

487
00:25:59,758 --> 00:26:03,812
(applause)

488
00:26:07,899 --> 00:26:09,901
Who are...?
(screams)

489
00:26:13,939 --> 00:26:15,991
Who are you looking for?

490
00:26:15,991 --> 00:26:18,660
I'm looking for a fellow named Risky
Riskerdoe.

491
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:20,362
I'm Ricky Ricardo.

492
00:26:20,362 --> 00:26:21,863
Oh, well, pleased to meet you.

493
00:26:21,863 --> 00:26:22,714
Pleased to meet you.

494
00:26:22,714 --> 00:26:24,716
You know where I can find Risky
Riskerdoe?

495
00:26:24,716 --> 00:26:27,118
Huh?

496
00:26:27,118 --> 00:26:30,422
Now, look, Pepito-- I mean...
Lucito--

497
00:26:30,422 --> 00:26:33,592
um... we're doing a show here, you
know.

498
00:26:33,592 --> 00:26:35,794
Oh, yeah, I know, I know.

499
00:26:35,794 --> 00:26:37,095
Well, what do you want?

500
00:26:37,095 --> 00:26:38,797
I want to be in the band.

501
00:26:38,797 --> 00:26:40,799
Oh! You're a musician.

502
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:43,218
I am?

503
00:26:43,218 --> 00:26:45,520
Oh, I am!
I am, yeah!

504
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:46,805
Where do I sit?

505
00:26:46,805 --> 00:26:48,440
Hey, wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

506
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:50,041
Come back here.

507
00:26:50,041 --> 00:26:51,343
What do you think you can do,

508
00:26:51,343 --> 00:26:53,478
just walk up here like this

509
00:26:53,478 --> 00:26:55,113
and start working with the band?

510
00:26:55,113 --> 00:26:59,351
(snapping fingers): Just like that?
Just like that?

511
00:26:59,351 --> 00:27:02,420
(chuckling)

512
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:05,056
What do you think this is?

513
00:27:05,056 --> 00:27:07,626
First of all, I'll have to see your
credentials.

514
00:27:07,626 --> 00:27:10,428
(gasping)

515
00:27:18,069 --> 00:27:21,873
Have you had any experience?

516
00:27:24,926 --> 00:27:26,211
Look, Professor...

517
00:27:26,211 --> 00:27:28,246
Professor, come here, will you?

518
00:27:28,246 --> 00:27:29,514
Tell me something.

519
00:27:29,514 --> 00:27:31,282
Do you play that thin?

520
00:27:31,282 --> 00:27:33,268
How's that?

521
00:27:33,268 --> 00:27:35,570
I say, do you play that thin?

522
00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:37,572
What "thin"?

523
00:27:48,083 --> 00:27:50,235
Never mind making fun of my English.

524
00:27:50,235 --> 00:27:52,170
That's English?

525
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:55,457
(audience laughing)

526
00:27:55,457 --> 00:27:57,959
Do you pl...? Do you play that
instrument?

527
00:27:57,959 --> 00:27:59,961
Where?
There.

528
00:27:59,961 --> 00:28:00,962
Where?
Right there.

529
00:28:00,962 --> 00:28:02,213
Where?
There.

530
00:28:02,213 --> 00:28:03,098
You brought it up here.

531
00:28:03,098 --> 00:28:04,099
Right there. There.

532
00:28:04,099 --> 00:28:05,100
Oh!

533
00:28:05,583 --> 00:28:07,385
There!
There.

534
00:28:07,385 --> 00:28:09,888
Do you play it?

535
00:28:09,888 --> 00:28:12,390
Well...

536
00:28:16,561 --> 00:28:18,830
Yeah.
Yeah.

537
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:20,315
Well, I'll tell you what we do.

538
00:28:20,315 --> 00:28:21,766
We'll give you an audition.
Huh?

539
00:28:21,766 --> 00:28:23,034
We'll listen to you.

540
00:28:23,034 --> 00:28:24,536
Play something.
We'll listen.

541
00:28:24,536 --> 00:28:25,437
No!
Yes.

542
00:28:25,437 --> 00:28:26,287
Now? Oh, my!
Right now.

543
00:28:26,287 --> 00:28:27,672
You want to help me?
Okay.

544
00:28:27,672 --> 00:28:28,873
I'll help you with it, sure.

545
00:28:28,873 --> 00:28:30,875
Thanks a lot.
You're welcome.

546
00:28:30,875 --> 00:28:32,877
(audience laughing)

547
00:28:33,294 --> 00:28:35,513
(drumbeat)
Wh...?

548
00:28:40,819 --> 00:28:43,054

(drumming stops)

556
00:29:08,747 --> 00:29:10,448
Oh.

557
00:29:10,448 --> 00:29:11,750
There you are, Professor.

558
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:12,550
Gracias.

559
00:29:12,550 --> 00:29:14,202
Gracias to you, too.

560
00:29:16,004 --> 00:29:18,490

00:29:47,285 --> 00:29:49,788
(applause and laughter)

562
00:29:57,295 --> 00:29:58,596
Yes, Professor?

563
00:29:58,596 --> 00:30:01,082
(no audio)

564
00:30:01,082 --> 00:30:02,884
Oh...
(speaking Spanish)

565
00:30:02,884 --> 00:30:05,236
Huh?

566
00:30:05,236 --> 00:30:08,423
(speaking Spanish)

567
00:30:12,277 --> 00:30:13,678
Gracias.
Gracias.

568
00:30:15,079 --> 00:30:16,681
All right, everybody ready?

569
00:30:17,148 --> 00:30:19,934
We go with the professor on the
downbeat.

570
00:30:19,934 --> 00:30:21,936
Any time you're ready, Professor,

571
00:30:21,936 --> 00:30:23,938
we go with you. Okay.

572
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:28,193
Ready!
Aah-ah!

573
00:30:42,707 --> 00:30:45,910

(drumbeats)

576
00:30:56,521 --> 00:30:57,722
Profess... Professor,

577
00:30:58,122 --> 00:31:00,525
please, come over here, will you,
please?

578
00:31:00,525 --> 00:31:02,126
Look, Professor, I'm sorry,

579
00:31:02,126 --> 00:31:04,312
but I haven't got any use for a
cellist.

580
00:31:04,312 --> 00:31:05,813
No!
No.

581
00:31:06,314 --> 00:31:07,315
I'll tell you what, though.

582
00:31:07,315 --> 00:31:09,317
I have a brand-new instrument.
Yeah?

583
00:31:09,317 --> 00:31:12,270
And I've been looking for somebody
who can play it.
Oh...

584
00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:13,471
And if you can play it...

585
00:31:13,471 --> 00:31:15,073
Yeah.
...you got yourself a job.

586
00:31:15,073 --> 00:31:15,907
Oh...

587
00:31:16,307 --> 00:31:17,208
Yeah.

588
00:31:17,208 --> 00:31:18,209
Oh...

589
00:31:18,209 --> 00:31:19,711
Yeah.

590
00:31:19,711 --> 00:31:20,712
Oh!

591
00:31:21,713 --> 00:31:23,715
You want to try it?

592
00:31:23,715 --> 00:31:25,717
Well, what is it?

593
00:31:25,717 --> 00:31:28,720
It's a saxa-fifa- trona-phono-vich.

594
00:31:29,721 --> 00:31:31,723
Oh, saxa-fifa- trona-phono-vich.

595
00:31:31,723 --> 00:31:32,724
You think you can play it?

596
00:31:33,157 --> 00:31:34,826
Oh, sure, sure.
Well, that's wonderful.

597
00:31:34,826 --> 00:31:35,627
The professor can play it.

598
00:31:36,027 --> 00:31:36,844
Bring it out here.

599
00:31:36,844 --> 00:31:38,897
Professor, we'll take care of the
cello for you.

600
00:31:38,897 --> 00:31:41,699
Here you are. Take good care of the
professor's cello now, all right?

601
00:31:41,699 --> 00:31:44,535
Saxa-fifa-trona-phono-vich Here you
are, Professor.

602
00:31:44,535 --> 00:31:46,638
Saxa-fifa-trona-phono-vich Back here,
Professor.

603
00:31:46,638 --> 00:31:48,022
Saxa-fifa-trona...
Professor.

604
00:31:48,022 --> 00:31:49,474
What?
Professor, back here.

605
00:31:49,474 --> 00:31:51,509
Now, Professor...

606
00:31:51,509 --> 00:31:54,529
all you got to do is just give us a
tune Right.

607
00:31:54,529 --> 00:31:56,030
and you got yourself a job.
Right.

608
00:31:56,030 --> 00:31:57,031
All right?
Right.

609
00:31:57,532 --> 00:31:58,533
Go to it.
Right.

610
00:31:58,533 --> 00:32:01,019
(screams)

611
00:32:04,222 --> 00:32:05,823
That's it right there, Professor.

612
00:32:05,823 --> 00:32:07,025
Right there.
Go ahead.

613
00:32:07,025 --> 00:32:09,093
Any tune.
Any tune.

614
00:32:16,734 --> 00:32:19,137

(applause fades)

621
00:33:14,225 --> 00:33:15,026
Ricky, where you been?

622
00:33:15,026 --> 00:33:17,028
It's almost 3:00.

623
00:33:17,028 --> 00:33:18,896
Ricky, talk to me.

624
00:33:18,896 --> 00:33:22,033
Oh, Ricky.

625
00:33:24,635 --> 00:33:28,239
Gee, I was only trying to help you,
honest.

626
00:33:28,239 --> 00:33:31,576
I never dreamed they'd offer me a
contract.

627
00:33:33,711 --> 00:33:36,981
What are you going to do about it?

628
00:33:39,784 --> 00:33:42,637
What do you want me to do, Ricky?

629
00:33:42,637 --> 00:33:43,521
You know what I want.

630
00:33:43,521 --> 00:33:46,441
All I want you to do is just clean
the house...

631
00:33:46,441 --> 00:33:47,942
Oh, I-I've been cleaning the house

632
00:33:47,942 --> 00:33:50,828
ever since I got home.

633
00:33:53,698 --> 00:33:56,951
...and hand me my pipe...

634
00:33:59,604 --> 00:34:00,822
And cook for you

635
00:34:00,822 --> 00:34:03,074
and be the mama for your children.

636
00:34:03,074 --> 00:34:06,644
Let's see you pull that out of your
pocket.

637
00:34:08,913 --> 00:34:11,816
Well, I kind of wanted to talk to you
about that, Ricky.

638
00:34:11,816 --> 00:34:14,218
I... have a surprise for you.

639
00:34:14,218 --> 00:34:15,136
You do?

640
00:34:15,136 --> 00:34:17,638
Yeah, something that should make you
very happy.

641
00:34:17,638 --> 00:34:19,957
Lucy... you mean?

642
00:34:19,957 --> 00:34:23,094
Yes, darling.

643
00:34:23,094 --> 00:34:26,397
I baked your favorite pie.

644
00:34:28,850 --> 00:34:30,852

00:00:27,594 --> 00:00:29,796
Here, you missed something on this
one.

3
00:00:30,196 --> 00:00:31,531
That's the design.

4
00:00:31,531 --> 00:00:33,033
It is?

5
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:35,035
Sure, can't you see.

gravy.

8
00:00:41,174 --> 00:00:43,960
I've been meaning to talk to you
about Monday night.

9
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:46,413
We want you and Ricky to help us
celebrate.

10
00:00:46,413 --> 00:00:47,764
It's our wedding anniversary.

11
00:00:47,764 --> 00:00:49,049
Oh, yours and Fred's?

12
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:50,650
No, me and Gregory Peck.

13
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:52,802
We've been married for 18 years

14
00:00:52,802 --> 00:00:55,755
and I vowed that at least once before
I died

15
00:00:55,755 --> 00:00:58,108
Fred was going to take me to a
nightclub

16
00:00:58,108 --> 00:01:00,110
on our wedding anniversary.

17
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:01,611
Well, that sounds reasonable.

18
00:01:02,112 --> 00:01:03,113
Now this is my plan.

19
00:01:03,113 --> 00:01:04,114
We'll go in there and I'll say:

20
00:01:04,114 --> 00:01:06,116
"I know what let's do next Monday
night.

21
00:01:06,116 --> 00:01:07,117
Let's go to a nightclub."

22
00:01:07,117 --> 00:01:08,618
And you second the motion.

23
00:01:08,618 --> 00:01:10,120
Then Ricky will bound to his feet and
say

24
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:11,621
"That's great."

25
00:01:11,621 --> 00:01:13,623
Then Fred will have to take me...

26
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:16,976
Ricky bounds to his feet and says,
"That's great"?

27
00:01:16,976 --> 00:01:18,178
Right.

28
00:01:18,178 --> 00:01:19,796
Wrong, Ricky hates nightclubs.

29
00:01:19,796 --> 00:01:21,114
But he works in one.

30
00:01:21,114 --> 00:01:24,717
Your life should be just one gay
round of nightclubs.

31
00:01:24,717 --> 00:01:27,554
Yeah, that's what I thought when I
married a bandleader,

32
00:01:27,554 --> 00:01:28,755
but ever since we said "I do"

33
00:01:28,755 --> 00:01:30,356
there are so many things we don't.

34
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:37,764
Well, it was a good idea while it
lasted.

35
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:41,234
Gee, it was going to be the
Copacabana.

36
00:01:41,734 --> 00:01:43,069
The Copacabana.

37
00:01:43,069 --> 00:01:44,687
Uh-huh.

38
00:01:44,687 --> 00:01:45,572
Gee!

39
00:01:45,572 --> 00:01:48,007
Well, don't you worry, we'll go!

40
00:01:48,007 --> 00:01:49,209
We will?

41
00:01:49,209 --> 00:01:51,611
Sure, I want to go as much as you do.

42
00:01:51,611 --> 00:01:54,214
But don't forget you can catch more
flies

43
00:01:54,214 --> 00:01:56,216
with honey than you can with vinegar.

44
00:01:56,616 --> 00:01:57,817
You mean, be nice to the boys?

45
00:01:57,817 --> 00:01:59,285
Yeah, we'll be so lovey-dovey to them

46
00:01:59,752 --> 00:02:01,037
that they'll be sitting in a
nightclub

47
00:02:01,538 --> 00:02:02,539
before they know what hit them.

48
00:02:02,539 --> 00:02:04,424
Oh, that ought to do it.
Sure.

49
00:02:04,424 --> 00:02:06,960
Hey, Rick, are you doing anything
Monday night?

50
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,262
I don't think so.
It's my night off, why?

51
00:02:09,262 --> 00:02:11,764
I'd like you to join me in
commemoration

52
00:02:12,265 --> 00:02:13,967
of an 18-year-old tragedy.

53
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:18,104
What do you mean?

54
00:02:18,605 --> 00:02:20,440
Well, it's our wedding anniversary.

55
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:23,143
Oh, you want us to join you in a
celebration?

56
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:25,778
I prefer to think of it as a grim
reminder.

57
00:02:25,778 --> 00:02:28,031
I'd like to go over to Charlie's
steak house

58
00:02:28,031 --> 00:02:29,532
and then take in the fights.

59
00:02:31,851 --> 00:02:33,720
Oh, you dreamer, you.

60
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,021
Yeah, I guess you're right.

61
00:02:35,421 --> 00:02:36,322
I don't know, Fred.

62
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:39,025
If you want to go to the fights, I
think you should.

63
00:02:39,459 --> 00:02:41,211
After all, it's your anniversary.

64
00:02:41,211 --> 00:02:42,212
There must be some way

65
00:02:42,212 --> 00:02:44,714
we can get the girls to go to the
fights.

66
00:02:44,714 --> 00:02:47,217
Yeah, we can tie them in sacks

67
00:02:47,217 --> 00:02:48,218
and carry them in.

68
00:02:48,718 --> 00:02:49,719
I tell you what!

69
00:02:49,719 --> 00:02:52,722
As soon as they come into the living
room

70
00:02:52,722 --> 00:02:54,941
we'll be real nice to them, see

71
00:02:54,941 --> 00:02:56,543
soft-soap them a little

72
00:02:56,943 --> 00:02:57,744
smoosh 'em up.

73
00:02:57,744 --> 00:02:58,945
Smoosh?

74
00:02:58,945 --> 00:03:00,246
Ethel?

75
00:03:02,382 --> 00:03:04,784
Now, look, everybody knows you can
get around a woman

76
00:03:04,784 --> 00:03:06,119
with a little sweet talk.

77
00:03:06,119 --> 00:03:08,121
Well, that's all right for Lucy

78
00:03:08,121 --> 00:03:10,623
but it's a longer trip around Ethel.

79
00:03:10,623 --> 00:03:12,525
Do you want to go to the fights, or
don't you?

80
00:03:12,525 --> 00:03:14,527
All right, all right, I'll smooch.

81
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:16,029
Okay, now...

82
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:17,830
How can four people use so many
dishes?

83
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:19,832
I don't know.

84
00:03:21,901 --> 00:03:22,702
What's the matter?

85
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:23,703
What you standing up for?

86
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:26,706
Because two gorgeous ladies entered
the room.

87
00:03:26,706 --> 00:03:28,208
They did, where?

88
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:32,011
They mean us.

89
00:03:33,012 --> 00:03:34,931
Oh!

90
00:03:34,931 --> 00:03:38,451
You great big Latin lover, you!

91
00:03:38,451 --> 00:03:42,939
Oh, you sweet handsome man, you!

92
00:03:42,939 --> 00:03:46,426
You gorgeous exciting woman, you!

93
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:49,062
I pass.

94
00:03:53,816 --> 00:03:54,817
Aw, isn't he cute?

95
00:03:54,817 --> 00:03:57,820
Darling, why don't you sit down here.

96
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:59,822
Oh, yes, you sit down, too, baby.

97
00:03:59,822 --> 00:04:01,040
Well, you sit down on my lap.

98
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,458
You'll be more comfortable there.

99
00:04:02,458 --> 00:04:03,309
All right.

100
00:04:03,309 --> 00:04:04,244
You sit there, darling.

101
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:05,745
This chair is more comfortable.

102
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:07,247
Oh, but if it's so comfortable

103
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:08,748
I want you to have it.

104
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:10,717
Ethel, do one thing that I ask, will
you, please?

105
00:04:10,717 --> 00:04:11,918
I said sit down!

106
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:22,161
Ethel, don't you think you're
overdoing it a little?

107
00:04:33,523 --> 00:04:35,024
How about a cigarette?

108
00:04:35,024 --> 00:04:36,025
BOTH: I'll get them.

109
00:04:36,442 --> 00:04:39,028
No, don't trouble yourself.

110
00:04:40,747 --> 00:04:42,915
Oh!
Oh, sorry.

111
00:04:42,915 --> 00:04:43,866
Thank you very much.

112
00:04:44,367 --> 00:04:45,184
That's all right.

113
00:04:45,184 --> 00:04:46,953
Thank you, Lucy.

114
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:48,454
Thank you very much.

115
00:04:48,454 --> 00:04:49,722
It's all right.

116
00:04:49,722 --> 00:04:52,091
ALL: Light, light?

117
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:07,740
You know, Ricky, baby,

118
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:09,692
there's only one time you look
handsomer than you do now

119
00:05:09,692 --> 00:05:11,377
and that's when you wear a tuxedo.

120
00:05:11,778 --> 00:05:13,062
Oh, yes, I think a tuxedo

121
00:05:13,062 --> 00:05:14,564
is the best- looking thing

122
00:05:15,064 --> 00:05:16,065
a man can wear.

123
00:05:16,065 --> 00:05:18,568
Unless he's wearing boxing trunks.

124
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:19,535
Speaking of boxing

125
00:05:19,535 --> 00:05:21,621
there's nothing more exciting

126
00:05:21,621 --> 00:05:22,905
than a ringside seat.

127
00:05:22,905 --> 00:05:26,542
Yes, sir, a ringside seat at the
Copacabana.

128
00:05:27,043 --> 00:05:29,762
Yeah. Well, look, Lucy, Monday is
Fred's anniversary

129
00:05:29,762 --> 00:05:31,781
and he wants to go to the fights.

130
00:05:31,781 --> 00:05:33,549
Yeah, well, Monday's Ethel's
anniversary, too,

131
00:05:33,549 --> 00:05:35,234
and she wants to go to a nightclub.

132
00:05:35,234 --> 00:05:37,086
Yeah, well, Fred is not going to go

133
00:05:37,587 --> 00:05:38,888
to any stuffy nightclub.

134
00:05:38,888 --> 00:05:41,391
Well, Ethel's not going to any stale
fights.

135
00:05:41,391 --> 00:05:43,393
Lucy, don't push me too far.

136
00:05:43,393 --> 00:05:45,395
It's the fights or nothing.

137
00:05:45,395 --> 00:05:46,679
Well, is that final?

138
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:47,647
Final.

139
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:48,481
Then you brought this on yourself.

140
00:05:48,481 --> 00:05:49,732
Ethel wants a divorce.

141
00:05:49,732 --> 00:05:50,733
Good.

142
00:05:50,733 --> 00:05:54,020
No, she doesn't!

143
00:05:55,521 --> 00:05:57,023
No, I don't!

144
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:59,525
Well, honey, you said you wanted to
go...

145
00:05:59,525 --> 00:06:01,828
Why don't you mind your own business?

146
00:06:01,828 --> 00:06:03,329
(arguing)

147
00:06:03,329 --> 00:06:05,581
Wait a minute, will you!

148
00:06:05,581 --> 00:06:08,084
Everybody be calm!

149
00:06:08,084 --> 00:06:10,870
We'll figure out a way to settle this
thing.

150
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:14,874
I know, the democratic way!

151
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:16,876
We'll put it to a vote.

152
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:20,880
Couldn't you guess how it's going to
come out?

153
00:06:23,249 --> 00:06:26,102
We'll try it anyhow.

154
00:06:26,102 --> 00:06:28,354
All right, everybody wants to go to
the fights

155
00:06:28,354 --> 00:06:29,639
raise their hand.

156
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:31,441
One, two.

157
00:06:31,441 --> 00:06:33,443
Everybody wants to go to the
nightclub

158
00:06:33,443 --> 00:06:34,694
raise their hands.

159
00:06:34,694 --> 00:06:38,064
One, two, three.

160
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:40,283
All right, I guess we'll have to go

161
00:06:40,283 --> 00:06:41,284
to the Copaca...

162
00:06:41,284 --> 00:06:42,285
Three?

163
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:46,239
Lucy!

164
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:48,841
Well, I don't care.
We want to go to the Copacabana.

165
00:06:48,841 --> 00:06:50,543
We're going to the fights.

166
00:06:50,543 --> 00:06:52,044
If you go to the fights, you can just
go alone.

167
00:06:52,044 --> 00:06:53,946
Okay, if that's the way you want it

168
00:06:53,946 --> 00:06:54,747
and I hope you have

169
00:06:54,747 --> 00:06:56,382
a nice, pleasant evening at home.

170
00:06:56,382 --> 00:06:57,850
Who's staying at home?

171
00:06:57,850 --> 00:07:00,319
Ethel and I are going dancing at the
Copa.

172
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:04,023
I hope one of you knows how to lead.

173
00:07:04,023 --> 00:07:06,259
We will not be dancing together,
smarty.

174
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:07,460
We will have dates.

175
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:08,728
We will?

176
00:07:09,979 --> 00:07:11,981
Oh, we will, we will!

177
00:07:13,483 --> 00:07:16,235
Date, Ethel with a date?

178
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,872
Dates!

179
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:21,657
That's very funny!

180
00:07:22,158 --> 00:07:23,509
LUCY: Go ahead and laugh.

181
00:07:23,509 --> 00:07:24,844
I know just who our dates will be,

182
00:07:25,244 --> 00:07:27,647
and they're both tall, dark and
handsome and young.

183
00:07:30,349 --> 00:07:33,920
Who are they?

184
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:36,389
You'll just die when I tell you.

185
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:38,925
Two of the most eligible young
bachelors in town.

186
00:07:39,325 --> 00:07:42,361
Of course I can't talk while certain
parties are in the room.

187
00:07:42,361 --> 00:07:44,213
Well, whisper their names to me.

188
00:07:44,213 --> 00:07:45,715
Okay.

189
00:07:47,066 --> 00:07:48,384
No!

190
00:07:48,384 --> 00:07:49,886
Yes!

191
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:51,237
I guess we can take a hint.

192
00:07:51,237 --> 00:07:53,189
Come on downstairs to my apartment,
Rick.

193
00:07:53,189 --> 00:07:55,191
I don't like the atmosphere up here.

194
00:07:55,191 --> 00:07:56,509
Yeah.

195
00:08:03,249 --> 00:08:06,836
Lucy, what were those names you
whispered to me?

196
00:08:06,836 --> 00:08:08,538
What did they sound like?

197
00:08:08,938 --> 00:08:13,359
It sounded like Little Boy Blue and
Peter Cottontail.

198
00:08:13,359 --> 00:08:14,560
That's who it was.

199
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,162
Huh?

200
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:18,414
Well, I was just trying to put up a
big front

201
00:08:18,414 --> 00:08:19,382
while the boys were here.

202
00:08:19,382 --> 00:08:21,267
That's what I was afraid of.

203
00:08:21,267 --> 00:08:22,869
Where can we get any dates?

204
00:08:22,869 --> 00:08:24,136
Don't give up so easily.

205
00:08:24,637 --> 00:08:26,072
We'll find some men somewhere.

206
00:08:26,472 --> 00:08:27,673
Where?

207
00:08:27,673 --> 00:08:30,676
There's no place where millions of
single women

208
00:08:31,077 --> 00:08:32,478
haven't already looked.

209
00:08:32,478 --> 00:08:35,848
Well, how about...

210
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:36,849
No.

211
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:39,852
Uh...

212
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:41,354
No.

213
00:08:42,555 --> 00:08:44,223
Oh, we're not concentrating.

214
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:47,994
We must know two men who are single
and attractive.

215
00:08:49,729 --> 00:08:52,131
Two men who are single?

216
00:08:57,003 --> 00:08:58,287
Two men?

217
00:09:01,107 --> 00:09:02,708
A boy and a dog?

218
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:07,947
No, maybe we should settle

219
00:09:07,947 --> 00:09:10,750
for Little Boy Blue and Peter
Cottontail.

220
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:12,351
I know.
What?

221
00:09:12,351 --> 00:09:13,603
I'll get my address book,

222
00:09:13,603 --> 00:09:15,104
call up some of my old boyfriends.

223
00:09:15,104 --> 00:09:16,105
Oh, Lucy.

224
00:09:16,105 --> 00:09:17,607
It's only 11 years old.

225
00:09:17,607 --> 00:09:18,858
Oh!

226
00:09:18,858 --> 00:09:20,860
Well, after all, it's worth a try.

227
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:22,862
This is an emergency.

228
00:09:22,862 --> 00:09:24,697
I'll start at the A's.

229
00:09:25,147 --> 00:09:26,866
George Anderson.

230
00:09:26,866 --> 00:09:29,569
Hmm, Butterfield 89970.

231
00:09:39,629 --> 00:09:41,631
Brother, will Monday be a night!

232
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:42,882
We'll go over to Charlie's

233
00:09:43,282 --> 00:09:45,051
and we'll get steaks this thick

234
00:09:45,051 --> 00:09:46,502
and we'll have big slices

235
00:09:46,502 --> 00:09:48,004
of raw onions all over 'em.

236
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:50,006
And there won't be any women around

237
00:09:50,006 --> 00:09:51,824
to tell us we can't eat them.

238
00:09:51,824 --> 00:09:54,961
Do you suppose they really can get
dates?

239
00:09:54,961 --> 00:09:56,262
Well, who cares.

240
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:58,764
Why don't you stop worrying about
them.

241
00:10:00,066 --> 00:10:01,567
I keep thinking

242
00:10:01,567 --> 00:10:04,570
that they'll go out to dinner
somewhere

243
00:10:05,071 --> 00:10:07,073
and they'll have some champagne

244
00:10:07,573 --> 00:10:09,959
then they'll go to the Copacabana

245
00:10:09,959 --> 00:10:12,111
and have more champagne

246
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:15,615
and then they'll dance and have more
champagne

247
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:18,367
and who knows what will happen.

248
00:10:18,367 --> 00:10:22,455
Yeah, with all that champagne even
Ethel might look good.

249
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:24,924
Well, what are we going to do, Rick?

250
00:10:25,424 --> 00:10:27,426
Well, we could get dates, too

251
00:10:27,426 --> 00:10:30,930
and go to the Copacabana and keep an
eye on them.

252
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:33,215
No, that's not a very good idea.

253
00:10:33,215 --> 00:10:34,967
Dates!

254
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:35,968
You said dates.

255
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:38,738
Ricky, that's the most sensational
idea

256
00:10:38,738 --> 00:10:39,722
you ever had!

257
00:10:39,722 --> 00:10:41,223
And we owe it to ourselves.

258
00:10:41,724 --> 00:10:43,225
We can get a couple of blondes

259
00:10:43,693 --> 00:10:45,194
just to help us keep our eye

260
00:10:45,194 --> 00:10:46,696
on our wives who've seen fit

261
00:10:47,196 --> 00:10:48,698
to go out with other men!

262
00:10:48,698 --> 00:10:49,548
Yeah.

263
00:10:49,548 --> 00:10:50,750
And they couldn't get mad at us

264
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:52,018
by being with other girls

265
00:10:52,018 --> 00:10:53,619
because they're there with other
fellows.

266
00:10:53,619 --> 00:10:55,287
What a dream situation.

267
00:10:55,287 --> 00:10:57,289
And I bet you know a million gals.

268
00:10:57,723 --> 00:10:59,358
Where's your address book?

269
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:02,495
I burned it.

270
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:04,130
Burned it!

271
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:06,499
I hadn't been in this country very
long

272
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:08,501
and Lucy said it was part of

273
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:10,503
the American marriage ceremony.

274
00:11:14,206 --> 00:11:16,058
That's absolutely criminal.

275
00:11:16,058 --> 00:11:19,612
I bet you could have got a fortune
for that book.

276
00:11:19,612 --> 00:11:22,181
"A" alone was worth a hundred bucks.

277
00:11:24,016 --> 00:11:26,235
Hey, I'll tell you what I'll do.

278
00:11:26,235 --> 00:11:27,737
I'll call Ginny Jones.

279
00:11:27,737 --> 00:11:28,988
You mean the girl that sings at the
Starlight Roof?

280
00:11:28,988 --> 00:11:30,489
Yeah.

281
00:11:30,489 --> 00:11:33,726
She's married now, but she knows
every girl in town.

282
00:11:34,126 --> 00:11:36,078
I'm glad you thought of her.

283
00:11:43,102 --> 00:11:46,539
Yes, well, it's been nice talking to
you, Paul.

284
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:48,841
Yes, it's been a long time.

285
00:11:48,841 --> 00:11:50,443
My, my, seven children.

286
00:11:50,443 --> 00:11:52,712
Yes, it's been a long time.

287
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:55,464
Yes, well, all right, good-bye, Paul.

288
00:11:56,465 --> 00:11:58,467
Well, that takes care of old Wagner.

289
00:11:58,467 --> 00:12:02,188
Yeah, Excelsior Cleaners, Yum Yum
Market

290
00:12:02,188 --> 00:12:03,789
and Sam Zabaglione.

291
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:06,542
Sam Zabaglione, he must be around.

292
00:12:06,942 --> 00:12:08,627
Nobody would marry him.

293
00:12:09,028 --> 00:12:10,896
Plaza 52099.

294
00:12:11,897 --> 00:12:13,899
Did you call up Howard Thompson?

295
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:15,201
He isn't marked off.

296
00:12:15,601 --> 00:12:17,703
Yeah, he's busy Monday night.

297
00:12:17,703 --> 00:12:19,705
Baby-sitting with his grandson.

298
00:12:19,705 --> 00:12:21,507
Oh, yeah.

299
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:23,309
Grandson!

300
00:12:23,309 --> 00:12:25,778
Well, don't look at me like that!

301
00:12:25,778 --> 00:12:26,579
When I dated him

302
00:12:27,046 --> 00:12:29,415
he was an interesting older man.

303
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:32,651
Hello, hello, is this Sam
Zabaglione's house?

304
00:12:33,052 --> 00:12:37,056
Oh, no, no, no, don't call your daddy
to the phone.

305
00:12:37,056 --> 00:12:38,724
I don't want to talk...

306
00:12:38,724 --> 00:12:40,326
Little girl, paisan!

307
00:12:46,031 --> 00:12:48,033
Well, we can always call the zoo

308
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:50,836
and order a couple of dancing bears.

309
00:12:51,237 --> 00:12:54,356
Oh! Why didn't I think of this
before.

310
00:12:54,356 --> 00:12:55,858
Who are you calling?

311
00:12:56,325 --> 00:12:57,243
Who, who, who?

312
00:12:57,693 --> 00:13:00,246
Quiet, you sound like an owl.

313
00:13:00,246 --> 00:13:01,614
Well, who are you calling?

314
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:03,749
Ginny Jones, she works at the
Starlight Roof

315
00:13:03,749 --> 00:13:05,751
and she knows every man in town.

316
00:13:05,751 --> 00:13:08,254
Oh, I feel hopeful again.

317
00:13:09,755 --> 00:13:12,258
Hello, Ginny, Ginny, this is Lucy
Ricardo.

318
00:13:12,658 --> 00:13:13,959
Well, it's very nice

319
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:16,395
to hear your voice again, too, dear.

320
00:13:16,395 --> 00:13:17,997
I'll tell you why I called.

321
00:13:17,997 --> 00:13:21,200
It seems that a friend of mine, Ethel
Mertz...

322
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,401
What?

323
00:13:22,401 --> 00:13:24,003
They did!

324
00:13:24,003 --> 00:13:26,055
Ricky and Fred just called her.

325
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:27,773
They did!

326
00:13:27,773 --> 00:13:30,176
They didn't.

327
00:13:30,176 --> 00:13:32,578
They didn't!

328
00:13:32,578 --> 00:13:34,346
They did!

329
00:13:34,346 --> 00:13:35,948
They did!

330
00:13:36,348 --> 00:13:38,400
They didn't!

331
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:42,221
Well, did they or didn't they?

332
00:13:42,221 --> 00:13:43,622
Ricky and Fred just asked her

333
00:13:43,622 --> 00:13:45,658
to get them dates for Monday night,
too.

334
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:46,859
They didn't!

335
00:13:46,859 --> 00:13:48,961
They did!

336
00:13:48,961 --> 00:13:50,246
Those dirty two-timers.

337
00:13:50,746 --> 00:13:52,248
Wait till I get my hands on...

338
00:13:52,248 --> 00:13:54,250
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute, I got an idea.

339
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:56,552
Ginny, I want you to get them dates

340
00:13:56,552 --> 00:13:57,436
for Monday night.

341
00:13:57,837 --> 00:13:59,038
That's right.

342
00:13:59,038 --> 00:14:01,106
But the dates will be Ethel and me.

343
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:03,175
Yeah, and one more thing, Ginny

344
00:14:03,175 --> 00:14:06,478
I want you to build up these
beautiful, blind dates

345
00:14:06,478 --> 00:14:08,981
yeah, and tell them that we'll meet
them

346
00:14:08,981 --> 00:14:10,716
at Ricky's apartment at 8:00.

347
00:14:11,116 --> 00:14:12,351
That's right.

348
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:14,220
Just leave the rest to us, Ginny.

349
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:15,821
Okay, bye.

350
00:14:32,588 --> 00:14:34,590
I wonder what they'll be like.

351
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:37,743
Ginny said that they were just
knockouts.

352
00:14:38,143 --> 00:14:38,961
Real dreams.

353
00:14:38,961 --> 00:14:40,212
(whistles)

354
00:14:40,212 --> 00:14:42,181
Gorgeous willowy figures.

355
00:14:42,181 --> 00:14:45,517
(whistles)

356
00:14:45,517 --> 00:14:47,119
Sweet dispositions.

357
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,188
I wonder why they wanted

358
00:14:49,188 --> 00:14:50,956
to meet us here at the apartment.

359
00:14:50,956 --> 00:14:52,958
Well, maybe they want to be with us
alone.

360
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:54,960
Well, why...?
Now, now, don't fight it.

361
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:57,496
Just be thankful our wives have got
early dinner dates.

362
00:14:57,947 --> 00:14:59,448
(doorbell rings)

363
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:16,665
Hello, there!

364
00:15:22,254 --> 00:15:23,923
H-H... How do you, how do you do?

365
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:25,674
We're be looking for a couple

366
00:15:25,674 --> 00:15:27,927
of fellers named Ricky and Fred.

367
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:28,928
Be you they?

368
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:33,532
We be...
We be Simon and Elmer.

369
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:35,134
Good-bye.

370
00:15:35,534 --> 00:15:37,486
Oh, boy, that's a good one.

371
00:15:37,987 --> 00:15:39,305
We be your dates.

372
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:43,275
This one is yours, Fred.

373
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:44,977
FRED: Oh, no, no, no.

374
00:15:56,922 --> 00:15:59,341
This one is yours, too, Fred.

375
00:16:02,344 --> 00:16:03,345
Wait a minute, now

376
00:16:03,846 --> 00:16:05,347
there's a little mistake here, fella.

377
00:16:05,848 --> 00:16:08,100
I'm going to have that little man
right over there

378
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:09,835
and this one is yours, Ma.

379
00:16:09,835 --> 00:16:12,037
(whimpering): Oh, no.

380
00:16:12,037 --> 00:16:14,273
Hey, I'm going to like you.

381
00:16:14,273 --> 00:16:15,774
Now, look, look, girls

382
00:16:15,774 --> 00:16:16,775
there must be some mistake here.

383
00:16:17,209 --> 00:16:18,861
We're waiting for some friends of
Ginny Jones.

384
00:16:18,861 --> 00:16:20,312
Well, that's us'n.

385
00:16:20,312 --> 00:16:22,948
I'm Yuncy, this here's my ma.

386
00:16:25,017 --> 00:16:26,902
That's your mother?

387
00:16:27,403 --> 00:16:28,654
It is?

388
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:30,956
Oh, it is, it is, yeah!

389
00:16:31,423 --> 00:16:32,241
I knew that.

390
00:16:32,691 --> 00:16:34,410
Do something, Ricky!

391
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:37,296
Look, look, girls, it's very nice of
you

392
00:16:37,696 --> 00:16:39,298
to come over

393
00:16:39,298 --> 00:16:41,300
but an emergency just came up

394
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:44,053
and we have to change our plans.

395
00:16:44,053 --> 00:16:46,271
Oh, look at him, Ma, he's shy.

396
00:16:46,271 --> 00:16:48,557
What's the matter, sonny boy?

397
00:16:48,557 --> 00:16:49,541
Come on, kiss me.

398
00:16:49,541 --> 00:16:50,759
Wait a minute.

399
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:52,077
Come on, kiss me.

400
00:16:52,077 --> 00:16:53,278
Kiss me right now.

401
00:16:53,278 --> 00:16:55,280
Let's get acquainted a little bit.

402
00:16:56,949 --> 00:16:58,767
Oh, boy, Ma, this is fun!

403
00:17:08,193 --> 00:17:11,497
What's the matter, boy, ain't I your
type?

404
00:17:13,098 --> 00:17:16,402
Oh, I do like to see the youngins
having fun!

405
00:17:16,402 --> 00:17:17,753
It's past his bedtime.

406
00:17:17,753 --> 00:17:20,205
He's got a rehearsal in the morning.

407
00:17:20,205 --> 00:17:22,708
Killjoy, come on over here and sit
down.

408
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:23,709
RICKY: Now hold it!

409
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:25,010
Wait a minute!

410
00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:26,612
He's right, that's it.

411
00:17:26,612 --> 00:17:29,048
I have to rehearse in the morning.

412
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:30,549
Oh, are you an actor feller?

413
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:32,284
No, no.

414
00:17:32,284 --> 00:17:33,485
A dancer feller?

415
00:17:33,485 --> 00:17:34,803
No, I'm a singer feller.

416
00:17:34,803 --> 00:17:35,804
No!

417
00:17:35,804 --> 00:17:37,806
MA: Well, sing something.

418
00:17:37,806 --> 00:17:38,807
Yeah.

419
00:17:38,807 --> 00:17:40,225
No, I couldn't.
Really, I couldn't.

420
00:17:40,225 --> 00:17:41,110
Okay, let's neck.

421
00:17:41,610 --> 00:17:42,428
Wait a minute.

422
00:17:44,029 --> 00:17:45,764
I'll sing.

423
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:48,200
What, uh...

424
00:17:48,617 --> 00:17:49,968
What would you like to hear?

425
00:17:50,402 --> 00:17:52,404
Oh, any little ditty.

426
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:54,656
How about "Guadalajara"?

427
00:17:54,656 --> 00:17:56,158
Oh, that was beautiful.

428
00:17:56,158 --> 00:17:57,659
Let's neck.

429
00:17:57,659 --> 00:17:59,661
No, wait a minute, wait a minute.

430
00:18:06,051 --> 00:18:10,839
Guadalajara, Guadalajara

431
00:18:10,839 --> 00:18:15,844
Guadalajara, Guadalajara

432
00:18:15,844 --> 00:18:17,846
Tienes el alma de provinciana

433
00:18:17,846 --> 00:18:22,367
Puede ser limpia rosa temprana

434
00:18:22,367 --> 00:18:24,369
A ver dejara breca del rio

435
00:18:24,369 --> 00:18:25,654
Son mis palomas tu caserio

436
00:18:25,654 --> 00:18:30,659
Guadalajara, Guadalajara...

437
00:18:30,659 --> 00:18:38,784
Ay, ay, ay ay, ay, ay

438
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:44,890
Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay

439
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:46,492
Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay!

440
00:18:48,527 --> 00:18:54,933
Ay, colomitos lejano

441
00:18:54,933 --> 00:18:56,935
Ay...!

442
00:18:58,687 --> 00:19:01,690
Ojito, te...

443
00:19:01,690 --> 00:19:04,393
Hay colomitos inolvidables

444
00:19:04,393 --> 00:19:06,895
Inolvidable como la tarde

445
00:19:06,895 --> 00:19:10,349
En que la lluvia deja el aroma

446
00:19:10,349 --> 00:19:12,701
Y nos hacia hasta sapopa.

447
00:19:13,202 --> 00:19:15,587
Sapopa.

448
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:22,961
Ay, ay, ay

449
00:19:22,961 --> 00:19:26,165
Ay, ay, ay

450
00:19:26,565 --> 00:19:29,751
Ay, ay, ay

451
00:19:29,751 --> 00:19:33,305
Ay, ay, ay...

452
00:19:38,143 --> 00:19:42,147
Guadalajara

453
00:19:42,548 --> 00:19:50,522
Gua-da-la-ja-ra!

454
00:19:58,063 --> 00:20:00,732
Well, well, if that don't beat all.

455
00:20:00,732 --> 00:20:03,936
I sure didn't know you had it in you,
boy!

456
00:20:03,936 --> 00:20:05,137
Come on, let's neck.

457
00:20:06,738 --> 00:20:09,675
Let's have a cigarette.

458
00:20:09,675 --> 00:20:11,760
Yeah, let's smoke it up a bit.

459
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:13,478
I had a pack here a minute ago.

460
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:17,082
I know where they are, sonny, I'll
get 'em for you.

461
00:20:17,082 --> 00:20:19,084
YUNCY: Here you are, sonny.

462
00:20:19,484 --> 00:20:21,386
I would like to get a glass of water.

463
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:22,888
Come on, Fred.

464
00:20:23,388 --> 00:20:24,389
What's a matter, sonny?

465
00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:26,458
Can't you carry a glass of water by
yourself?

466
00:20:26,458 --> 00:20:28,727
Let's get out of here while we got a
chance.

467
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:30,229
Wait, wait, wait a minute.

468
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:32,231
Wait for what?
Come back here.

469
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:33,232
Did you notice that she knew

470
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:34,733
exactly where the cigarettes were

471
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:36,134
and the matches, too?

472
00:20:36,134 --> 00:20:37,736
Yeah, that was kind of funny, wasn't
it?

473
00:20:37,736 --> 00:20:41,640
You know who those two creeps are in
there?

474
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:43,659
That's Lucy and Ethel.

475
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:46,495
Oh, no, I'd know my own wife,
wouldn't I?

476
00:20:46,495 --> 00:20:47,496
I bet you Fred.

477
00:20:47,496 --> 00:20:48,497
No.

478
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:54,002
By gosh, it is Ethel.

479
00:20:56,505 --> 00:20:58,006
What do they think they're getting
away with?

480
00:20:58,006 --> 00:21:00,008
Never mind, look, look, never mind,
never mind.

481
00:21:00,008 --> 00:21:01,510
Just forget it.

482
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:04,012
I got a wonderful idea to get even
with them.

483
00:21:04,513 --> 00:21:05,430
Yeah, what?

484
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:06,315
I'll tell you what we'll do.

485
00:21:06,782 --> 00:21:08,000
We'll turn the tables on them, see.

486
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,002
As soon as we get back in there,
we'll give them

487
00:21:10,002 --> 00:21:12,037
that same wolf treatment they've been
giving us.

488
00:21:12,037 --> 00:21:13,272
Ricky, you're a genius.

489
00:21:13,772 --> 00:21:14,773
Let's go.
Come on.

490
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:17,776
Oh, there you are, Ricky boy.

491
00:21:17,776 --> 00:21:20,279
I've been waiting to pitch a little
woo

492
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:21,747
with you hog-center style.

493
00:21:21,747 --> 00:21:25,417
Okay, only I thought we'd do it Latin
style.

494
00:21:25,417 --> 00:21:27,019
Latin style?

495
00:21:27,019 --> 00:21:28,220
Yeah.

496
00:21:29,454 --> 00:21:30,255
Hey... hey, now, take it easy!

497
00:21:30,656 --> 00:21:31,456
Now wait just a...

498
00:21:31,456 --> 00:21:33,525
Hey, just a minute!

499
00:21:33,525 --> 00:21:35,527
Come here.

500
00:21:35,927 --> 00:21:37,929
Ma!

501
00:21:37,929 --> 00:21:39,965
I'm getting out of here.

502
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:41,183
I'm coming with you!

503
00:21:41,183 --> 00:21:43,135
This smart aleck's trying to unbutton

504
00:21:43,635 --> 00:21:44,636
my high-top shoes.

505
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:48,056
Call us again, Lucy.

506
00:21:48,056 --> 00:21:50,776
Nice to have met you, Ethel.

507
00:21:51,226 --> 00:21:52,227
Why, Fred Mertz!

508
00:21:52,728 --> 00:21:54,229
You knew it all the time!

509
00:21:54,229 --> 00:21:55,731
(guffaws)

510
00:21:55,731 --> 00:21:57,182
Well, not all the time.

511
00:21:57,582 --> 00:21:58,900
You were pretty convincing.

512
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:00,402
(laughing)

513
00:22:02,404 --> 00:22:04,406
Wait a minute, what are we laughing
at?

514
00:22:04,406 --> 00:22:06,908
You two bums were going out with
other women.

515
00:22:06,908 --> 00:22:08,410
Yeah!
Now, now, now, listen, listen.

516
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:09,911
I swear we were only getting dates

517
00:22:09,911 --> 00:22:11,713
to go to the Copa just to keep an eye
on you girls.

518
00:22:12,214 --> 00:22:13,215
Is that the truth?

519
00:22:13,215 --> 00:22:15,167
Upon my honor, passion flower.

520
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:16,668
What do you think?

521
00:22:16,668 --> 00:22:19,137
Now, look, just to convince you that
we're on the level,

522
00:22:19,137 --> 00:22:21,056
you two girls go and change your
clothes

523
00:22:21,056 --> 00:22:22,307
and we'll all go out

524
00:22:22,307 --> 00:22:23,592
and celebrate the Mertz's
anniversary.

525
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:25,844
Right!
Oh, Ricky!

526
00:22:37,939 --> 00:22:40,742
(cheering)

527
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:51,536
Happy anniversary, Ethel.

528
00:22:51,536 --> 00:22:53,038
Thank you, Lucy.

("I Love Lucy" theme song playing)

00:00:22,772 --> 00:00:24,574
More coffee, dear?

3
00:00:26,042 --> 00:00:28,962
Ricky, you want some more coffee?

4
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:35,702
Are your eggs all right, dear?

5
00:00:37,337 --> 00:00:39,622
Are your eggs...

6
00:00:39,622 --> 00:00:40,874
"How are your eggs, Lucy?"

7
00:00:40,874 --> 00:00:42,625
"Oh, they're just fine, thank you."

8
00:00:44,377 --> 00:00:46,046
"Would you care for some more
coffee?"

00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:46,846
"Oh, no, thanks.

00:00:46,846 --> 00:00:47,847
It's just right, thank you."

"Oh! Do you really think so?

13
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:52,685
Oh, thank you."

14
00:00:52,685 --> 00:00:54,421
"Would you care for sugar in your
coffee?"

"Oh, well, thank you, don't mind if I
do."

00:00:59,192 --> 00:01:02,996
You are back there, aren't you?

00:01:37,697 --> 00:01:40,400
(knocking at door)

18
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,001
Answer it, dear.

19
00:01:43,203 --> 00:01:45,605
(knocking continues)

20
00:01:53,613 --> 00:01:56,549
Good morning, is the lady of the
house in?

21
00:01:56,549 --> 00:01:57,951
Luce...!

22
00:02:00,937 --> 00:02:02,338
What are you doing out there?

23
00:02:02,338 --> 00:02:04,624
The least you could do is stay here

24
00:02:04,624 --> 00:02:06,626
and have breakfast with your husband

25
00:02:06,626 --> 00:02:08,428
in the morning.

26
00:02:10,563 --> 00:02:13,233
Oh, I only got ten minutes to get to
rehearsal.

27
00:02:13,233 --> 00:02:15,018
Bye, honey.
I'll see you for dinner.

28
00:02:31,868 --> 00:02:33,086
Morning, Lucy.

29
00:02:33,086 --> 00:02:34,404
(angrily): Hello!

30
00:02:37,407 --> 00:02:38,408
How are things?

31
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:40,910
Just fine.

32
00:02:59,896 --> 00:03:02,398
What's the matter, aren't you hungry?

33
00:03:02,398 --> 00:03:04,184
Somebody's disposition

34
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:07,153
got up on the wrong side of the bed
this morning.

35
00:03:07,153 --> 00:03:09,322
Did you and Ricky have words?

36
00:03:09,322 --> 00:03:11,824
We had words all right, but they were
all mine.

37
00:03:11,824 --> 00:03:14,327
I'm sick and tired of eating
breakfast

38
00:03:14,327 --> 00:03:15,828
opposite a newspaper.

39
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,087
Does Ricky hide behind his newspaper
in the morning?

40
00:03:24,087 --> 00:03:25,588
He certainly does!

41
00:03:25,588 --> 00:03:26,539
Does he ignore you

42
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:28,541
and refuse to answer questions?

43
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:29,342
Exactly.

44
00:03:29,342 --> 00:03:32,478
Well, this is a case for Dr.
Humphries.

45
00:03:32,478 --> 00:03:33,930
Dr. Who-phries?

46
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:35,782
Dr. Humphries-- he just wrote a book

47
00:03:35,782 --> 00:03:38,284
called How to Keep the Honeymoon From
Ending.

48
00:03:38,284 --> 00:03:39,586
Is that a "Book of the Week"
selection?

49
00:03:39,586 --> 00:03:41,287
Uh-huh.
We have that book.

50
00:03:41,287 --> 00:03:42,956
Well, you should read it.

51
00:03:42,956 --> 00:03:45,758
Why? What could Dr. Humphries
possibly know about Ricky?

52
00:03:45,758 --> 00:03:46,960
I'll show you.

53
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,194
Where's the book?

54
00:03:48,194 --> 00:03:49,996
Over there on the desk, I guess.

55
00:03:49,996 --> 00:03:51,781
Well, now... let's see.

56
00:03:51,781 --> 00:03:56,286
Here: "Chapter One: When Love is on
the Wane.

57
00:03:56,286 --> 00:03:57,287
"Often after the first years of
marriage,

58
00:03:57,287 --> 00:03:59,789
"the husband seems to lose interest
in the wife.

00:03:59,789 --> 00:04:02,342
"He reads the paper at the breakfast
table.

60
00:04:02,342 --> 00:04:04,744
"He doesn't answer when you talk to
him.

61
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:06,846
"In short, he doesn't seem

62
00:04:06,846 --> 00:04:08,881
to know you are alive."

63
00:04:08,881 --> 00:04:12,986
I wonder where Dr. Humphries ever met
Ricky.

64
00:04:14,587 --> 00:04:16,189
"More than likely,

65
00:04:16,189 --> 00:04:19,342
this unfortunate condition is the
fault of the wife."

66
00:04:19,342 --> 00:04:20,643
What?!

67
00:04:21,644 --> 00:04:24,130
That's a lot of nonsense.

68
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:26,899
"Contrary to what some wives may
think,

69
00:04:26,899 --> 00:04:28,901
this is not a lot of nonsense."

70
00:04:30,503 --> 00:04:31,704
Well.

71
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:34,741
"Research shows that this condition
starts

72
00:04:34,741 --> 00:04:36,709
"when the wife becomes careless

73
00:04:36,709 --> 00:04:38,311
"about her appearance.

74
00:04:38,311 --> 00:04:40,530
"Let her ask herself these questions:

75
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:42,231
"Does she come to breakfast

76
00:04:42,231 --> 00:04:44,250
with her hair in curlers?"

77
00:04:47,153 --> 00:04:50,957
"Is she sloppy in her attire?"

78
00:05:00,266 --> 00:05:02,669
"Does she forget to make up her
face?"

79
00:05:04,771 --> 00:05:07,807
"Is the answer to these questions
'Yes'?

80
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:09,475
"Then it is time

81
00:05:09,475 --> 00:05:11,878
for the wife to do something about
it."

82
00:05:11,878 --> 00:05:13,079
What?

83
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:15,214
"Dress up for your husband at
breakfast.

"he not only will pay attention to
you during breakfast,

he won't even want to leave for the
office."

88
00:05:23,623 --> 00:05:24,524
I'll do it.

89
00:05:24,524 --> 00:05:26,909
Tomorrow morning, I'll be simply
dazzling.

00:05:50,283 --> 00:05:53,886
Good morning, Ricky darling.

00:06:01,944 --> 00:06:05,031
More coffee, Ricky darling?

Cream?

Jam on your toast, sweetheart?

95
00:06:25,284 --> 00:06:27,637
I want a divorce.

96
00:06:27,637 --> 00:06:29,939
That's nice, dear.

97
00:06:43,703 --> 00:06:45,204
Fuego! Fuego! Fuego!

98
00:06:45,204 --> 00:06:46,205
Lucy, get out!

99
00:06:46,205 --> 00:06:49,208
Fire! Fire!

100
00:06:53,713 --> 00:06:54,714
What's the matter with you?

101
00:06:54,714 --> 00:06:56,215
You crazy or something?

102
00:06:56,215 --> 00:06:57,717
Look at me.

103
00:06:59,218 --> 00:07:00,219
Well?

104
00:07:00,219 --> 00:07:01,220
Well?

105
00:07:03,222 --> 00:07:05,224
You don't look so good.

106
00:07:07,009 --> 00:07:08,978
Let me see your tongue.

107
00:07:08,978 --> 00:07:10,480
Say "Ah."

108
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:12,165
Ah.

109
00:07:12,165 --> 00:07:14,167
I think you better go and see a
doctor.

110
00:07:14,167 --> 00:07:16,102
There's nothing the matter with me.

111
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:17,437
Are you sure?

112
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:18,404
Yes, I'm sure.

113
00:07:18,905 --> 00:07:19,906
Well, thank goodness.

114
00:07:19,906 --> 00:07:22,191
Good-bye, sweetheart.
Got to go.

115
00:07:27,196 --> 00:07:29,198
But Ricky...

116
00:07:29,198 --> 00:07:33,202
Oh, Ethel and that stale book of
hers.

117
00:07:42,678 --> 00:07:44,180
Hello.

118
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:46,799
Hello, Ethel, what you doing?

119
00:07:46,799 --> 00:07:49,051
I'm eating a donut.

120
00:07:49,051 --> 00:07:52,772
Well, come on up here and have coffee
with me, will you?

121
00:07:52,772 --> 00:07:55,575
What are you talking about?

122
00:07:55,575 --> 00:07:59,479
I can't understand you; will you talk
into the phone?

123
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:00,480
What?

124
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:03,983
Oh, hi, Ethel, I'll be with you in a
minute.

125
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:07,403
I got to hang up now, Ethel, Ethel's
here.

126
00:08:08,404 --> 00:08:09,906
(screams)

127
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:12,909
I've been here all along.

128
00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:14,410
Oh.

129
00:08:16,062 --> 00:08:17,463
Gee, you look great.

130
00:08:17,463 --> 00:08:18,965
Thank you.

131
00:08:18,965 --> 00:08:20,967
Well, is everything okey-dokey?

132
00:08:20,967 --> 00:08:23,469
No, everything is inky-stinky.

133
00:08:23,469 --> 00:08:24,470
What happened?

134
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:26,973
Nothing! He didn't even notice me.

135
00:08:26,973 --> 00:08:27,974
Oh, I'm sorry.

136
00:08:27,974 --> 00:08:29,976
I can't imagine why it didn't work.

137
00:08:29,976 --> 00:08:32,762
Well, let's see what Dr. Humphries
has to say.

138
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:35,264
Oh, forget that tired Dr. Humphries.

139
00:08:35,264 --> 00:08:36,766
"Be glamorous in the morning.

140
00:08:36,766 --> 00:08:38,267
"Be sophisticated.

141
00:08:38,267 --> 00:08:39,769
This method cannot fail."

142
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:40,770
Ha! Ha!

143
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:41,771
Now, just a minute.

144
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:43,773
Let's look at chapter two.

145
00:08:43,773 --> 00:08:45,775
"If the method in chapter one
fails--"

146
00:08:46,275 --> 00:08:47,276
And it did.

147
00:08:47,693 --> 00:08:49,695
"If the method in chapter one fails,

148
00:08:49,695 --> 00:08:51,697
you should next try the 'Be a Pal'
system."

149
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:53,950
"'Be a Pal' system"?

150
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:55,451
"Share your husband's interests.

151
00:08:55,451 --> 00:08:57,370
"Join in his hobbies.

152
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:58,971
"If he hunts, take up hunting.

153
00:08:58,971 --> 00:09:00,723
"If he fishes, take up fishing.

154
00:09:00,723 --> 00:09:01,707
If he golfs, take up golfing."

155
00:09:01,707 --> 00:09:05,945
Ricky plays poker-- I'll have to take
up poking.

156
00:09:05,945 --> 00:09:07,964
Hey, Ricky's playing tonight, isn't
he?

157
00:09:08,464 --> 00:09:10,082
Yeah, with Fred and the boys

158
00:09:10,082 --> 00:09:11,284
down in our apartment.

159
00:09:11,684 --> 00:09:13,102
I'm joining that game.

160
00:09:13,102 --> 00:09:14,103
Attagirl.

161
00:09:14,103 --> 00:09:15,104
Oh, wait a minute.

162
00:09:15,104 --> 00:09:16,989
I don't know how to play poker.

163
00:09:16,989 --> 00:09:19,592
So what? I can teach you in a couple
of hours.

164
00:09:19,592 --> 00:09:21,027
Okay, how do we start?

165
00:09:21,027 --> 00:09:23,529
Well, it's a lot like hearts,

166
00:09:23,529 --> 00:09:25,014
only you bet

167
00:09:25,014 --> 00:09:27,783
and there isn't any old maid.

168
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:38,844
Aces and tens.

169
00:09:38,844 --> 00:09:40,913
Hold it, Curly.

170
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:43,049
Three ladies.

171
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,002
Your deal, Charlie.

172
00:09:46,002 --> 00:09:47,003
Hiya, fellas.

173
00:09:54,810 --> 00:09:56,812
Hiya, Charlie.
Hiya, Hank.

174
00:09:56,812 --> 00:09:58,314
Hello.

175
00:09:58,314 --> 00:09:59,815
Lucy, what's going on?

176
00:09:59,815 --> 00:10:02,318
Well, thought I'd join the game, if
you guys don't mind.

177
00:10:02,818 --> 00:10:03,819
CHARLIE: Well...

178
00:10:03,819 --> 00:10:05,321
What goes?

179
00:10:05,321 --> 00:10:06,322
Look, honey, we'd love to play with
you,

180
00:10:06,322 --> 00:10:07,823
but you don't know how to play poker.

181
00:10:07,823 --> 00:10:08,824
Oh, yes, I do.

182
00:10:08,824 --> 00:10:10,826
Ethel taught me this afternoon.

183
00:10:10,826 --> 00:10:12,328
Oh, no!

184
00:10:13,329 --> 00:10:14,947
Honey, please, now, we're trying...

185
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:16,666
I'll just sit right in here.

186
00:10:16,666 --> 00:10:18,668
Could you move over a bit, Hank?

187
00:10:18,668 --> 00:10:19,669
Thanks a lot.
Thank you.

188
00:10:21,671 --> 00:10:23,673
You mind, Hank?

189
00:10:23,673 --> 00:10:26,125
Not really.

190
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:27,126
You fellas?

191
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:28,527
I guess not.

192
00:10:28,527 --> 00:10:29,879
Well, go on.

193
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:32,164
Deal the cards, Charlie.
Deal 'em!

194
00:10:33,933 --> 00:10:37,720
I don't have any of those little
round things.

195
00:10:39,221 --> 00:10:41,223
Here, I'll finance you.

196
00:10:41,223 --> 00:10:42,224
Oh, is this money?

197
00:10:42,224 --> 00:10:43,726
Ooh!

198
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:49,231
Ooh! A queen.

199
00:10:50,733 --> 00:10:53,235
There's her sister.

200
00:10:54,236 --> 00:10:55,738
Honey, you're supposed

201
00:10:55,738 --> 00:10:57,239
to keep your cards a secret.

202
00:10:57,239 --> 00:10:58,240
Oh.

203
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,725
Ooh!

204
00:10:59,725 --> 00:11:00,926
What'd you get, Fred?
What'd you get?

205
00:11:00,926 --> 00:11:02,294
Well, I shouldn't talk,

206
00:11:02,294 --> 00:11:05,097
but you can tell your two Andrews
Sisters

207
00:11:05,097 --> 00:11:06,999
not to wait up for Laverne.

208
00:11:09,802 --> 00:11:12,805
I'll open for two.

209
00:11:12,805 --> 00:11:14,306
I'm in.

210
00:11:16,308 --> 00:11:17,810
(clears throat)

211
00:11:18,811 --> 00:11:20,813
Honey, if you want to stay in the
pot,

212
00:11:20,813 --> 00:11:22,815
you've got to put in two chips.

213
00:11:22,815 --> 00:11:24,316
Oh, oh.

214
00:11:28,821 --> 00:11:30,606
Cards?

215
00:11:30,606 --> 00:11:31,607
Two.

216
00:11:31,607 --> 00:11:32,608
Two.

217
00:11:32,608 --> 00:11:34,110
Three for me, please.

218
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:36,112
Three.

219
00:11:37,113 --> 00:11:39,965
(clears throat)

220
00:11:39,965 --> 00:11:41,867
How many cards you want, Lucy?

221
00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:43,869
Oh, do I get more?

222
00:11:43,869 --> 00:11:44,870
Honey, you've got

223
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:46,872
to get rid of your worst cards

224
00:11:46,872 --> 00:11:48,374
in order to get new ones.

225
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:51,377
Oh, my!
This is a problem.

226
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:56,882
Honey, please, you're holding up the
game.

227
00:11:56,882 --> 00:11:57,883
Well, I can't decide

228
00:11:57,883 --> 00:11:59,919
whether to throw away my two queens

229
00:12:00,319 --> 00:12:01,520
or my three kings.

230
00:12:07,476 --> 00:12:09,979
What are you doing that for?

231
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:12,264
'Cause as much as we hate to admit
it, you won.

232
00:12:12,264 --> 00:12:14,150
I did?

233
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:15,651
Hey, this is fun.

234
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:18,654
You deal, Hank.

235
00:12:18,654 --> 00:12:20,656
I think I'll deal this one, fellas.

236
00:12:20,656 --> 00:12:22,158
Lucy, it's his...

237
00:12:32,885 --> 00:12:34,887
I'll fix it.

238
00:12:35,888 --> 00:12:37,389
You got your five?
Yeah.

239
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:38,891
I got my five.

240
00:12:38,891 --> 00:12:40,392
Everybody got their cards?

241
00:12:40,392 --> 00:12:41,894
Thank you.

242
00:12:49,685 --> 00:12:51,187
There.

243
00:12:51,187 --> 00:12:53,689
I open for two.

244
00:12:53,689 --> 00:12:55,941
I'm in.

245
00:12:55,941 --> 00:12:57,443
I'll stay.

246
00:12:57,443 --> 00:12:58,944
Oh, excuse me.

247
00:12:58,944 --> 00:13:00,446
I'm in.

248
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:02,948
(clears throat)

249
00:13:02,948 --> 00:13:04,450
Oh.

250
00:13:07,953 --> 00:13:09,955
Cards, honey.
Cards, please.

251
00:13:09,955 --> 00:13:11,457
Oh.

252
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:13,459
No, the other way around, dear.

253
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:14,460
I'm fine.

254
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:16,796
You look tired.

255
00:13:19,682 --> 00:13:20,683
Two.

256
00:13:23,686 --> 00:13:25,187
Two.

257
00:13:26,689 --> 00:13:28,691
Three for me, please.

258
00:13:31,694 --> 00:13:33,696
I'll take four.

259
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:55,501
(clears throat)

260
00:13:57,503 --> 00:13:58,504
I bet three.

261
00:13:58,504 --> 00:13:59,722
I'm out.

262
00:13:59,722 --> 00:14:00,723
Me, too.

263
00:14:00,723 --> 00:14:02,808
I'm folding.

264
00:14:02,808 --> 00:14:05,427
How about you, Peeping Tom?

265
00:14:05,427 --> 00:14:07,680
Well, I'll bet five.

266
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,682
Oh, you're raising me?

267
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:10,683
I am?

268
00:14:12,484 --> 00:14:15,437
There's your raise, and I'll raise
you two.

269
00:14:15,437 --> 00:14:19,191
Well, there's your raise, and I'll
raise you three.

270
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:23,445
There's your raise, and I'll raise
you four.

271
00:14:23,445 --> 00:14:27,433
Well, there's your raise, and I'll
raise you...

272
00:14:27,433 --> 00:14:28,250
Ricky?

273
00:14:28,751 --> 00:14:29,752
What?

274
00:14:29,752 --> 00:14:31,871
Run over it for me, will you?

275
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:33,122
Run over what?

276
00:14:33,122 --> 00:14:35,591
You know, what beats what.

277
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:40,379
Two pairs beat a pair.

278
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:43,132
Go on.

279
00:14:43,132 --> 00:14:45,935
Three of a kind beats two pair.

280
00:14:45,935 --> 00:14:46,936
Go on.

281
00:14:46,936 --> 00:14:48,938
MEN: A straight beats three of a
kind.

282
00:14:48,938 --> 00:14:50,439
Go on.

283
00:14:50,439 --> 00:14:52,725
A flush beats a straight.

284
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:53,726
Go on.

285
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:56,228
A full house beats a flush.

286
00:14:56,228 --> 00:14:57,730
Go on.

287
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:59,732
Four of a kind beats a full house.

288
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:01,734
That's the one!

289
00:15:06,956 --> 00:15:08,240
They're all yours.

290
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,242
Whee!

291
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:13,545
Oh, boy.

292
00:15:13,545 --> 00:15:15,547
Honey, just out of curiosity

293
00:15:15,547 --> 00:15:17,549
what were your four of a kind?

294
00:15:17,549 --> 00:15:18,951
I didn't have four of a kind,

295
00:15:18,951 --> 00:15:20,336
I had a pair.

296
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:22,838
(groans)

297
00:15:22,838 --> 00:15:25,841
Sure... see?
Two nines.

298
00:15:27,843 --> 00:15:28,844
Lucy?

299
00:15:28,844 --> 00:15:29,845
Yeah.

300
00:15:29,845 --> 00:15:30,846
This one is a nine...

301
00:15:31,347 --> 00:15:31,847
Uh-huh.

302
00:15:32,348 --> 00:15:33,849
And this one is a six.

303
00:15:33,849 --> 00:15:35,351
(groans)

304
00:15:35,351 --> 00:15:37,853
Oh, what do you know about that.

305
00:15:38,354 --> 00:15:40,356
I didn't even have a pair.

306
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:42,358
Isn't that funny?

307
00:15:42,358 --> 00:15:45,160
Gee, this is fun.

308
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:47,162
Let's play a wild game.

309
00:15:47,162 --> 00:15:49,665
Everything wild but the old maid.

310
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:00,509
Oh, forget that book, will you?

311
00:16:00,509 --> 00:16:01,460
As far as I'm concerned,

312
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:03,495
Dr. Humphries can go jump-phrey.

313
00:16:03,495 --> 00:16:05,497
This morning, Ricky didn't even speak
to me.

314
00:16:05,898 --> 00:16:07,967
He hasn't been speaking to you in the
morning for weeks.

315
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:10,469
Well, it was the way he didn't speak
to me.

316
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:12,388
And Dr. Humphries knows why.

317
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:15,024
"Chapter three: One thing to remember

318
00:16:15,024 --> 00:16:17,810
"about the 'Be a Pal' system in
chapter two,

319
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:20,212
"if you play games with your husband

320
00:16:20,212 --> 00:16:21,814
be sure not to beat him."

321
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:24,783
Now he tells me.

322
00:16:24,783 --> 00:16:26,385
"If methods one and two have failed,

323
00:16:26,385 --> 00:16:28,454
"there is one last desperate measure.

324
00:16:28,854 --> 00:16:30,456
I suggest that the wife become a
mother."

325
00:16:30,456 --> 00:16:34,360
I suggest he mind his own business.

326
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:35,160
Now, let me finish.

327
00:16:35,561 --> 00:16:36,762
"Most men marry a woman

328
00:16:36,762 --> 00:16:38,764

329
00:16:38,764 --> 00:16:40,366
"This is because most men

330
00:16:40,366 --> 00:16:41,567

331
00:16:41,567 --> 00:16:43,168
"of their carefree childhood.

332
00:16:43,168 --> 00:16:46,372
So mother your husband; baby him."

333
00:16:46,372 --> 00:16:48,807
Treat Ricky like a baby?

334
00:16:48,807 --> 00:16:50,809
"And surround him with things

335
00:16:50,809 --> 00:16:52,811
that will remind him of his boyhood."

336
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:58,600
I don't think I know

337
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:01,103
how to fold one of these things.

338
00:17:01,103 --> 00:17:02,604
He doesn't mean that.

339
00:17:02,604 --> 00:17:03,605
Oh.

340
00:17:03,605 --> 00:17:05,924
You know, I wouldn't be surprised

341
00:17:05,924 --> 00:17:09,228
if your whole trouble is that Ricky
misses Cuba.

342
00:17:09,228 --> 00:17:11,230
Oh, Ethel, that's ridiculous.

343
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:12,164
No, it isn't.

344
00:17:12,164 --> 00:17:14,066
You should fix this place up

345
00:17:14,066 --> 00:17:15,267
to remind him

346
00:17:15,267 --> 00:17:16,985
of his happy childhood in Cuba.

347
00:17:16,985 --> 00:17:18,737
What do you want me to do,

348
00:17:18,737 --> 00:17:20,739
plant a banana tree in the kitchen?

349
00:17:20,739 --> 00:17:22,741
You'll have to be more drastic than
that.

350
00:17:22,741 --> 00:17:24,777
This time, you really got to shock
him.

351
00:17:24,777 --> 00:17:25,711
You're right.

352
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:26,962
This time, he'll notice me

353
00:17:26,962 --> 00:17:28,614
or I'll know the reason why.

354
00:17:28,614 --> 00:17:29,882
Now, what can we do?

355
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:31,300
Well, what do you know about his
childhood?

356
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:32,985
Well, not very much.

357
00:17:32,985 --> 00:17:35,054
He had five brothers, and his mother

358
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:36,655
was a great singer and dancer.

359
00:17:36,655 --> 00:17:37,523
Perfect!

360
00:17:37,523 --> 00:17:38,824
What do you mean, perfect?

361
00:17:38,824 --> 00:17:39,625
I couldn't remind him of his mother.

362
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:41,226
As a dancer, I got two left feet,

363
00:17:41,226 --> 00:17:43,228
and as a singer, I sound like a bull
moose

364
00:17:43,228 --> 00:17:46,031
pulling his foot out of the mud.

365
00:17:46,031 --> 00:17:47,866
So what? You've got a record player,
haven't you?

366
00:17:47,866 --> 00:17:49,118
Yeah.

367
00:17:49,118 --> 00:17:51,270
Well, we'll buy a record

368
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:53,772
and I'll play it here in the kitchen

369
00:17:53,772 --> 00:17:55,541
while you pretend to...

370
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:56,875
While I pretend to...

371
00:17:56,875 --> 00:17:56,875
That's it.

372
00:17:56,875 --> 00:17:58,877
Aha!

373
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:30,075
Hey, amigo...

374
00:18:30,075 --> 00:18:32,177
Señor?

375
00:18:32,177 --> 00:18:33,378
Clem?

376
00:18:41,887 --> 00:18:42,688

00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:47,559
¿Que paso?

379
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:48,760
Oh, I beg your pardon.

380
00:18:49,211 --> 00:18:51,213
I must be in the wrong apartment.

381
00:18:51,213 --> 00:18:52,931
Oh, no, señor.

382
00:18:52,931 --> 00:18:55,100
This is it, your apartment.

383
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:58,720

How are you, my little cucaracha?

394
00:21:01,893 --> 00:21:06,798
How you like the hacienda, eh?

395
00:21:06,798 --> 00:21:09,151
Lucy, have you gone off your rocker?

Lucy, what's going on?

401
00:21:25,667 --> 00:21:27,169
We have big fiesta--

402
00:21:27,169 --> 00:21:30,756
frijoles, taco, enchilada, tamale,
huevos ranchitas,

403
00:21:30,756 --> 00:21:32,758
guacamole and wacko taco.

404
00:21:32,758 --> 00:21:34,192
Big fiesta!

405
00:21:34,192 --> 00:21:35,427
BOYS: Yay!

406
00:21:35,827 --> 00:21:37,629
Big fiesta!

407
00:21:37,629 --> 00:21:41,099
Lucy, please, would you mind telling
me what's going on?

408
00:21:41,099 --> 00:21:42,601
We make everything nice

409
00:21:42,601 --> 00:21:44,736
like when you little boy in Cuba.

410
00:21:44,736 --> 00:21:46,104
You like?

411
00:21:46,104 --> 00:21:47,306
No, I don't.

412
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:49,558
Oh, you don't?

413
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:52,611
Now, look, would you please explain
to me

414
00:21:52,611 --> 00:21:55,113
what is the idea of all this?

415
00:21:55,113 --> 00:21:57,816
Well, I thought you were getting
tired of me

416
00:21:57,816 --> 00:21:59,818
and if our home reminded you of Cuba

417
00:21:59,818 --> 00:22:01,320
you might like me better.

418
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,822
Oh, honey.

419
00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:05,324
Oh, Lucy darling.

420
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:07,326
If I wanted things Cuban,

421
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:09,094
I'd have stayed in Havana.

422
00:22:09,094 --> 00:22:11,163
That's the reason I married you,

423
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:12,798
because you're so different

424
00:22:12,798 --> 00:22:14,399
from anyone I've known in Cuba.

425
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,568
Who did you know in Cuba?

426
00:22:17,386 --> 00:22:19,388
Come here.

Please, now, please.
No nagging on a full stomach.

8
00:00:37,937 --> 00:00:39,539
Besides, it's your own fault.

9
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:41,141
You put too much food on the table.

10
00:00:41,141 --> 00:00:43,426
You didn't have to eat everything in
sight.

11
00:00:43,426 --> 00:00:45,045
I only ate 12 oysters.

12
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:47,130
16, But who counts?

13
00:00:48,131 --> 00:00:50,600
Fred, did you really eat 16 oysters?

14
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:53,420
You heard what the oyster counter
said.

15
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:54,621
But I was doing it for you.

16
00:00:54,621 --> 00:00:56,523
I was trying to find you a pearl.

17
00:00:56,523 --> 00:00:58,007
Well, don't pick on him.

18
00:00:58,007 --> 00:00:59,909
Ricky ate more oysters than all of us
put together.

19
00:01:00,326 --> 00:01:01,127
Naturally.

20
00:01:01,127 --> 00:01:02,796
LUCY: What do you mean, naturally?

21
00:01:02,796 --> 00:01:05,632
Because I got more Rs in my name than
anyone else.

22
00:01:05,632 --> 00:01:08,568
Anyhow, the way you gals were
shoveling in that food

23
00:01:08,568 --> 00:01:11,371
I thought you were using a conveyor
belt.

24
00:01:11,371 --> 00:01:13,506
Can't help it, eating's my hobby.

25
00:01:13,506 --> 00:01:14,891
Yeah, you ought to watch that, Ethel.

26
00:01:14,891 --> 00:01:16,676
Course, it doesn't matter what I eat

27
00:01:16,676 --> 00:01:18,178
because it doesn't go to fat.

28
00:01:18,178 --> 00:01:20,880
Where does it go to, thin?

29
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,382
For your information, loverboy,

30
00:01:22,382 --> 00:01:23,817
I weigh exactly the same

31
00:01:23,817 --> 00:01:25,819
as I did when we were married.

32
00:01:25,819 --> 00:01:27,020
Ha!

33
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:27,821
Well, I do.

34
00:01:27,821 --> 00:01:30,223
Oh, come now, Lucy.

35
00:01:30,223 --> 00:01:32,225
Ethel and Fred and I have all
admitted

36
00:01:32,225 --> 00:01:34,427
that we're getting a little fat.

37
00:01:34,427 --> 00:01:36,029
A little puffy, perhaps.

38
00:01:36,029 --> 00:01:38,832
Now, why don't you break down and
admit it, too?

39
00:01:38,832 --> 00:01:40,834
Well, I'd be very happy to join your
tubby little trio

40

if it were true, but it isn't.

41

Oh, Lucy, you're among friends.

42
00:01:44,287 --> 00:01:45,288
Let's be honest.

43
00:01:45,288 --> 00:01:46,573
I am honest!

44
00:01:46,573 --> 00:01:48,808
When Ricky and I were married, I
weighed 110,

45
00:01:48,808 --> 00:01:50,577
and I weigh exactly that right now.

46
00:01:50,577 --> 00:01:51,828
We shall see.

47
00:01:51,828 --> 00:01:53,830
Now, don't bother getting those
bathroom scales--

48
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:55,448
they're broken.

49
00:01:55,448 --> 00:01:57,183
I fixed them this morning.

50
00:01:57,183 --> 00:01:58,384
Oh.

51
00:01:58,384 --> 00:02:00,386
Anyway, I'm getting a little bored
with this discussion.

52
00:02:00,386 --> 00:02:01,387
Aren't you?

53
00:02:01,387 --> 00:02:02,388
No.

54
00:02:02,388 --> 00:02:05,492
Oh, whose side are you on anyway?

55
00:02:05,492 --> 00:02:09,095
I'm on the side of Ricky and his
puffy pal.

56
00:02:09,095 --> 00:02:10,430
Okay, on the scales, champ.

57
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:12,198
This I got to see.

58
00:02:12,198 --> 00:02:13,032
Come on, on the scales.
No!

59
00:02:13,032 --> 00:02:14,234
You're the one...
Come on, on the scales.

60
00:02:14,234 --> 00:02:16,236
Oh, now, Ricky.

61
00:02:16,236 --> 00:02:17,437
On the scales.

62
00:02:17,437 --> 00:02:18,238
All right.

63
00:02:18,238 --> 00:02:19,522
How much do I weigh?

64
00:02:19,522 --> 00:02:23,109
45 pounds, and stop leaning on us.

65
00:02:23,109 --> 00:02:24,310
Okay.

66
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:26,446
132?!

67
00:02:26,446 --> 00:02:28,748
On behalf of our tubby trio

68
00:02:28,748 --> 00:02:32,035
I welcome you to our flabby foursome.

69
00:02:33,253 --> 00:02:35,455
Well, now that that's over with.

70
00:02:35,455 --> 00:02:37,957
What are we going to do tonight?

71
00:02:37,957 --> 00:02:39,459
I don't know what you're going to do

72
00:02:39,459 --> 00:02:40,960
but I'm going out and kill myself.

73
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:43,730
Honey, so you gained a little weight.

74
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:44,931
Is that so terrible?

75
00:02:44,931 --> 00:02:46,299
A little weight?

76
00:02:46,299 --> 00:02:49,169
I walked into this room weighing 110.

77
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:50,603
I now weigh 132.

78
00:02:50,603 --> 00:02:53,106
That's 22 pounds in ten minutes.

79
00:02:53,106 --> 00:02:54,908
Aw, Lucy, don't cry about it.

80
00:02:55,308 --> 00:02:58,111
What if I cried every time I gained a
pound?

81
00:02:58,111 --> 00:03:00,914
We'd be up to our ears in tears.

82
00:03:00,914 --> 00:03:02,615
Never mind, Fred.

83
00:03:02,615 --> 00:03:07,020
I'm nothing but a big, bloated bunch
of blubber.

84
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:09,122
Oh, honey, now don't talk that way.

85
00:03:09,122 --> 00:03:11,624
I wouldn't want you any different

86
00:03:11,624 --> 00:03:13,293
than you are just now.

87
00:03:13,293 --> 00:03:14,227
You wouldn't?

88
00:03:14,627 --> 00:03:15,995
No... I like you plump.

89
00:03:15,995 --> 00:03:17,997
(wailing)

90
00:03:17,997 --> 00:03:20,500
I... I didn't mean it like that.

91
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,001
I mean, you look swell!

92
00:03:22,001 --> 00:03:23,803
I'm not worried about you,

93
00:03:23,803 --> 00:03:26,506
but how am I going to look on the
stage?

94
00:03:26,506 --> 00:03:27,373
The stage?

95
00:03:27,373 --> 00:03:28,308
Yes.

96
00:03:28,808 --> 00:03:30,810
Oh, no, you're not going to start
that again, are you?

97
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:31,811
Oh, I know.

98
00:03:31,811 --> 00:03:33,680
You don't want me in show business,

99
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:36,482
but someday, in spite of you,
opportunity will knock

100
00:03:36,482 --> 00:03:37,483
and what'll happen?

101
00:03:37,483 --> 00:03:38,484
I'll be so big and fat

102
00:03:38,484 --> 00:03:41,087
I won't be able to get up and open
the door.

103
00:03:41,087 --> 00:03:41,938
(phone rings)

104
00:03:41,938 --> 00:03:43,189
Oh, honey, forget it.

105
00:03:43,189 --> 00:03:44,691
You look wonderful.

106
00:03:44,691 --> 00:03:45,692
(phone rings)

107
00:03:45,692 --> 00:03:47,727
Hello?

108
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:48,528
Hi, Jerry.

109
00:03:49,946 --> 00:03:51,164
What?

110
00:03:51,164 --> 00:03:52,765
Oh, this is a fine time.

111
00:03:52,765 --> 00:03:55,635
What am I supposed to do-- dance by
myself?

112
00:03:56,836 --> 00:03:58,438
Okay, okay.

113
00:03:58,838 --> 00:04:00,607
Well, look, try to get some girls
lined up

114
00:04:00,607 --> 00:04:03,009
and we'll have auditions in the
morning.

115
00:04:03,009 --> 00:04:04,294
Good-bye.

116
00:04:04,294 --> 00:04:05,612
Oh, hello, Jerry?
Hello...

117
00:04:05,612 --> 00:04:07,964
Listen, Jerry, what was the size

118
00:04:07,964 --> 00:04:11,517
of the new costume you just bought
for Joanne?

119
00:04:11,517 --> 00:04:13,720
Well, get girls that size.

120
00:04:14,153 --> 00:04:15,388
Good-bye.

121
00:04:15,388 --> 00:04:16,773
What's the matter, Ricky?

122
00:04:16,773 --> 00:04:18,024
Joanne is quitting.

123
00:04:18,024 --> 00:04:19,225
Who's Joanne?

124
00:04:19,225 --> 00:04:20,860
Oh, that's terrible.

125
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:22,061
Who's Joanne?

126
00:04:22,061 --> 00:04:23,363
At a time like this, too.

127
00:04:23,363 --> 00:04:24,664
Who's Joanne?

128
00:04:24,664 --> 00:04:25,865
Why did she quit?

129
00:04:25,865 --> 00:04:27,867
Who's Joanne?

130
00:04:27,867 --> 00:04:29,068
She's getting married.

131
00:04:29,068 --> 00:04:30,787
Who's Joanne?

132
00:04:30,787 --> 00:04:32,405
She's the girl that dances with
Ricky.

133
00:04:32,405 --> 00:04:35,541
Now, what was I doing wrong?

134
00:04:40,913 --> 00:04:43,383
Now I got to find a girl who can sing
and dance

135
00:04:43,383 --> 00:04:45,418
and teach her the number by Saturday
night.

136
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:53,343
(humming a merry tune)

137
00:04:53,343 --> 00:04:56,846
I can't think of a soul.

138
00:04:56,846 --> 00:04:59,349
Lucy, will you stop that racket and
let me think?

139
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:02,568
What are you so fidgety about?

140
00:05:02,568 --> 00:05:04,437
Your girdle too tight?

141
00:05:04,437 --> 00:05:06,973
No, I was just about to suggest that
in this very room

142
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:10,026
there's a very pretty and talented
young lady

143
00:05:10,026 --> 00:05:12,028
who is a wonderful singer and dancer.

144
00:05:12,028 --> 00:05:14,530
Who? Ethel?

145
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:15,531
Who? Ethel?

146
00:05:15,531 --> 00:05:16,532
No, not her-- me.

147
00:05:16,532 --> 00:05:18,034
Oh.

148
00:05:18,034 --> 00:05:19,535
Oh, Ricky, this is a wonderful chance
for me.

149
00:05:19,535 --> 00:05:21,037
I know the number.

150
00:05:21,037 --> 00:05:22,538
I can take Joanne's place. Please?

151
00:05:22,538 --> 00:05:24,340
No, that's out of the question.

152
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:25,842
Give me one good reason.

153
00:05:26,309 --> 00:05:27,293
Well, you're...
You're too fat.

154
00:05:27,293 --> 00:05:28,778
Fat?!
You said so yourself.

155
00:05:28,778 --> 00:05:30,196
Plump maybe, but not fat.

156
00:05:30,196 --> 00:05:31,397
Come on, Fred, we'd better go.

157
00:05:31,798 --> 00:05:33,399
No, let's stay and see the fun.

158
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:35,101
Then you won't have to hang out

159
00:05:35,101 --> 00:05:36,436
the bathroom window

160
00:05:36,436 --> 00:05:37,887
to hear what they're saying.

161
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:39,138
Come on.

162
00:05:39,138 --> 00:05:41,074
No, now you two stay right there.

163
00:05:41,074 --> 00:05:42,809
I want you for witnesses.

164
00:05:42,809 --> 00:05:43,810
Ricky Ricardo, I'm asking you

165
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:46,446
to give me the same chance you would
give anyone else.

166
00:05:46,446 --> 00:05:48,197
Let me come down and audition for you

167
00:05:48,197 --> 00:05:49,615
just as if I were a stranger.

168
00:05:49,615 --> 00:05:50,900
You can forget you ever knew me.

169
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:53,720
That's a very tempting offer.

170
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:56,989
Oh, can I audition for you, Ricky?
Can I?

171
00:05:56,989 --> 00:05:58,491
All right, all right.

172
00:05:58,491 --> 00:06:00,493
You can come down and audition in the
morning.

173
00:06:00,493 --> 00:06:02,495
Good! Fred and Ethel, now, you heard
that.
You're witnesses.

174
00:06:02,995 --> 00:06:04,630
But it's gonna be strictly business.

175
00:06:05,081 --> 00:06:07,200
I never saw you before in my life.

176
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,000
Okay, Lucy?

177
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,669
Lucy?

178
00:06:09,669 --> 00:06:10,670
I beg your pardon.

179
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:12,405
Have we been introduced?

180
00:06:15,908 --> 00:06:18,144
(playing piano)

181
00:06:33,242 --> 00:06:34,560
Pardon me, but is this

182
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,163
where Ricky Ricardo is auditioning
girls

183
00:06:37,163 --> 00:06:38,131
for the dance?

184
00:06:38,131 --> 00:06:40,133
Yeah, honey, but if I had known

185
00:06:40,133 --> 00:06:41,734
he wanted older women,

186
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:43,336
I'd have brought my mother.

187
00:06:44,537 --> 00:06:47,090
Don't pay any attention to her,
honey.

188
00:06:56,048 --> 00:06:57,850
I guess we're all auditioning

189
00:06:57,850 --> 00:06:59,352
for the same part, huh?

190
00:06:59,352 --> 00:07:00,853
Can I give you a tip?

191
00:07:00,853 --> 00:07:02,355
Oh, yes.

192
00:07:02,355 --> 00:07:04,524
I've known Ricky Ricardo for a long
time.

193
00:07:04,524 --> 00:07:05,808
Oh?

194
00:07:05,808 --> 00:07:07,026
You're not his type.

195
00:08:05,451 --> 00:08:06,452
Hi, Marco.

196
00:08:06,452 --> 00:08:07,954
Hi, girls.
Sorry to keep you waiting.

197
00:08:07,954 --> 00:08:10,089
Good morning, Mr. Ricardo.

198
00:08:10,089 --> 00:08:12,091
Good morning, Mr. Ricardo.

199
00:08:13,342 --> 00:08:15,344
Now, let's all line up here, please.

200
00:08:15,344 --> 00:08:16,846
Let's all line up.

201
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,718
We might as well get started.

202
00:08:22,718 --> 00:08:24,020
Let's see what you can...

203
00:08:29,475 --> 00:08:31,978
See what you can do.

204
00:08:34,981 --> 00:08:37,483
We'll, uh...
we'll start with a time step.

205
00:08:37,483 --> 00:08:39,485
All right, Marco, go ahead.

206
00:08:39,485 --> 00:08:42,288
(piano plays)

207
00:09:00,973 --> 00:09:04,260
That's fine, that's fine.

208
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:05,761
That's enough for now.
That's enough for now.

209
00:09:05,761 --> 00:09:06,762
That's fine.

210
00:09:06,762 --> 00:09:08,764
All right, girls.
That's fine.

211
00:09:08,764 --> 00:09:12,068
Now, um..., you're all size 12,
aren't you?

212
00:09:12,068 --> 00:09:13,069
DANCERS: Yes.

213
00:09:13,069 --> 00:09:15,571
Uh... yeah.

214
00:09:15,571 --> 00:09:17,273
Well, that's good

215
00:09:17,273 --> 00:09:20,960
because whoever gets the job has to
wear this size-12 costume.

216
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,946
Now, uh... miss...

217
00:09:23,946 --> 00:09:25,448
Uh...?

218
00:09:25,448 --> 00:09:26,949
MacGillicuddy.

219
00:09:26,949 --> 00:09:28,200
MacGillicuddy.

220
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,869
Over here, please.

221
00:09:29,869 --> 00:09:30,836
Yes, sir.

222
00:09:30,836 --> 00:09:32,838
Now, take this costume into the
dressing room and put it on,

223
00:09:32,838 --> 00:09:35,841
and then we'll see what you can do
with the number.

224
00:09:35,841 --> 00:09:36,842
Yes, sir, thank you.

225
00:09:37,343 --> 00:09:38,344
All right.

226
00:09:39,845 --> 00:09:42,281
Miss Macgoullucuddy, uh...

227
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:46,385
how are you coming along?

228
00:09:46,385 --> 00:09:50,890
(strained voice): Oh, I've almost got
the costume on.

229
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:52,525
Well, hurry up.

230
00:09:52,525 --> 00:09:53,726
We're waiting.

231
00:09:53,726 --> 00:09:55,328
I'll be right there.

232
00:09:55,728 --> 00:09:58,230
All I have to do is fasten it.

233
00:09:58,230 --> 00:09:59,532
We're waiting.

234
00:09:59,532 --> 00:10:01,200
Just this one last...

235
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,401
(groans)

236
00:10:02,401 --> 00:10:04,804
(ripping noise)

237
00:10:04,804 --> 00:10:05,788
Oh!

238
00:10:05,788 --> 00:10:08,457
What happened?

239
00:10:23,155 --> 00:10:25,558
It was a very small size 12.

240
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:28,227
Mira lo que lo hizo al vestido.

241
00:10:28,227 --> 00:10:29,729
Mira lo que le paso el vestido.

242
00:10:29,729 --> 00:10:31,230
Me dijo que tenia un size 12

243
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:32,665
y se lo puso, y lo rompio todo

244
00:10:33,065 --> 00:10:34,300
para que se puso el vestido

245
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:35,651
si sabia que no iba a caber?

246
00:10:35,651 --> 00:10:37,103
Gracias.

247
00:10:42,108 --> 00:10:44,110
Now I got to get a new costume.

248
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:45,111
Oh, no, you don't, Mr. Ricardo.

249
00:10:45,111 --> 00:10:46,879
It's only split in the seams.

250
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:47,830
I can sew it up myself.

251
00:10:47,830 --> 00:10:48,831
Now, look, never mind.
Just take it off

252
00:10:48,831 --> 00:10:50,833
and leave it in the dressing room

253
00:10:50,833 --> 00:10:53,019
and don't call us, we'll call you.

254
00:10:53,019 --> 00:10:54,620
Oh, but Mr. Ricardo...
What?

255
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:56,622
If I get thin enough to fit the
dress,

256
00:10:56,622 --> 00:10:57,506
can I have the part?

257
00:10:57,506 --> 00:10:59,458
Look, the number goes in by Saturday.

258
00:10:59,458 --> 00:11:01,861
You couldn't possibly get thin enough
by then.

259
00:11:02,261 --> 00:11:03,062
But if I can, can I?

260
00:11:03,462 --> 00:11:04,764
All right, all right.

261
00:11:04,764 --> 00:11:06,048
Now, good-bye, good-bye.

262
00:11:06,048 --> 00:11:07,550
You heard him, Ethel.

263
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:09,552
If I get thin enough to fit the
dress, I can have the part.

264
00:11:09,552 --> 00:11:11,837
Do you really think you can take off
12 pounds in four days?

265
00:11:12,238 --> 00:11:13,556
I'm going to get rid of this fat

266
00:11:13,556 --> 00:11:14,940
if I have to chop it off with a
cleaver.

267
00:11:28,704 --> 00:11:32,158
(running footsteps)

268
00:11:49,508 --> 00:11:50,476
Hey, wait!

269
00:11:50,476 --> 00:11:52,778
That was the last lap.

270
00:11:52,778 --> 00:11:53,979
Oh, that's great.

271
00:11:53,979 --> 00:11:56,682
You did that in 2½ minutes flat.

272
00:11:56,682 --> 00:11:59,101
You now hold the national indoor
record

273
00:11:59,101 --> 00:12:01,604
for the around-the- fourth-floor
dash.

274
00:12:02,521 --> 00:12:04,123
You've done good work.

275
00:12:04,123 --> 00:12:06,025
You deserve a rest period.

276
00:12:06,025 --> 00:12:08,027
Thanks.

277
00:12:08,027 --> 00:12:10,096
Okay, time's up.

278
00:12:12,248 --> 00:12:13,249
Now, you have time

279
00:12:13,249 --> 00:12:15,034
to jump this rope 500 times

280
00:12:15,034 --> 00:12:17,036
before the boys come home for dinner.

281
00:12:18,804 --> 00:12:20,790
Two hundred?

282
00:12:21,290 --> 00:12:22,291
One hundred?

283
00:12:22,291 --> 00:12:25,845
Well, do as many as you can.

284
00:12:34,770 --> 00:12:37,773
Uh... one!

285
00:12:37,773 --> 00:12:39,775
Uh... two!

286
00:12:39,775 --> 00:12:40,776
Uh... higher!

287
00:12:46,565 --> 00:12:48,033
Oh, you poor little thing.

288
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:50,169
You've worked very hard.

289
00:12:50,169 --> 00:12:51,537
Let's weigh you in.

290
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:05,584
Come on.

291
00:13:05,584 --> 00:13:08,621
(grunts)

292
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:10,623
Stiffen up, Lucy.

293
00:13:12,591 --> 00:13:13,926
(gasps)

294
00:13:13,926 --> 00:13:16,595
Another five ounces.

295
00:13:17,596 --> 00:13:20,316
In three days, you've lost almost two
pounds.

296
00:13:20,316 --> 00:13:21,667
Keen.

297
00:13:21,667 --> 00:13:23,269
Oh, don't get discouraged.

298
00:13:23,269 --> 00:13:24,937
Only ten pounds more to go.

299
00:13:24,937 --> 00:13:26,922
We'll get you into size 12.

300
00:13:26,922 --> 00:13:29,909
Yeah, a size-12 shroud.

301
00:13:29,909 --> 00:13:32,695
Now, take a shower and clean up.

302
00:13:35,447 --> 00:13:38,350
I'll get dinner.

303
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:39,552
Dinner?

304
00:13:43,522 --> 00:13:45,758
Okay.

305
00:13:52,047 --> 00:13:53,365
What's the matter?

306
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:55,034
I can't seem to move.

307
00:13:55,034 --> 00:13:57,970
Could you point me in the right
direction?

308
00:14:05,444 --> 00:14:06,445
Thanks.

309
00:14:14,486 --> 00:14:15,988
Here you are, Ricky.

310
00:14:15,988 --> 00:14:16,989
Oh, thank you.

311
00:14:16,989 --> 00:14:19,208
Here you are, Fred, a nice juicy
steak.

312
00:14:19,708 --> 00:14:21,210
Oh, I love steak.

313
00:14:23,712 --> 00:14:26,065
I hope you don't mind us bringing
Butch along?

314
00:14:26,065 --> 00:14:26,999
Not at all.

315
00:14:26,999 --> 00:14:29,001
If he behaves himself, we'll give him
the bone.

316
00:14:29,001 --> 00:14:30,002
Oh, he's a good dog.
Best dog in the...

317
00:14:30,002 --> 00:14:31,437
Here you are, Lucy.

318
00:14:31,437 --> 00:14:34,807
Oh, no, that's yours.

319
00:14:52,825 --> 00:14:54,226
How's your steak, Fred?

320
00:14:54,226 --> 00:14:56,612
Perfect-- just the way I like it.

321
00:14:56,612 --> 00:14:57,963
Is your steak all right, Ricky?

322
00:14:58,364 --> 00:14:59,748
Oh, delicious.
How's yours?

323
00:14:59,748 --> 00:15:01,250
Fine, nice and tender.
Good.

324
00:15:03,035 --> 00:15:05,137
How's your celery, Lucy?

325
00:15:05,137 --> 00:15:07,089
Oh, delicious, thanks.

326
00:15:07,089 --> 00:15:08,591
Is it cooked enough for you?

327
00:15:08,591 --> 00:15:12,094
Oh, yes, just the way I like it, nice
and tender.

328
00:15:12,094 --> 00:15:14,096
Will you pass the potatoes, Rick?

329
00:15:14,096 --> 00:15:15,598
Sure thing, here you go.

330
00:15:15,598 --> 00:15:16,882
Thanks.

331
00:15:16,882 --> 00:15:18,384
Oh, could I have a biscuit, Fred?

332
00:15:18,384 --> 00:15:20,386
Sure, you can have a biscuit.

333
00:15:20,386 --> 00:15:21,387
Excuse me.

334
00:15:21,387 --> 00:15:22,721
Thank you.

335
00:15:22,721 --> 00:15:23,689
Want a biscuit, Ricky?

336
00:15:23,689 --> 00:15:24,657
Mm-hmm.

337
00:15:24,657 --> 00:15:25,975
Thank you.

338
00:15:25,975 --> 00:15:28,978
Hey, Fred, could I have the potatoes
back, please?

339
00:15:28,978 --> 00:15:30,479
Sure, you may.

340
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:46,412
Thank you, Fred.

341
00:15:46,412 --> 00:15:48,414
You know, I'm forgetting about poor,
old Butch.

342
00:15:48,414 --> 00:15:50,416
Hey, yeah, don't forget about him.

343
00:15:50,416 --> 00:15:51,817
I'm going to give him

344
00:15:51,817 --> 00:15:53,819
a nice, juicy piece of this steak.

345
00:15:53,819 --> 00:15:55,020
Do you mind?
Go ahead.

346
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:56,221
Come on, Butch.

347
00:15:56,221 --> 00:15:57,089
Sit up there, boy.

348
00:15:57,089 --> 00:15:58,590
There you are.

349
00:15:58,590 --> 00:15:59,591
Sit up now.

350
00:15:59,591 --> 00:16:00,592
There you go.

351
00:16:00,592 --> 00:16:02,895
You going to thank me?

352
00:16:02,895 --> 00:16:04,563
Huh?

353
00:16:04,563 --> 00:16:06,432
Well, I can't stand anymore.

354
00:16:06,432 --> 00:16:08,434
I'll be back later.

355
00:16:08,934 --> 00:16:11,937
ETHEL: Ah! Stay out of the kitchen.

356
00:16:11,937 --> 00:16:14,440
FRED: How about another biscuit,
Ethel?

357
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:15,441
ETHEL: Uh-huh.

358
00:16:15,441 --> 00:16:16,442
There you are.

359
00:16:16,442 --> 00:16:17,943
RICKY: Hey, Fred,

360
00:16:17,943 --> 00:16:19,945
string beans?

361
00:16:19,945 --> 00:16:23,449
FRED: Sure, these are good for you.

362
00:16:23,449 --> 00:16:24,950
Full of iron.

363
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:26,452
ETHEL: There you are, Ricky.

364
00:16:26,452 --> 00:16:27,953
RICKY: Thank you.

365
00:16:30,956 --> 00:16:32,958
Hey, I didn't give Butch anything.

366
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:35,461
Here you are, Butch.

367
00:16:36,462 --> 00:16:37,963
Aren't you going to thank me?

368
00:16:42,968 --> 00:16:44,970
Nice Butch, nice Butch.

369
00:16:48,474 --> 00:16:50,109
(Lucy growls and barks)

370
00:16:50,109 --> 00:16:52,478
Who's under there?

371
00:16:59,485 --> 00:17:01,387
RICKY: Who's under the table?

372
00:17:01,387 --> 00:17:03,455
Nobody here but us dogs.

373
00:17:07,543 --> 00:17:09,044
Lucy.

374
00:17:09,044 --> 00:17:11,296
Come out from under the table.

375
00:17:13,499 --> 00:17:16,502
Now, what do you got to say for
yourself?

376
00:17:16,502 --> 00:17:18,003
(barks)

377
00:17:18,003 --> 00:17:19,505
Lucy.

378
00:17:19,505 --> 00:17:23,008
All right, you don't have to get
nasty about it, I'm leaving.

379
00:17:23,008 --> 00:17:24,510
Where are you going?

380
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:27,012
I'm going down to the corner bakery

381
00:17:27,012 --> 00:17:28,013
and smell the bread.

382
00:17:37,589 --> 00:17:41,326
Okay, Lucy, let's get started on our
road work for the day.

383
00:17:41,326 --> 00:17:42,327
What's that?

384
00:17:42,327 --> 00:17:44,296
A human pressure cooker.

385
00:17:44,296 --> 00:17:45,581
Where'd you get it?

386
00:17:45,581 --> 00:17:46,532
I rented it.

387
00:17:46,532 --> 00:17:48,283
You really are determined, aren't
you?

388
00:17:48,283 --> 00:17:49,785
Of course-- I'm going to do

389
00:17:49,785 --> 00:17:51,787
that number with Ricky tonight.

390
00:17:51,787 --> 00:17:53,639
Did you lose enough weight?

391
00:17:53,639 --> 00:17:55,808
I've got five more pounds to lose

392
00:17:55,808 --> 00:17:57,409
and five hours to do it in.

393
00:17:57,409 --> 00:17:58,610
This is my last day.

394
00:17:58,610 --> 00:18:00,763
If you spend five hours in that

395
00:18:00,763 --> 00:18:02,714
it really will be your last day.

396
00:18:02,714 --> 00:18:04,466
Well, it's my only chance, Ethel.

397
00:18:04,466 --> 00:18:06,969
Okay, I only hope you know what
you're doing.

398
00:18:06,969 --> 00:18:08,470
I do.

399
00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:09,772
Check me at 6:00 tonight.

400
00:18:09,772 --> 00:18:12,091
You're not really going to spend

401
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:13,292
all that time in there?

402
00:18:13,292 --> 00:18:14,493
I certainly am.

403
00:18:14,493 --> 00:18:15,978
All right.

404
00:18:15,978 --> 00:18:18,480
They'll have to pick you up with a
blotter.

405
00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:22,117
Okay, honey, it's 6:00.

406
00:18:22,117 --> 00:18:23,619
How are you doing?

407
00:18:23,619 --> 00:18:25,120
Lucy!

408
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,472
Where are you?

409
00:18:26,472 --> 00:18:28,874
Lucy!

410
00:18:28,874 --> 00:18:31,376
Lucy.

411
00:18:34,146 --> 00:18:36,148
Is this all that's left?

412
00:18:36,148 --> 00:18:38,550
Practically.

413
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:41,053
Oh, Lucy, you gave me an awful
fright.

414
00:18:41,053 --> 00:18:43,055
Thank heavens you're here.

415
00:18:43,055 --> 00:18:44,356
I'm here, all right.

416
00:18:44,356 --> 00:18:45,591
120 pounds of me.

417
00:18:45,591 --> 00:18:46,809
You did it.

418
00:18:46,809 --> 00:18:48,894
I'm going down to the club and do
that number.

419
00:18:48,894 --> 00:18:50,929
What about that other girl Ricky
hired?

420
00:18:50,929 --> 00:18:53,232
I'll take care of her somehow.

421
00:18:54,733 --> 00:18:57,236
Do you really think you can make it?

422
00:18:57,236 --> 00:18:58,237
Oh, don't worry.

423
00:18:58,237 --> 00:19:02,524
I'm as strong as...
as a very weak horse

424
00:19:02,524 --> 00:19:04,526
but I'll make it.

425
00:19:09,281 --> 00:19:11,283
(band starts a rumba)

426
00:19:16,889 --> 00:19:19,291
They call me Cuban Pete

427
00:19:19,291 --> 00:19:21,293
I'm the king of the rumba beat

428
00:19:21,293 --> 00:19:23,295
When I play the maracas

429
00:19:23,295 --> 00:19:26,131
I go chick-chicky-boom,
chick-chicky-boom

430
00:19:26,131 --> 00:19:27,933
Yes, sir, I'm Cuban Pete

431
00:19:27,933 --> 00:19:29,935
I'm the craze of my native street

432
00:19:30,435 --> 00:19:31,837
When I start to dance

433
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:35,207
Everything goes chick-chicky- boom,
chick-chicky-boom

434
00:19:35,607 --> 00:19:38,527
There's señoritas, they sing and how
they swing

435
00:19:38,527 --> 00:19:39,845
With this rumbero

436
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:41,813
It's very nice

437
00:19:41,813 --> 00:19:44,316
So full of spice

438
00:19:44,316 --> 00:19:46,318
And when they're dancing

439
00:19:46,318 --> 00:19:49,321
They bring a happy ring of vaqueros

440
00:19:49,321 --> 00:19:52,824
Singing a song all the day long

441
00:19:53,325 --> 00:19:57,629
So if you like the beat, take a
lesson from Cuban Pete

442
00:19:57,629 --> 00:19:59,631
And I'll teach you to
chick-chicky-boom

443
00:19:59,631 --> 00:20:01,633
Chick-chicky-boom, chick-chicky-boom

444
00:20:02,134 --> 00:20:03,385
Si, señorita, I know

445
00:20:03,385 --> 00:20:06,738
That you will like the
chicky-boom-chick

446
00:20:06,738 --> 00:20:11,143
Because it's the dance of Latin
romance

447
00:20:11,143 --> 00:20:13,946
And Cuban Pete doesn't teach you in a
hurry

448
00:20:13,946 --> 00:20:15,547
Like Arthur Murray

449
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:19,902
I come from Havana and there's always
mañana.

450
00:20:20,402 --> 00:20:22,404
So señorita...

451
00:20:29,861 --> 00:20:31,863
Oh, no.

452
00:20:35,334 --> 00:20:37,669
They call me Sally Sweet

453
00:20:37,669 --> 00:20:39,972
I'm the queen of Delancy Street

454
00:20:40,372 --> 00:20:41,373
When I start to dance

455
00:20:41,373 --> 00:20:42,874
Everything goes chick-chicky-boom

456
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:44,376
Chick-chicky-boom.

457
00:20:44,376 --> 00:20:47,679
Ay-ya-ya-ya-ya.

458
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:49,014
Excuse me, Mr. Pete.

459
00:20:49,014 --> 00:20:50,382
Yes, ma'am.

460
00:20:50,382 --> 00:20:52,384
Have the Cubans a different beat?

461
00:20:52,384 --> 00:20:54,686
If they have, will you teach me

462
00:20:54,686 --> 00:20:57,689
To chick-chicky-boom
chick-chicky-boom?

463
00:20:57,689 --> 00:20:58,957
Si, señorita

464
00:20:58,957 --> 00:21:00,158
I know that you will like

465
00:21:00,158 --> 00:21:01,610
The chicky-boom-chick.

466
00:21:01,610 --> 00:21:02,611
Yeah, man.

467
00:21:02,611 --> 00:21:03,895
It's very nice

468
00:21:03,895 --> 00:21:06,632
So full of spice

469
00:21:06,632 --> 00:21:08,951
I place my hand on your hip

470
00:21:08,951 --> 00:21:12,404
And if you will, just give me your
hand

471
00:21:12,404 --> 00:21:14,006
Then we shall try

472
00:21:14,006 --> 00:21:16,375
Just you and I.

473
00:21:37,396 --> 00:21:38,597
Hey! Hey!

474
00:22:09,061 --> 00:22:09,861
Hey!

475
00:22:27,779 --> 00:22:29,147
Ricky?

476
00:22:29,147 --> 00:22:30,565
Yes, Lucy?

477
00:22:30,565 --> 00:22:33,418
Do I get to be in the show every
night now, Ricky?

478
00:22:33,418 --> 00:22:35,020
Well, I'm afraid not, honey.

479
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:35,821
You were wonderful, but the doctors
say

480
00:22:35,821 --> 00:22:38,223
you got to stay in bed for three
weeks.

481
00:22:38,223 --> 00:22:40,625
You're suffering from malnutrition.

482
00:22:40,625 --> 00:22:42,627
Ew...

Pretty good, eh?

Yes, sir...
isn't that wonderful?

10
00:01:11,404 --> 00:01:13,840
They want us to stay another four
weeks.

11
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,126
If everything goes as well as it did
tonight,

12
00:01:16,126 --> 00:01:18,128
we'll stay there a hundred years.

13
00:01:18,128 --> 00:01:20,413
I took so many bows tonight

14
00:01:20,413 --> 00:01:23,049
that I got a charley horse in my hip.

15
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:26,636
Boy, they sure recognize talent when
they see it.

16
00:02:01,004 --> 00:02:02,005
Good night.

17
00:02:02,005 --> 00:02:03,006
(screams)

18
00:02:06,509 --> 00:02:09,012
Oh...

19
00:02:09,012 --> 00:02:10,830
My goodness, you scared me!

20
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:12,549
When did you sneak in here?

21
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:14,050
A couple of minutes ago.

22
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:17,053
Oh, I must have been so interested in
my book.

23
00:02:17,053 --> 00:02:20,056
Where did my book go?
Where is my book?

24
00:02:20,056 --> 00:02:21,057
It went out the window.

25
00:02:21,057 --> 00:02:23,560
Out the window?

26
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,361
I don't see it anywhere.

27
00:02:25,361 --> 00:02:27,864
Of course not-- it's dark out there.

28
00:02:28,865 --> 00:02:30,366
Good night.

29
00:02:30,366 --> 00:02:31,868
Ricky...

30
00:02:31,868 --> 00:02:32,869
What?

31
00:02:33,369 --> 00:02:36,372
One of us ought to get up and go down
and get it.

32
00:02:36,372 --> 00:02:37,824
One of us?

33
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:38,625
Yes.

34
00:02:39,025 --> 00:02:40,960
Which one of us did you have in mind?

35
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:44,464
Oh, the one that's the biggest and
the strongest.

36
00:02:44,464 --> 00:02:45,465
Okay.

37
00:02:45,465 --> 00:02:46,916
Go ahead.

38
00:02:50,086 --> 00:02:52,105
Oh, Ricky.

39
00:02:52,105 --> 00:02:53,056
Now, look, honey,

40
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:56,059
I'm a husband, not a retriever.

41
00:02:56,059 --> 00:02:57,560
Good night.

42
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:00,780
How can I go to sleep till I know who
killed her?

43
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:03,516
Let's see... it was either the
upstairs maid

44
00:03:03,516 --> 00:03:05,318
or the butler or the cook.

45
00:03:05,318 --> 00:03:07,320
It was her husband.

46
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:09,806
Her husband? He didn't have any
reason to kill her.

47
00:03:09,806 --> 00:03:11,524
He was married, wasn't he?

48
00:03:11,925 --> 00:03:13,743
Oh...

49
00:03:14,244 --> 00:03:16,746
I can see it all now:

50
00:03:16,746 --> 00:03:19,098
He worked very hard all day.

51
00:03:19,098 --> 00:03:21,668
Got home about 2:00 in the morning.

52
00:03:21,668 --> 00:03:23,670
She started pestering him.

53
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:25,505
Wouldn't let him sleep.

54
00:03:25,505 --> 00:03:28,291
He stood it as long as he could.

55
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:31,678
Finally, he decided to do away with
her.

56
00:03:31,678 --> 00:03:33,046
So he got out of bed...

57
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:38,051
...looked around for a murder weapon.

58
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:40,353
A gun!

59
00:03:40,353 --> 00:03:42,355
Nah... make too much noise.

60
00:03:43,856 --> 00:03:45,858
A knife! Aha!

61
00:03:50,363 --> 00:03:51,864
Too sloppy.

62
00:03:53,366 --> 00:03:54,867
Aha!

63
00:03:55,368 --> 00:03:56,653
A scarf.

64
00:03:56,653 --> 00:03:58,154
Perfect.

65
00:04:00,657 --> 00:04:05,161
It would do the job quietly and
neatly.

66
00:04:08,665 --> 00:04:12,669
Slowly he approaches the bed,

67
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:15,171
murder in his heart.

68
00:04:15,171 --> 00:04:16,172
And then...

69
00:04:16,172 --> 00:04:18,491
(snoring loudly)

70
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:24,230
(snoring loudly)

71
00:04:58,514 --> 00:05:00,800
Good morning, Lucy.

72
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,802
I had the most exciting time last
night.

73
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:04,804
I learned how...

74
00:05:04,804 --> 00:05:06,306
What's that you're reading?

75
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:07,307
Lucy...

76
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:09,809
(screams)

77
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:13,313
Gosh, did I scare you?

78
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:16,032
No, no. I was just getting ready to
scream

79
00:05:16,032 --> 00:05:18,735
and throw my book out the window
anyway.

80
00:05:18,735 --> 00:05:19,736
I'm sorry.

81
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:20,737
Gee, no wonder they call it

82
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:22,238
The Mockingbird Murder Mystery.

83
00:05:22,238 --> 00:05:24,240
Every time I get that book in my
hand,

84
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,241
it flies out the window.

85
00:05:25,241 --> 00:05:26,743
Oh, Lucy, forget that book.

86
00:05:26,743 --> 00:05:29,746
I had the most exciting time last
night.

87
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:31,698
I learned how to tell fortunes with
playing cards.

88
00:05:31,698 --> 00:05:33,299
Come on in, I'll tell your fortune.

89
00:05:33,299 --> 00:05:35,501
Look, Ethel, we just rent this
apartment from you.

90
00:05:35,501 --> 00:05:37,103
It doesn't say anything in the lease

91
00:05:37,103 --> 00:05:38,805
about having to have our fortune
told.

92
00:05:38,805 --> 00:05:40,807
Besides, I don't believe in that
silly stuff.

93
00:05:40,807 --> 00:05:42,308
Oh, but this system never fails.

94
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:45,445
It's just fantastic the stuff we
learned last night.

95
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:49,065
Well, maybe the cards will tell you
where my book is.

96
00:05:49,065 --> 00:05:50,566
Now, Lucy, you've got to be serious,

97
00:05:50,566 --> 00:05:52,068
or the cards won't tell you anything.

98
00:05:52,068 --> 00:05:53,569
Oh, I'm so sorry.

99
00:05:53,569 --> 00:05:56,572
Okay... serious.

100
00:06:02,578 --> 00:06:04,080
Now, we have here...

101
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,032
Wait a minute, Ethel, what's wrong
with these cards?

102
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:08,334
Oh, look, let's forget the
fortune-telling.

103
00:06:08,334 --> 00:06:09,836
You're right, there's nothing to it.

104
00:06:09,836 --> 00:06:11,337
Yeah, I know there's nothing to it,

105
00:06:11,337 --> 00:06:13,339
but I want to know what it is there's
nothing to.

106
00:06:13,339 --> 00:06:15,291
Oh, but really, Lucy...

107
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:16,793
Why did you look like you did

108
00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:18,294
when you saw these cards?

109
00:06:18,294 --> 00:06:20,296
No, Lucy, please.

110
00:06:21,297 --> 00:06:22,799
(gasps)

111
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:25,184
Now, what does this grubby little
group of cards

112
00:06:25,184 --> 00:06:27,186
have to say for itself?

113
00:06:27,186 --> 00:06:28,187
Well...

114
00:06:28,187 --> 00:06:29,188
this is your card.

115
00:06:29,188 --> 00:06:31,257
The queen of hearts-- that's you.
Yeah.

116
00:06:31,257 --> 00:06:33,693
And this card right next to it is...

117
00:06:33,693 --> 00:06:35,828
the ace of spades.

118
00:06:35,828 --> 00:06:37,530
What does that mean?

119
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:39,282
Death.

120
00:06:40,283 --> 00:06:41,284
Death!

121
00:06:41,784 --> 00:06:44,737
Well, what's it doing so close to me?

122
00:06:44,737 --> 00:06:46,072
That's just it.

123
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:49,575
When your card is next to the ace of
spades,

124
00:06:49,575 --> 00:06:51,978
that means you're going to be...
dead.

125
00:06:51,978 --> 00:06:53,980
Dead?

126
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:56,499
Like in "as a doornail"?

127
00:06:59,352 --> 00:07:00,336
Oh, what's the matter with me?

128
00:07:00,336 --> 00:07:02,338
I don't believe in fortune-telling.

129
00:07:02,338 --> 00:07:03,840
I don't either.

130
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,842
(laughs giddily)

131
00:07:05,842 --> 00:07:07,343
Well, what are you laughing at?

132
00:07:07,343 --> 00:07:08,845
I'm laughing at fortune-telling

133
00:07:08,845 --> 00:07:10,346
because it's so silly.

134
00:07:10,346 --> 00:07:12,849
(laughs giddily)

135
00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:17,470
(laughs forcedly)

136
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:20,840
Do you know anyone who would like to
kill you?

137
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:21,691
No.

138
00:07:21,691 --> 00:07:22,692
Well, then, you can see...

139
00:07:22,692 --> 00:07:24,610
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

140
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:26,612
Last night I thought Ricky was going
to.

141
00:07:26,612 --> 00:07:27,497
Ricky?!

142
00:07:27,497 --> 00:07:30,450
Yeah... oh, but he was just kidding.

143
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:31,651
I think.

144
00:07:31,651 --> 00:07:33,252
(phone rings)

145
00:07:33,252 --> 00:07:34,120
The phone.

146
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,621
(screams)

147
00:07:35,621 --> 00:07:36,622
Oh...

148
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:38,124
RICKY: Hello?

149
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:39,625
Oh, Ricky got it.

150
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:41,127
I'd better get him some coffee.

151
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:42,395
MAN: Hello, Ricky?

152
00:07:42,395 --> 00:07:44,130
Yeah. Who's this?

153
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:46,048
This is Jerry, your agent, remember?

154
00:07:46,048 --> 00:07:46,866
Oh, yeah.

155
00:07:47,266 --> 00:07:49,268
Yeah, I'm way over in Jersey.

156
00:07:49,268 --> 00:07:51,521
Listen, I signed up that dog act for
you.

157
00:07:51,521 --> 00:07:53,022
They're all set for next week.

158
00:07:53,022 --> 00:07:54,023
Good, good.

159
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,442
Yeah, and now I got to go see a
talking seal.

160
00:07:56,442 --> 00:07:58,978
Talking seal?

161
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:00,646
Does he do an act?

162
00:08:00,646 --> 00:08:02,315
No, no. The seal is the manager.

163
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:04,851
He's got a couple of trained people.

164
00:08:06,919 --> 00:08:08,154
You're daffy.

165
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:10,756
Hey, listen, I want to give you the
dope on the dogs.

166
00:08:10,756 --> 00:08:13,159
You have to get it to the publicity
department

167
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:15,294
this morning, or it'll never get out
on time.

168
00:08:15,294 --> 00:08:16,996
Okay, Jerry, wait a minute, will you?

169
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:17,997
All right.

170
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:19,499
Wait a minute.

171
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:21,501
Give me their names.

172
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:23,503
Oh, here's the dogs' names: Ann...

173
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:24,904
Ann.

174
00:08:24,904 --> 00:08:25,755
Mary...

175
00:08:25,755 --> 00:08:26,589
Mary.

176
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:27,473
Helen...

177
00:08:27,473 --> 00:08:28,457
Helen.

178
00:08:28,457 --> 00:08:29,325
Cynthia...

179
00:08:29,325 --> 00:08:30,176
Cynthia.

180
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:30,977
Alice...

181
00:08:30,977 --> 00:08:32,228
Alice.

182
00:08:32,228 --> 00:08:33,062
...and Theodore.

183
00:08:33,062 --> 00:08:33,946
Theodore.

184
00:08:33,946 --> 00:08:35,147
Yeah.

185
00:08:35,147 --> 00:08:36,782
These are dogs?

186
00:08:36,782 --> 00:08:38,784
Well, that's the way they want to be
billed.

187
00:08:38,784 --> 00:08:41,187
Oh, and listen, while I think of it,
you know,

188
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:43,789
your budget can't afford all those
dogs and a girl singer.

189
00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:45,875
Now, what are you going to do about
Marilyn?

190
00:08:45,875 --> 00:08:47,326
Oh, I didn't tell you, huh?

191
00:08:47,326 --> 00:08:50,329
Well, I've been wondering what to do
about her for a long time.

192
00:08:50,329 --> 00:08:52,331
I finally made up my mind.

193
00:08:52,331 --> 00:08:54,333
I'm going to get rid of her.

194
00:08:56,836 --> 00:08:59,338
Yeah, she's been with me a long time,
Jerry,

195
00:08:59,338 --> 00:09:00,840
and that's the trouble--

196
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:03,092
she's been with me too long.

197
00:09:03,092 --> 00:09:07,213
After all, the same face night after
night

198
00:09:07,713 --> 00:09:09,215
gets pretty tiresome.

199
00:09:09,715 --> 00:09:13,219
I'll... I'll probably miss her some,

200
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:14,220
but in a couple of weeks,

201
00:09:14,654 --> 00:09:15,504
I'll get another one

202
00:09:15,504 --> 00:09:16,439
and she'll be just as good.

203
00:09:16,872 --> 00:09:19,392
Maybe even better.

204
00:09:20,993 --> 00:09:22,595
Yeah, well, I guess you're right.

205
00:09:22,595 --> 00:09:25,398
A girl singer isn't the most
important thing in the world.

206
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:26,599
Oh, before I forget,

207
00:09:26,599 --> 00:09:29,402
did you pick up that trick gadget for
the Western number?

208
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:31,454
The gun? Yeah, I got it right here

209
00:09:31,938 --> 00:09:32,738
in my desk drawer.

210
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:34,140
Oh, that's a good deal.

211
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:36,142
Okay, then, I'll see you later, then.

212
00:09:36,142 --> 00:09:37,493
Good-bye, Jerry.

213
00:09:43,499 --> 00:09:45,001
Oh, hiya, honey.

214
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:46,502
Hi! Hi.

215
00:09:46,502 --> 00:09:49,005
Listen, I have to rush right down to
the club,

216
00:09:49,005 --> 00:09:51,007
so I'll get breakfast down there.

217
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:52,008
Bye.

218
00:09:52,008 --> 00:09:53,009
Good-bye.

219
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:54,510
Oh...

220
00:10:02,368 --> 00:10:04,236
I'll be back in a couple of hours.

221
00:10:04,236 --> 00:10:05,738
Bye.

222
00:10:05,738 --> 00:10:07,740
Uh-oh, I forgot.

223
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,781
(drawer slams)

224
00:10:29,545 --> 00:10:32,031
Ethel! Ethel!

225
00:10:32,031 --> 00:10:33,349
What's the matter?

226
00:10:33,349 --> 00:10:35,351
You're looking at a future doornail.

227
00:10:35,351 --> 00:10:36,852
Huh?

228
00:10:36,852 --> 00:10:38,354
Ricky just tried to kill me.

229
00:10:38,354 --> 00:10:39,705
Really? Then I'm a better

230
00:10:39,705 --> 00:10:41,440
fortune-teller than I thought.

231
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,892
What am I saying?

232
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:44,276
What are you talking about?

233
00:10:44,276 --> 00:10:45,511
I overheard him on the phone.

234
00:10:45,511 --> 00:10:46,812
He's been planning this a long time,

235
00:10:46,812 --> 00:10:48,531
and he finally decided to do it.

236
00:10:48,531 --> 00:10:50,032
Last night was just a dress
rehearsal.

237
00:10:50,032 --> 00:10:51,917
Oh, no, Lucy, you must have
misunderstood him.

238
00:10:51,917 --> 00:10:53,202
No, I didn't.

239
00:10:53,202 --> 00:10:56,155
He took a shot at me already, but he
missed.

240
00:10:56,155 --> 00:10:59,158
Was that the noise I heard just now?

241
00:10:59,158 --> 00:11:01,093
Yeah. he bought a gun especially for
it.

242
00:11:01,093 --> 00:11:02,912
Let's see if it's in that desk.

243
00:11:04,413 --> 00:11:06,415
(gasps)

244
00:11:06,415 --> 00:11:08,918
Oh, you poor, poor thing.

245
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:10,419
What's that?

246
00:11:10,419 --> 00:11:11,420
Ricky wrote something

247
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:12,772
while he was talking on the phone

248
00:11:12,772 --> 00:11:14,106
and he blotted it on this blotter.

249
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:15,474
Where are you going?

250
00:11:15,474 --> 00:11:16,475
Mirror.
Mirror?

251
00:11:16,475 --> 00:11:18,477
Yeah.
Oh, so you can read it.

252
00:11:18,477 --> 00:11:19,895
My, you're clever.

253
00:11:19,895 --> 00:11:21,897
I don't read mystery books for
nothing.

254
00:11:22,398 --> 00:11:24,150
"Helen, Ann, Mary..."

255
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:26,018
(moaning loudly)

256
00:11:26,018 --> 00:11:27,019
What's it mean?

257
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:28,487
I'm not even cold yet,

258
00:11:28,487 --> 00:11:31,273
and Ricky's lining up girls to take
my place.

259
00:11:31,273 --> 00:11:36,612
"Helen, Ann, Mary, Cynthia, Alice,
Theodore."

260
00:11:36,612 --> 00:11:38,114
Theodore?

261
00:12:01,687 --> 00:12:02,688
(gasps)

262
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:05,191
Oh! It's you.

263
00:12:05,191 --> 00:12:06,192
I thought it was Ricky.

264
00:12:06,192 --> 00:12:07,693
Well, what are you going to do?

265
00:12:07,693 --> 00:12:10,196
Just stay here and wait for him to
shoot you?

266
00:12:10,696 --> 00:12:12,198
Oh, I thought maybe I could talk to
him,

267
00:12:12,198 --> 00:12:13,199
make him change his mind.

268
00:12:13,199 --> 00:12:14,200
Are you crazy?

269
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,701
I still love him, Ethel.

270
00:12:15,701 --> 00:12:18,137
Well, all I've got to say is, Lucy,
you're awfully brave.

271
00:12:18,137 --> 00:12:20,372
Oh, I'm not brave at all.
I'm scared to death.

272
00:12:20,372 --> 00:12:21,373
Every time I think about it,

273
00:12:21,807 --> 00:12:23,042
I get a sinking feeling right here.

274
00:12:23,042 --> 00:12:24,043
(clang)

275
00:12:26,629 --> 00:12:28,447
You get a sinking feeling where?

276
00:12:28,848 --> 00:12:29,665
Here.
(clang)

277
00:12:31,517 --> 00:12:32,418
Here?

278
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:33,919
(clang)

279
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,588
What's that?

280
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:37,456
Bulletproof vest.

281
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:44,096
And that's not all I bulletproofed.

282
00:12:49,735 --> 00:12:51,737
That's in case he shoots me in the
back.

283
00:12:51,737 --> 00:12:53,239
I got it all figured out, Ethel.

284
00:12:53,239 --> 00:12:54,640
I'm going to stand right up to him,

285
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,242
and when he comes in that door,

286
00:12:56,242 --> 00:12:58,077
I'm going to say, "Okay, Ricky, okay.

287
00:12:58,077 --> 00:13:00,579
What seems to be the trouble between
us?"

288
00:13:03,582 --> 00:13:06,085
What are you doing?

289
00:13:06,085 --> 00:13:08,754
A moving target is harder to hit.

290
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:12,591
RICKY: Lucy!

291
00:13:12,591 --> 00:13:14,093
It's Ricky!

292
00:13:14,093 --> 00:13:15,094
Where are you, Lucy?

293
00:13:15,594 --> 00:13:16,595
Save me, save me!

294
00:13:16,595 --> 00:13:18,097
Who's going to save me?

295
00:13:18,097 --> 00:13:19,999
He won't shoot you, it's me he's
after.

296
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:22,885
Yes, but to get to you, he's got to
go through me.

297
00:13:22,885 --> 00:13:24,386
Lucy!

298
00:13:24,386 --> 00:13:25,387
Let me go.

299
00:13:25,387 --> 00:13:26,889
Ethel, Ethel, you can't do this to
me.

300
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:27,890
You're my best friend.

301
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:29,642
I know I'm your best friend.

302
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:31,243
That's why I can't stand to see you

303
00:13:31,243 --> 00:13:32,478
riddled with bullets.

304
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:33,479
But Ethel!

305
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:35,481
Ethel! Ethel!

306
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:37,983
Oh, hello, honey, there you are.

307
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:53,499
What's the matter with you, you got
an itch or something?

308
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:56,502
No, nothing's the matter with me.

309
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:58,504
What's new?

310
00:14:08,063 --> 00:14:10,065
What's new?!

311
00:14:10,065 --> 00:14:11,567
I can't go on.

312
00:14:11,567 --> 00:14:12,568
I give up.

313
00:14:13,068 --> 00:14:14,420
Go ahead, shoot.

314
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:15,354
Shoot who?

315
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:16,355
Me.

316
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:17,857
Don't talk silly.

317
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:19,925
Oh, you're getting smart, huh?

318
00:14:19,925 --> 00:14:23,529
Guns make noise, the neighbors might
hear.

319
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:24,947
(screams)

320
00:14:24,947 --> 00:14:27,449
So you're going to strangle me.

321
00:14:27,449 --> 00:14:28,450
I'm not going to shoot you,

322
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:29,952
and I'm not going to strangle you.

323
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:33,539
Fortunately, I'm too big for the
garbage disposal.

324
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:35,875
Lucy, for goodness' sakes...

325
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:37,376
Honey...

326
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:39,378
Lucy, what's the matter with you?

327
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:42,381
Nothing, and there isn't gonna be,
either.

328
00:14:46,385 --> 00:14:47,887
Honey! Lucy!

329
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:48,888
Come out here, honey.

330
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:50,723
Come on, what's the matter with you?

331
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:51,657
Go away!

332
00:14:51,657 --> 00:14:52,942
Open the door, honey!

333
00:14:52,942 --> 00:14:54,944
Come on, honey, open the door!

334
00:14:54,944 --> 00:14:56,445
Go away!

335
00:14:56,445 --> 00:14:57,947
Open the door, honey!

336
00:14:57,947 --> 00:15:00,449
Honey, please, open the door!

337
00:15:00,449 --> 00:15:01,450
Come on, honey,

338
00:15:01,450 --> 00:15:02,952
come on, what's the matter with you?

339
00:15:02,952 --> 00:15:05,070
Hey, Ricky, what's going on up here?

340
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:06,322
Oh, hello, Fred.

341
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:07,823
Ethel came running down to our place

342
00:15:07,823 --> 00:15:09,325
and told me to hurry up here right
away.

343
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:10,242
What's the matter?

344
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:13,078
Don't ask me, Fred-- Lucy's acting
crazy.

345
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:16,815
Crazy for Lucy, or crazy for ordinary
people?

346
00:15:19,218 --> 00:15:20,819
Crazy for anybody.

347
00:15:20,819 --> 00:15:22,471
She seems to have some idea

348
00:15:22,471 --> 00:15:24,473
that I'm going to kill her.

349
00:15:24,473 --> 00:15:25,975
That doesn't mean anything.

350
00:15:25,975 --> 00:15:28,477
Sooner or later every married woman
decides

351
00:15:28,477 --> 00:15:30,479
that her husband wants to kill her.

352
00:15:30,479 --> 00:15:32,481
She's usually right.

353
00:15:34,483 --> 00:15:36,485
Look, Fred, please, this is no time
for jokes.

354
00:15:36,986 --> 00:15:37,987
She's really upset.

355
00:15:37,987 --> 00:15:39,939
I've never seen her like this way
before.

356
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:41,273
Look, I got to go to the club

357
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:42,775
I got a big rehearsal over there.

358
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:44,777
I don't want to leave her alone here
tonight.

359
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:46,028
There's only one thing you can do.

360
00:15:46,028 --> 00:15:48,831
The same thing I do with Ethel when
she gets upset.

361
00:15:48,831 --> 00:15:49,832
What's that?

362
00:15:49,832 --> 00:15:51,333
Slip her a Mickey.

363
00:15:51,333 --> 00:15:52,835
A Mickey?

364
00:15:52,835 --> 00:15:55,337
Well, not really a Mickey...
unfortunately.

365
00:15:55,337 --> 00:15:57,840
Just a mild sedative.

366
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:00,342
Here, I've got one here-- wait.

367
00:16:01,343 --> 00:16:03,345
That's a stomach capsule.

368
00:16:04,847 --> 00:16:05,848
Oh, there's that button

369
00:16:05,848 --> 00:16:08,851
I want sewed back on my pants.

370
00:16:08,851 --> 00:16:12,354
Here... here it is-- here's the
sedative.

371
00:16:12,354 --> 00:16:14,857
Oh, great. If she thinks I'm gonna
kill her,

372
00:16:14,857 --> 00:16:16,859
you don't think she's...
she'll take this, do you?

373
00:16:16,859 --> 00:16:18,861
Just drop that in a glass of soda
water

374
00:16:18,861 --> 00:16:20,362
and she'll never know the difference.

375
00:16:20,362 --> 00:16:22,364
Well, it's not a bad idea, but I
don't know.

376
00:16:22,364 --> 00:16:24,783
Now, that'll put her to sleep for the
rest of the night.

377
00:16:24,783 --> 00:16:26,118
You go on down to the club.

378
00:16:26,118 --> 00:16:27,319
I'll look in from time to time

379
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:28,620
and see that she's all right.

380
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:30,622
Well, thanks, amigo, I hope it works.

381
00:16:30,622 --> 00:16:32,624
Don't you worry about a thing.

382
00:17:16,502 --> 00:17:18,003
Lucy!

383
00:17:22,207 --> 00:17:24,209
Yeah-yeah?

384
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:26,712
Come on, honey, have a drink.

385
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:27,713
Well, I...

386
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:30,215
I'm not really very thirsty.

387
00:17:30,215 --> 00:17:32,718
Oh, come on, sweetheart, it'll do you
good.

388
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:34,720
Come on, honey, come on.

389
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:35,721
Well, all right.

390
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:46,632
Let's dance.

391
00:17:48,233 --> 00:17:49,034
Dance?

392
00:17:49,034 --> 00:17:50,652
Yeah, I haven't danced in a long
time.

393
00:17:50,652 --> 00:17:52,154
Put your glass down here.

394
00:17:52,154 --> 00:17:53,655
But honey, there's no music.

395
00:17:53,655 --> 00:17:56,658
Oh, who needs music?
You dance divinely.

396
00:18:20,682 --> 00:18:23,185
That's enough dancing, let's drink.

397
00:18:23,185 --> 00:18:24,186
(gasps)

398
00:18:24,186 --> 00:18:25,187
Look at that!
What?

399
00:18:25,187 --> 00:18:27,689
That is the biggest spider I've ever
seen.

400
00:18:27,689 --> 00:18:29,191
Where? Where?
I don't see anything.

401
00:18:30,993 --> 00:18:32,995
Well, I gu...
I guess I was mistaken.

402
00:18:32,995 --> 00:18:35,497
Oh. Well, let's drink.

403
00:18:35,497 --> 00:18:36,498
Salud.

404
00:18:36,498 --> 00:18:38,000
Gesundheit.

405
00:18:43,005 --> 00:18:45,007
No, wait!

406
00:18:45,007 --> 00:18:46,508
What was that for?

407
00:18:46,508 --> 00:18:47,726
I can't do it to you

408
00:18:47,726 --> 00:18:49,511
even though you would do it to me.

409
00:18:49,511 --> 00:18:51,013
What are you talking about?

410
00:18:51,013 --> 00:18:53,515
I switched glasses.

411
00:18:53,515 --> 00:18:56,718
I know you did, I switched them back.

412
00:19:00,472 --> 00:19:03,742
You mean... you mean, I got the one
with th-th-the...

413
00:19:03,742 --> 00:19:05,010
You certainly did.

414
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:07,980
(crying hoarsely)

415
00:19:17,489 --> 00:19:20,492
Ricky... Ricky, come here, I want to
talk to you.

416
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:24,863
Ricky, no matter what you've done,

417
00:19:25,264 --> 00:19:26,999
I forgive you.

418
00:19:29,301 --> 00:19:30,903
Thank you.

419
00:19:33,889 --> 00:19:35,390
You're welcome.

420
00:19:41,346 --> 00:19:44,349
Gee, that's a powerful sleeping
powder.

421
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:46,852
Sleeping powder, ha!

422
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:49,721
The sleep from which no one returns.

423
00:19:49,721 --> 00:19:51,657
Oh, honey, come on, you'd better lie
down.

424
00:19:51,657 --> 00:19:52,658
Let me help you lie down.

425
00:19:52,658 --> 00:19:54,660
Lie down, honey, lie down.

426
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:56,161
Don't rush me!

427
00:19:56,161 --> 00:20:00,332
I'll be lying down for a long, long
time.

428
00:20:05,704 --> 00:20:08,006
Boy, that certainly did the trick.

429
00:20:38,654 --> 00:20:39,655
(screams)

430
00:20:39,655 --> 00:20:42,157
(screaming)

431
00:20:42,157 --> 00:20:43,458
Where's Ricky?

432
00:20:43,458 --> 00:20:44,960
He's gone. Are you all right, Lucy?

433
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:48,247
(crying hoarsely)

434
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:49,248
What happened?

435
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:51,450
I got a Mickey from Ricky.

436
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:55,887
This is it, Ethel.

437
00:20:55,887 --> 00:20:58,290
You're just in time to say good-bye.

438
00:20:58,290 --> 00:20:59,491
Good-bye, Lucy.

439
00:20:59,491 --> 00:21:00,692
Good-bye.

440
00:21:02,594 --> 00:21:04,596
How long do you think I've got?

441
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:07,599
Not long.

442
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:08,600
I've got time.

443
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,102
I've got to.

444
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:11,603
What are you going to do?

445
00:21:11,603 --> 00:21:13,105
I'm going down to Ricky's club.

446
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:15,107
If I can't have him, nobody else can.

447
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:16,408
I'll come with you.

448
00:21:16,408 --> 00:21:17,409
Get your coat.

449
00:21:17,409 --> 00:21:18,910
I'm going to rub him out

450
00:21:18,910 --> 00:21:21,913
with the same gun he was going to use
on me.

451
00:21:22,914 --> 00:21:25,867
(laughter and chatter)

452
00:21:25,867 --> 00:21:26,868
All right, Ricky!

453
00:21:26,868 --> 00:21:27,869
(yelling)

454
00:21:27,869 --> 00:21:28,870
Lucy!

455
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:31,373
Lucy, what are you doing?

456
00:21:31,873 --> 00:21:33,875
You know what I'm doing.

457
00:21:34,376 --> 00:21:36,878
Honey, don't make a scene.

458
00:21:36,878 --> 00:21:39,381
Hector, they're wonderful, they're
really great

459
00:21:39,381 --> 00:21:40,882
particularly Mary and Cynthia.

460
00:21:40,882 --> 00:21:42,884
Mary and Cynthia?

461
00:21:42,884 --> 00:21:44,886
Did you write their names down

462
00:21:44,886 --> 00:21:45,887
on the telephone pad?

463
00:21:45,887 --> 00:21:50,892
Yes. That's Ann, Helen, Mary,
Cynthia, Alice

464
00:21:50,892 --> 00:21:52,394
and that's Theodore.

465
00:21:52,394 --> 00:21:54,896
That's Theodore.

466
00:21:55,397 --> 00:21:57,749
Then that really was a sleeping
powder in my drink.

467
00:21:57,749 --> 00:21:58,950
Certainly.

468
00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:00,952
Well, then, what are you doing with
that gun?

469
00:22:00,952 --> 00:22:02,954
I was going to shoot you.

470
00:22:02,954 --> 00:22:03,822
(screams)

471
00:22:05,574 --> 00:22:08,076
Oh, honey.

472
00:22:30,982 --> 00:22:32,818
Hi, honey.

473
00:22:32,818 --> 00:22:35,120
The opening was wonderful!

474
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:37,122
We were sensational.

475
00:22:40,409 --> 00:22:41,410
Good night.

476
00:22:41,410 --> 00:22:42,911
(screams)

477
00:22:43,912 --> 00:22:45,914
I hope this time you can't find it.

("I Love Lucy" theme song playing)

2
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:33,083
Good morning, Lucy.

3
00:00:33,083 --> 00:00:35,585
Fortunately, I'm not the sensitive
type.

4
00:00:35,585 --> 00:00:36,586
Oh, I'm sorry, Ethel.

5
00:00:36,586 --> 00:00:37,587
I'm so terribly busy.

6
00:00:37,587 --> 00:00:39,589
You know what day this is, don't you?

7
00:00:39,589 --> 00:00:41,091
What day is it?

8
00:00:41,091 --> 00:00:44,094
This is the day Ricky goes over my
household accounts.

9
00:00:44,094 --> 00:00:45,095
Well, so long.

10
00:00:45,595 --> 00:00:46,596
Oh, now, Ethel, don't go.

11
00:00:46,596 --> 00:00:48,598
I need your moral support.

12
00:00:48,598 --> 00:00:51,601
I don't think I'll ever get it
figured out.

13
00:01:03,113 --> 00:01:05,115
I know I'm a fool to ask this

14
00:01:05,115 --> 00:01:06,616
but what are you doing?

15
00:01:06,616 --> 00:01:08,118
This is my system for paying bills.

16
00:01:08,118 --> 00:01:10,120
See, I throw them all up in the air,

17
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:12,122
and those that land face up are the
winners.

18
00:01:14,124 --> 00:01:17,127
By the winners, you mean the ones you
pay?

19
00:01:17,127 --> 00:01:18,128
Uh-huh.

20
00:01:18,128 --> 00:01:20,630
Well, what happens if they all land
face up?

21
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:22,132
Well, then I just switch.

22
00:01:22,132 --> 00:01:23,850
I only pay the ones that land
facedown.

23
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:26,252
That figures.

24
00:01:26,252 --> 00:01:27,253
Oh, what's the use?

25
00:01:27,253 --> 00:01:29,756
I can't afford to pay any bills this
month.

26
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:30,757
RICKY: Honey!

27
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:31,758
Yes, dear.

28
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:33,259
Are your books ready for me to see?

29
00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:34,260
Yes.

30
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:35,261
Let me know how you come out.

31
00:01:35,261 --> 00:01:36,262
All right.

32
00:01:38,598 --> 00:01:42,068
Okay, let's see what shape your
accounts are in this month.

33
00:01:42,068 --> 00:01:43,069
I'm afraid...

34
00:01:43,069 --> 00:01:45,522
Well, honey, if you're too busy this
morning...

35
00:01:45,522 --> 00:01:46,523
Oh, no, no, no, no.

36
00:01:46,523 --> 00:01:47,991
I wouldn't miss this

37
00:01:47,991 --> 00:01:49,993
for all the money in the world.

38
00:01:50,493 --> 00:01:52,745
And that's probably what it'll cost
me.

39
00:01:54,747 --> 00:01:56,249
Hmm...

40
00:01:57,750 --> 00:01:58,751
hmm...

41
00:01:58,751 --> 00:02:00,253
Is it interesting?

42
00:02:00,253 --> 00:02:01,187
Very.

43
00:02:02,038 --> 00:02:05,041
50 cents for the newsboy.

44
00:02:05,041 --> 00:02:08,044
39 cents for toothpaste.

45
00:02:08,044 --> 00:02:11,047
15 cents for nail polish.

46
00:02:11,548 --> 00:02:14,267
$245 for miscellaneous.

47
00:02:17,904 --> 00:02:19,639
Miscellaneous?

48
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:21,374
Yeah, miscellaneous.

49
00:02:21,374 --> 00:02:22,725
Would you mind telling me

50
00:02:22,725 --> 00:02:25,228
what comes under miscellaneous?

51
00:02:25,228 --> 00:02:28,448
Oh, you know, rent, groceries,
telephone, electric, gas--

52
00:02:28,448 --> 00:02:29,749
stuff like that.

53
00:02:29,749 --> 00:02:31,451
Oh, that kind of miscellaneous.

54
00:02:31,451 --> 00:02:32,452
Yeah.

55
00:02:32,452 --> 00:02:33,453
Uh-huh.

56
00:02:34,954 --> 00:02:37,757
Well, I'm glad to see you paid this
month's bills.

57
00:02:37,757 --> 00:02:40,410
Well, they're not exactly this
month's bills.

58
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:42,428
Oh? They're last month's?

59
00:02:42,428 --> 00:02:44,631
No, they're not last month's either.

60
00:02:45,131 --> 00:02:47,167
You don't mean they're the month
before last?

61
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:48,918
No, but you're getting warmer.

62
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:54,724
What month's bills are you paying
now?

63
00:02:55,625 --> 00:02:58,444
Jingle bells, jingle bells

64
00:02:58,444 --> 00:03:00,597
Jingle all the way

65
00:03:00,597 --> 00:03:03,183
Oh, what fun it is to ride...

66
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:05,185
Wait, wait, wait.

67
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:09,689
Morbid curiosity makes me want to see
more.

68
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:11,724
The lights have not been paid.

69
00:03:11,724 --> 00:03:13,726
The water hasn't been paid.

70
00:03:13,726 --> 00:03:15,728
The phone hasn't been paid.

71
00:03:15,728 --> 00:03:18,264
Why they haven't been turned off, I
don't know.

72
00:03:18,264 --> 00:03:20,600
Well, I've been going around stalling
our creditors.

73
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:21,417
Huh?

74
00:03:21,417 --> 00:03:23,036
I jollied them out of it.

75
00:03:23,436 --> 00:03:24,370
Oh, you did.

76
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:25,371
Yeah, except that this month

77
00:03:25,371 --> 00:03:28,708
I'm afraid they're going to want more
money and less jolly.

78
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:31,344
Lucy, this is absolutely fantastic.

79
00:03:31,344 --> 00:03:33,346
It's just unbelievable.

80
00:03:33,346 --> 00:03:36,849
I would like a logical explanation of
it.

81
00:03:36,849 --> 00:03:40,987
Well, I'd like a "lowgical
splanation" of it, too.

82
00:03:43,106 --> 00:03:44,357
I make good money.

83
00:03:44,357 --> 00:03:46,859
I bring it home and it disappears.

84
00:03:46,859 --> 00:03:49,362
Now, what have you been doing with
it?

85
00:03:49,362 --> 00:03:53,433
I sank it all in a phony gold mine.

86
00:03:53,833 --> 00:03:55,485
(forced laughter)

87
00:03:55,485 --> 00:03:58,304
(sarcastically imitates laugh)

88
00:03:58,304 --> 00:04:00,039
That's very funny.

89
00:04:00,039 --> 00:04:01,791
I thought you'd like it.

90
00:04:01,791 --> 00:04:03,793
Yeah. Well, I got something very
funny to tell you, too.

91
00:04:03,793 --> 00:04:04,794
Oh, you have?
Yes, I have.

92
00:04:04,794 --> 00:04:07,297
You know, you've used up your
allowance

93
00:04:07,797 --> 00:04:08,798
until next February.

94
00:04:08,798 --> 00:04:10,800
And you're not going to get

95
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,802
any more money until then.

96
00:04:12,802 --> 00:04:14,087
But, Ricky...

97
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:16,856
And not only that, but you can't have
any more charge accounts.

98
00:04:16,856 --> 00:04:18,725
I will handle all the money

99
00:04:18,725 --> 00:04:20,226
and pay all the bills.

100
00:04:20,226 --> 00:04:21,728
Now, isn't that funny?

101
00:04:21,728 --> 00:04:24,731
But, Ricky, you can't do that to me.

102
00:04:24,731 --> 00:04:27,400
Well, now, honey, I know that this
seems very harsh to you right now,

103
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,902
but we got to get our finances in
order

104
00:04:29,902 --> 00:04:31,404
and teach you a lesson

105
00:04:31,404 --> 00:04:33,406
and this is the only way.

106
00:04:33,406 --> 00:04:35,408
But, Ricky, you're so smart.

107
00:04:35,408 --> 00:04:37,910
Can't you think of another way?

108
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:39,912
No!

109
00:04:40,913 --> 00:04:42,415
(wailing)

110
00:04:42,415 --> 00:04:44,417
Look, if you can get the bills paid

111
00:04:44,417 --> 00:04:46,419
we'll go back to the old arrangement.

112
00:04:46,419 --> 00:04:47,920
Until then, it's got to be this way.

113
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,422
Now, come on, come on.

114
00:04:49,422 --> 00:04:49,922
Give me a kiss.

115
00:04:53,426 --> 00:04:55,428
Hmm, salty but nice.

116
00:04:55,428 --> 00:04:56,929
See you later.

117
00:04:59,932 --> 00:05:00,933
How'd it go?

118
00:05:00,933 --> 00:05:01,934
Oh, just awful.

119
00:05:01,934 --> 00:05:03,403
He did something he's never done
before.

120
00:05:03,403 --> 00:05:04,604
What?

121
00:05:04,604 --> 00:05:07,974
He cut off my charge-a-plate.

122
00:05:08,891 --> 00:05:10,243
No!

123
00:05:10,243 --> 00:05:11,944
Yes, and it hurt, too.

124
00:05:11,944 --> 00:05:15,064
Aw, you poor little thing.

125
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:16,566
Hey, I'm on my way to a radio show

126
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:17,066
and I got two tickets.

127
00:05:17,066 --> 00:05:18,067
Why don't you come go with me?

128
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:19,569
It'll take your mind off your
troubles.

129
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:20,570
No.

130
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:23,072
Oh, come on, it's the Freddie Filmore
Show.

131
00:05:23,072 --> 00:05:26,576
You know, the one called Females Are
Fabulous.

132
00:05:26,576 --> 00:05:29,896
I just came from a show called
"Husbands Are Horrible."

133
00:05:29,896 --> 00:05:31,214
Come on, put your coat on.

134
00:05:31,214 --> 00:05:33,716
No, if there's one thing I don't feel
like doing today,

135
00:05:33,716 --> 00:05:34,717
it's going to a radio show.

136
00:05:34,717 --> 00:05:36,719
But you might win a prize.

137
00:05:36,719 --> 00:05:39,222
Well, you go ahead, Ethel.

138
00:05:39,222 --> 00:05:41,224
The first prize is a thousand
dollars.

139
00:05:41,224 --> 00:05:43,226
Well, what would I do with a thousand
dol...

140
00:05:43,226 --> 00:05:45,728
A thousand dollars?!

141
00:05:45,728 --> 00:05:48,731
Uh-huh.
Well, come on, what are we waiting
for?

142
00:05:49,232 --> 00:05:50,233
Well!

143
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:56,522
Females are Fabulous.

144
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:59,025
(applause)

145
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:00,526
Welcome to another session

146
00:06:00,526 --> 00:06:01,928
of Females Are Fabulous,

147
00:06:02,328 --> 00:06:05,531
our very outstanding program based on
the theory

148
00:06:05,531 --> 00:06:07,133
that any woman is willing

149
00:06:07,133 --> 00:06:09,135
to make an idiot out of herself

150
00:06:09,135 --> 00:06:10,787
in order to win a prize.

151
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:12,789
(applause)

152
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:15,908
Now, our first contestant today, a
lovely little lady

153
00:06:15,908 --> 00:06:18,311
who's going to try for our thousand
dollar jackpot,

154
00:06:18,311 --> 00:06:19,712
Mrs. Ricky Ricardo.

155
00:06:19,712 --> 00:06:22,215
Come on out here, Mrs. Ricardo.

156
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:25,718
Oh, we're going to have a lot of fun

157
00:06:25,718 --> 00:06:26,719
aren't we, Mrs. Ricardo?

158
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:28,221
Yeah.

159
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:30,156
Tell me, how would you like to go to
the beach this afternoon?

160
00:06:30,156 --> 00:06:32,225
Oh, I'd like that.
You'd like that.

161
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:33,926
Well, of course, we can't go to the
beach

162
00:06:33,926 --> 00:06:35,528
so we're going to do the next best
thing:

163
00:06:35,528 --> 00:06:37,130
we're going to bring the beach to
you.

164
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:38,481
Bring the beach in here, fellows.

165
00:06:38,481 --> 00:06:39,482
Come on, get it right in here.

166
00:06:39,482 --> 00:06:40,983
That's it, set it right down there.

167
00:06:40,983 --> 00:06:42,485
Oh, isn't that a beautiful beach?

168
00:06:42,485 --> 00:06:43,486
Come on, right onto the beach.

169
00:06:43,486 --> 00:06:44,487
That's it, Mrs. Ricardo.

170
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:45,988
Oh, look at that sand.

171
00:06:45,988 --> 00:06:46,989
Isn't that beautiful?

172
00:06:46,989 --> 00:06:48,491
Hey, why don't you take off your
shoes

173
00:06:48,491 --> 00:06:50,493
so you can wiggle your toes in the
sand?

174
00:06:50,493 --> 00:06:52,995
Don't you always do that when you're
down at the beach?

175
00:06:52,995 --> 00:06:54,497
Yes.
It's a lot of fun, isn't it?

176
00:06:54,497 --> 00:06:56,499
Get it on her, boys, get it on her.

177
00:06:56,499 --> 00:06:57,500
That's it.

178
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,502
Oh, say, isn't that beautiful?

179
00:06:59,502 --> 00:07:00,503
I tell you,

180
00:07:00,503 --> 00:07:02,505
that really does something for you.

181
00:07:02,505 --> 00:07:03,506
Long bathing suit.

182
00:07:03,506 --> 00:07:05,007
(chuckles): Yes, sir.

183
00:07:05,007 --> 00:07:06,008
Oh, and then, too,

184
00:07:06,008 --> 00:07:07,510
we've got a beach umbrella here.

185
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:09,512
You know, we wouldn't want you to get
sunburned.

186
00:07:09,512 --> 00:07:11,514
The sun's awfully bright down here at
the beach

187
00:07:11,514 --> 00:07:13,015
and we do want you to feel...

188
00:07:13,015 --> 00:07:14,016
Oh, that's real fetching, that is.

189
00:07:14,517 --> 00:07:15,017
Yes, sir.

190
00:07:15,518 --> 00:07:17,520
Yes, sir, that really does something
for you.

191
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,988
You all ready for our little game
now?

192
00:07:18,988 --> 00:07:21,240
Well, I'll tell you what we want you
to do.

193
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,158
You know the song

194
00:07:22,158 --> 00:07:23,659
"My Bonnie Lies Over the Ocean"?

195
00:07:23,659 --> 00:07:24,660
Uh, yeah.

196
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:26,662
You do? Lovely little song, isn't it?

197
00:07:26,662 --> 00:07:27,663
Yeah.

198
00:07:27,663 --> 00:07:29,665
Well, what we want you to do is sing
that song,

199
00:07:29,665 --> 00:07:31,167
and every time you mention something

200
00:07:31,167 --> 00:07:32,518
that has to do with water

201
00:07:32,518 --> 00:07:34,454
we're going to do our best to make
you feel

202
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:36,456
that you're right down at the beach.

203
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:36,956
Are you ready?

204
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:37,790
Yeah.

205
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:39,258
Okay, you go ahead.

206
00:07:39,258 --> 00:07:43,713
My... My bonnie lies over the
ocean...

207
00:07:49,218 --> 00:07:52,221
My bonnie lies over the sea...

208
00:08:02,648 --> 00:08:06,252
My bonnie lies over the ocean...

209
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:18,764
Oh, bring back my bonnie to me.

210
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:22,668
Oh, no, now that time, you see, I
didn't squirt you

211
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:24,921
because the last line had nothing to
do with water.

212
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:26,722
Now, do you get the idea of our
little game?

213
00:08:26,722 --> 00:08:28,224
Yes, I see.

214
00:08:28,224 --> 00:08:29,225
Sea!

215
00:08:35,431 --> 00:08:37,083
Listen, I've got a notion...

216
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:38,017
An ocean!

217
00:08:42,271 --> 00:08:44,190
Oh, that was wonderful, Mrs. Ricardo.

218
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:45,575
Yes, sir.

219
00:08:45,575 --> 00:08:47,577
How about giving her a big hand,
folks?

220
00:08:51,581 --> 00:08:56,085
Oh, naughty, naughty, naughty, Mrs.
Ricardo.

221
00:08:56,085 --> 00:08:58,087
Well, where's my thousand dollars?

222
00:08:58,087 --> 00:09:01,591
Oh, no, no, you don't get the
thousand dollars for this.

223
00:09:01,591 --> 00:09:03,092
This was just a little test

224
00:09:03,092 --> 00:09:05,411
to see if you qualify for the
thousand dollars.

225
00:09:05,411 --> 00:09:08,347
And she does qualify, doesn't she,
audience?

226
00:09:09,348 --> 00:09:10,349
Yes, sir.

227
00:09:10,349 --> 00:09:12,351
Now, in just a minute, I'm going to
tell you

228
00:09:12,351 --> 00:09:14,287
the simple little thing you have to
do

229
00:09:14,287 --> 00:09:16,138
in order to actually win the thousand
dollars.

230
00:09:16,138 --> 00:09:18,724
But first we want to present a check
for a thousand dollars

231
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:21,477
to the winner of last week's jackpot,
Mrs. Peterson.

232
00:09:21,477 --> 00:09:24,480
Come right on in here, Mrs. Peterson.

233
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:32,989
Well, now, Mrs. Peterson,

234
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:35,491
it wasn't so tough going over Niagara
Falls

235
00:09:35,491 --> 00:09:36,993
in a barrel, was it?

236
00:09:37,493 --> 00:09:39,495
Well, here's your check.

237
00:09:46,502 --> 00:09:48,504
She seems to be a little shaken up.

238
00:09:48,504 --> 00:09:50,506
Yeah, well, I'll be seeing you.

239
00:09:50,506 --> 00:09:53,509
Oh, no, no, Mrs. Ricardo, now you
stay right here.

240
00:09:53,509 --> 00:09:55,511
This next little stunt is very
simple.

241
00:09:55,511 --> 00:09:56,512
It is?
Oh, yes, yes.

242
00:09:56,512 --> 00:09:58,014
I take it you're married?

243
00:09:58,014 --> 00:09:59,015
Yes.

244
00:09:59,015 --> 00:10:01,017
Never been married before?

245
00:10:01,017 --> 00:10:01,867
No.

246
00:10:01,867 --> 00:10:03,269
You've never been married before.

247
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:04,770
Well, now, I'll tell you what's going
to happen.

248
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:06,572
We're going to send a man out to your
house

249
00:10:06,572 --> 00:10:08,024
and you introduce him to your
husband.

250
00:10:08,024 --> 00:10:09,008
Where's the catch?

251
00:10:09,008 --> 00:10:10,209
Catch?

252
00:10:10,209 --> 00:10:11,410
The gimmick.

253
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:16,032
Oh, I did forget one simple little
thing, yes sirree.

254
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:18,034
You're to introduce this man to your
husband

255
00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:19,535
as your long-lost first husband.

256
00:10:19,535 --> 00:10:21,837
My long-lost first what?

257
00:10:21,837 --> 00:10:23,623
You don't seem to get the picture.

258
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:26,125
Now, look, you're sitting at home at
8:00 tonight,

259
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:28,127
this man comes and knocks on the
door.

260
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:31,130
You open the door, you greet him with
tears in your eyes,

261
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:32,131
you pull him into the room

262
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:34,634
and you introduce him to your present
husband

263
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:35,635
as your first husband

264
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:37,637
whom you thought had disappeared.

265
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:40,339
But what will my husband say?

266
00:10:40,339 --> 00:10:41,190
(chortles gleefully)

267
00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:43,192
That's what we want to know,

268
00:10:43,192 --> 00:10:44,694
isn't it, audience?

269
00:10:44,694 --> 00:10:47,196
(applause)

270
00:10:47,196 --> 00:10:49,198
Yes, sir, now, Mrs. Ricardo

271
00:10:49,198 --> 00:10:51,701
if you can keep up this little
masquerade

272
00:10:52,201 --> 00:10:53,486
until midnight tonight,

273
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:55,988
our man is going to give you this
$1,000.

274
00:10:55,988 --> 00:10:56,989
$1,000?

275
00:10:56,989 --> 00:10:58,491
How about it?

276
00:10:58,491 --> 00:11:01,994
How about letting me go over Niagara
Falls in a paper bag?

277
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:03,996
Ah, no.

278
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:05,998
Now, you have exactly three seconds

279
00:11:05,998 --> 00:11:07,500
to make up your mind.

280
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,001
One... two... three!

281
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:10,002
I'll do it!

282
00:11:10,002 --> 00:11:11,504
I knew you would

283
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:14,006
because I always say "Females Are
Fabulous"!

284
00:11:14,006 --> 00:11:16,008
Give her a big hand, folks!
Come on!

285
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:22,515
Well, that takes care of everything
on today's program

286
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:24,016
except Mrs. Ricky Ricardo.

287
00:11:24,016 --> 00:11:25,518
Here's her address.

288
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:27,019
Now, let me get this straight.

289
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:28,354
I show up there at 8:00 tonight,

290
00:11:28,754 --> 00:11:31,490
And she'll introduce me as her first
husband.

291
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:32,491
That's right.

292
00:11:32,491 --> 00:11:33,993
Now, here's the thousand dollars.

293
00:11:33,993 --> 00:11:35,494
She keeps up the pretense until
midnight

294
00:11:35,494 --> 00:11:36,996
you give her the money.
Got it.

295
00:11:36,996 --> 00:11:38,497
Good luck.

296
00:11:38,497 --> 00:11:39,498
I'll need it.

297
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,502
What a way to make a living.

298
00:11:43,502 --> 00:11:45,004
(sputtering)

299
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:13,399
(banging)

300
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:14,400
I'll get it.

301
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,401
Get what?

302
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:16,902
Somebody knocked.

303
00:12:17,903 --> 00:12:20,906
I was trying to make the lighter
work.

304
00:12:20,906 --> 00:12:21,907
Oh.

305
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:24,910
Why, are you expecting someone?

306
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:25,911
Who, me?

307
00:12:25,911 --> 00:12:27,413
Who would I be expecting

308
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:28,914
at this time of night?

309
00:12:28,914 --> 00:12:30,916
(laughs forcedly)

310
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:35,921
Lucy, you seem awfully nervous
tonight.

311
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:36,922
Me, nervous?

312
00:12:36,922 --> 00:12:39,925
Why, I was never calmer in my life.

313
00:12:57,443 --> 00:12:58,444
Thank you.

314
00:12:58,444 --> 00:13:00,946
Are you sure there's nothing wrong?

315
00:13:00,946 --> 00:13:01,947
No, of course not, dear.

316
00:13:01,947 --> 00:13:02,948
(phone rings)

317
00:13:02,948 --> 00:13:04,450
I'll get it.

318
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:05,951
Hello?

319
00:13:08,954 --> 00:13:11,957
No, I'm sorry, you have the wrong
number.

320
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:15,961
Lucy, I never seen you act so
jittery.

321
00:13:15,961 --> 00:13:17,463
Are you sure everything's all right?

322
00:13:17,963 --> 00:13:18,964
Of course, dear.

323
00:13:18,964 --> 00:13:20,466
Well, why don't you do something?

324
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:21,967
Yeah, I'll do something.

325
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:23,469
You haven't finished those...

326
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:25,971
You haven't finished those socks for
me yet.

327
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:26,972
Oh.

328
00:13:26,972 --> 00:13:27,973
Why don't you knit for a while?

329
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:29,975
Yeah, that's what I wanted to do.

330
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:11,901
Yes?

331
00:14:11,901 --> 00:14:13,903
Madame, can you spare a bit of
sustenance

332
00:14:13,903 --> 00:14:17,106
for a deserving human who has met
with a terrible accident?

333
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:18,107
No!

334
00:14:18,107 --> 00:14:22,745
Any odd jobs for an honest,
able-bodied man?

335
00:14:22,745 --> 00:14:25,197
No, and we don't allow bums in this
building.

336
00:14:25,197 --> 00:14:26,599
Bums!

337
00:14:26,599 --> 00:14:28,417
I think it only fair to warn you,
Madame,

338
00:14:28,417 --> 00:14:30,419
that you are laying yourself open

339
00:14:30,419 --> 00:14:31,921
for a libel suit.

340
00:14:31,921 --> 00:14:35,207
You get out of here, you
good-for-nothing tramp, or I'll call
the police.

341
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:37,710
Aha! I thought you'd change your
tune.

342
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:38,711
Change my tune...

343
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:41,213
Well, it'll do you no good.

344
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:42,715
I'm leaving.

345
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:44,717
Not up there.

346
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:46,685
The street's that way.

347
00:14:50,689 --> 00:14:53,692
What deplorable manners.

348
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:00,933
Lucy.

349
00:15:00,933 --> 00:15:01,901
What?!

350
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:07,072
I just want to know

351
00:15:07,072 --> 00:15:09,575
how you're coming along with my
socks.

352
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:11,076
Oh, just fine, dear.

353
00:15:11,076 --> 00:15:13,078
I'm almost finished, see?

354
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:17,583
I guess I got carried away.

355
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:18,584
(doorbell rings)

356
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:20,085
I'll get it.

357
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:22,588
Ah, good evening.

358
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:23,589
I wonder...

359
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:26,091
Darling, after all these years

360
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:27,593
you've come back.

361
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:28,594
I have?

362
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:31,497
Yes, it's so good to see you.

363
00:15:31,497 --> 00:15:34,900
Well, it's good to see you, too.

364
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:36,902
I, um...

365
00:15:36,902 --> 00:15:38,404
I beg your pardon.

366
00:15:38,904 --> 00:15:39,905
Oh, no, don't go.

367
00:15:39,905 --> 00:15:41,907
I want you to meet Ricky.

368
00:15:41,907 --> 00:15:44,410
Ricky, I don't know exactly how to
say this,

369
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:46,912
but I want you to meet my first
husband.

370
00:15:46,912 --> 00:15:48,414
How do you...

371
00:15:48,414 --> 00:15:50,416
Your first what?

372
00:15:50,416 --> 00:15:51,417
Husband.

373
00:15:51,417 --> 00:15:52,685
Husband?

374
00:15:52,685 --> 00:15:53,669
What kind of...

375
00:15:53,669 --> 00:15:54,670
Now, Ricky, Ricky, don't get excited.

376
00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:55,671
Let's all sit down

377
00:15:55,671 --> 00:15:57,589
and talk about this calmly.

378
00:15:57,589 --> 00:16:00,592
Yes, let's all sit down.

379
00:16:03,595 --> 00:16:05,597
Sit down, Ricky.

380
00:16:07,599 --> 00:16:09,601
I don't feel like sitting down.

381
00:16:09,601 --> 00:16:10,602
Now, listen, you,

382
00:16:10,602 --> 00:16:12,604
what kind of a gag is this?

383
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:17,476
Well, it's really nothing, dear.

384
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:18,477
Nothing?

385
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:20,446
Well, it's just that a long time
ago--

386
00:16:20,446 --> 00:16:22,564
before I met you-- I was friends
with...

387
00:16:22,564 --> 00:16:24,566
You were not friends.
You were married.

388
00:16:25,868 --> 00:16:27,369
Yeah, just a little bit.

389
00:16:29,221 --> 00:16:30,122
A little bit?

390
00:16:30,589 --> 00:16:32,908
Well, all right, I was married to...

391
00:16:32,908 --> 00:16:33,909
Harold.
Sam.

392
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:36,912
Sam.
Harold.

393
00:16:36,912 --> 00:16:39,415
All right, all right, so you were
married

394
00:16:39,415 --> 00:16:42,418
to Harold, Sam, Julius or whichever
his name is.

395
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:43,919
Julius!?

396
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:46,388
You stay out of this.

397
00:16:46,388 --> 00:16:47,890
How long were you married?

398
00:16:47,890 --> 00:16:50,392
Well, it was just a matter of weeks.

399
00:16:50,392 --> 00:16:53,395
Really, it's not worth talking about,
Ricky.

400
00:16:53,395 --> 00:16:55,848
Not worth talking about?

401
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:57,850
Ha!

402
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:02,354
Well, we were married for a very
short time

403
00:17:02,354 --> 00:17:04,857
and then Harold had to join the
service

404
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:07,910
and then I learned he was missing in
action.

405
00:17:07,910 --> 00:17:11,413
Aw... oh, oh!

406
00:17:11,413 --> 00:17:14,416
It was for the battle of the Argonne
Woods.

407
00:17:14,917 --> 00:17:17,419
The Kaiser's troops were all about
us,

408
00:17:17,419 --> 00:17:21,673
and Blackjack Sherman Pershing put
his hand on my shoulder

409
00:17:21,673 --> 00:17:23,108
and said to me, "Sam"--

410
00:17:23,108 --> 00:17:25,461
he always called me by my nickname--

411
00:17:25,461 --> 00:17:28,464
"Sam," he said, "gather about you..."

412
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:29,465
Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a
minute.

413
00:17:29,465 --> 00:17:31,467
Look, the battle of the Argonne Woods

414
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:33,185
was in the first world war.

415
00:17:33,185 --> 00:17:34,386
Yes...

416
00:17:34,386 --> 00:17:36,355
That was 33 years ago.

417
00:17:36,355 --> 00:17:38,557
Ewww...

418
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:45,564
How old were you when you got
married?

419
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:47,533
I-I was very young.

420
00:17:47,533 --> 00:17:50,135
Yeah. As a matter of fact, how old
are you now?

421
00:17:51,453 --> 00:17:53,455
65.

422
00:17:53,455 --> 00:17:55,240
What do you think, I'm a dope or
something?

423
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,742
You couldn't possibly be 65.

424
00:17:57,242 --> 00:17:57,743
I couldn't?

425
00:17:58,243 --> 00:18:00,746
Of course not, look at you.

426
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:02,748
55 yes, but not 65.

427
00:18:05,717 --> 00:18:07,719
Don't you care what he says, dollface

428
00:18:07,719 --> 00:18:09,721
you still look good to me.

429
00:18:09,721 --> 00:18:10,722
A tu te calla la boca

430
00:18:10,722 --> 00:18:13,225
y no le digas a mi señora
"dollface".

431
00:18:13,225 --> 00:18:15,727
LUCY: Ricky, Ricky, now don't get
excited.

432
00:18:15,727 --> 00:18:17,729
I was married to Harold, and that's
all there is to it.

433
00:18:17,729 --> 00:18:20,232
Well, that's true-- I know it must
come

434
00:18:20,232 --> 00:18:23,235
as a horrible and surprising
disclosure...

435
00:18:23,235 --> 00:18:24,736
but the children are entitled

436
00:18:24,736 --> 00:18:26,238
to their true father.

437
00:18:26,238 --> 00:18:27,739
The children?

438
00:18:27,739 --> 00:18:30,742
Yes, my little darlings.

439
00:18:30,742 --> 00:18:31,743
Where are they?

440
00:18:31,743 --> 00:18:35,047
Don't you have them?

441
00:18:36,331 --> 00:18:40,536
You've misplaced them again.

442
00:18:40,536 --> 00:18:43,038
You always were forgetful,

443
00:18:43,038 --> 00:18:44,540
weren't you, uh, uh...?

444
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:47,042
What's her name?

445
00:18:47,543 --> 00:18:49,044
Well, I always called her Red.

446
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:50,429
Now, Ricky.

447
00:18:50,429 --> 00:18:51,797
You stay out of this.

448
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:52,664
What's her name?

449
00:18:52,664 --> 00:18:53,465
Ricky.

450
00:18:53,465 --> 00:18:54,967
Lucy, I told you...

451
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:55,968
Ah...

452
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:57,970
the forgetful little Lucy.

453
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:03,475
How well I remember the first time I
heard that lilting name.

454
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:05,477
It seems like yesterday.

455
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:08,197
In fact, it seems like today.

456
00:19:09,698 --> 00:19:11,200
Now, look, am I going crazy or
something?

457
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,202
Neither one of you is telling the
truth.

458
00:19:13,202 --> 00:19:14,703
Now, why would you want me to think

459
00:19:14,703 --> 00:19:16,705
that she's married to you in the
first place?

460
00:19:16,705 --> 00:19:18,207
Well, uh...

461
00:19:21,877 --> 00:19:23,378
Lucy, I want the truth.

462
00:19:23,378 --> 00:19:24,379
The truth?

463
00:19:24,379 --> 00:19:28,800
Yes, were you or were you not married
to... him?

464
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,269
Yes.

465
00:19:30,269 --> 00:19:31,470
Well, that does it, I'm packing.

466
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:32,387
Packing?

467
00:19:32,387 --> 00:19:33,889
Of course.
If we are not married,

468
00:19:33,889 --> 00:19:35,891
you can't expect me to stay here.

469
00:19:35,891 --> 00:19:39,411
Besides, you want to be alone with
your husband.

470
00:19:39,411 --> 00:19:40,679
But, Ricky...

471
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:41,680
ETHEL: Psst!

472
00:19:44,933 --> 00:19:46,935
Did that man from the program get
here?

473
00:19:46,935 --> 00:19:47,936
Yeah, he's here.

474
00:19:49,938 --> 00:19:51,440
I don't want to take up any of your
time.

475
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,442
I just wanted to find how you were
making out.

476
00:19:53,442 --> 00:19:54,943
Okay.
Can I take a peek at him?

477
00:19:54,943 --> 00:19:55,944
Yeah, go ahead.

478
00:19:57,446 --> 00:19:58,447
(gasps)

479
00:19:58,447 --> 00:20:00,449
What's that bum doing in there?

480
00:20:00,949 --> 00:20:01,950
What bum?

481
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:03,635
That tramp-- he was down at my door

482
00:20:03,635 --> 00:20:06,038
not ten minutes ago asking for a
handout.

483
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:07,506
He's not the man from the program.

484
00:20:08,006 --> 00:20:08,507
Oh!

485
00:20:09,007 --> 00:20:11,009
Take your hand out of that drawer.

486
00:20:11,009 --> 00:20:12,511
The honeymoon is over.

487
00:20:12,511 --> 00:20:14,012
What do you mean going on up those
stairs

488
00:20:14,012 --> 00:20:16,014
when I told you the street was the
other way?

489
00:20:16,014 --> 00:20:18,016
Good-bye, Lucy.

490
00:20:19,017 --> 00:20:21,019
Good-bye, Ricky.

491
00:20:21,019 --> 00:20:23,021
Wait a minute, come back here.

492
00:20:23,021 --> 00:20:26,024
Now, now, now, I resent this
intrusion upon my person.

493
00:20:26,024 --> 00:20:29,528
Those are my life's savings you're
taking from me.

494
00:20:38,537 --> 00:20:40,038
On your way.

495
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:45,043
There is no need seeing me to the
door.

496
00:20:47,546 --> 00:20:50,749
Mother told me to expect days like
this.

497
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:52,751
Get out!

498
00:20:53,752 --> 00:20:55,621
The nerve of some bums.

499
00:20:57,422 --> 00:21:00,926
Now, Mrs. Ricardo, if you don't mind,

500
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:02,928
I think that I am entitled

501
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:05,931
to a little bit of an explanation

502
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:08,433
of what is going on here!

503
00:21:08,433 --> 00:21:09,434
Oh!

504
00:21:09,434 --> 00:21:10,936
Uh... Oh, Ethel, would you excuse us?

505
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:12,938
I have a little explaining to do to
Ricky.

506
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:15,440
You sure have, dear.
Good night.

507
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:18,944
Now, now, Ricky, sit down, dear.

508
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:19,945
Sit down.

509
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:22,447
Wait till you hear.

510
00:21:22,447 --> 00:21:25,951
It's so funny and it's so simple.

511
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:26,952
Well, what is it?

512
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:28,453
Well, you know this morning

513
00:21:28,453 --> 00:21:30,222
when we had that discussion about
money.

514
00:21:30,222 --> 00:21:31,173
Well, Ethel and I...

515
00:21:31,173 --> 00:21:32,174
(doorbell rings)

516
00:21:32,174 --> 00:21:33,175
Oh, I'll get it.

517
00:21:33,175 --> 00:21:34,676
No, no-- I'll get it.

518
00:21:39,181 --> 00:21:41,183
Is this the Ricardo residence?

519
00:21:41,183 --> 00:21:42,684
Yes.

520
00:21:42,684 --> 00:21:46,638
Darling, don't you recognize me?

521
00:21:46,638 --> 00:21:48,140
It's Arnold.

522
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:50,142
Well?

523
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:53,745
Ricky, I want you to meet my second
first husband.

524
00:21:59,484 --> 00:22:00,285
Now, Ricky, listen to me.

525
00:22:00,285 --> 00:22:01,219
Please listen to me.

526
00:22:01,219 --> 00:22:03,689
That's what they asked me to do at
the radio program

527
00:22:03,689 --> 00:22:05,190
in order to win that thousand
dollars,

528
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:06,692
and I came home and I tried to do it,

529
00:22:06,692 --> 00:22:08,527
and I don't know who that first man
was

530
00:22:08,527 --> 00:22:09,728
but I was never married to him

531
00:22:09,728 --> 00:22:11,530
and this is the man from the program

532
00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:12,531
and he's my real first husband

533
00:22:12,981 --> 00:22:14,299
but I was never married to him either

534
00:22:14,299 --> 00:22:15,617
and that's the truth, so help me.

535
00:22:15,617 --> 00:22:17,502
Now, if you don't believe me, you can
leave.

536
00:22:17,502 --> 00:22:19,404
That is the most ridiculous story

537
00:22:19,404 --> 00:22:20,405
I've ever heard in my whole life.

538
00:22:20,906 --> 00:22:21,907
But it's true, Mr. Ricardo,

539
00:22:21,907 --> 00:22:24,743
and your wife didn't start explaining
until after midnight,

540
00:22:24,743 --> 00:22:26,445
so she wins the thousand dollars.

541
00:22:26,445 --> 00:22:27,796
Congratulations, Mrs. Ricardo,

542
00:22:27,796 --> 00:22:30,082
and thanks for a very pleasant
evening.

543
00:22:30,082 --> 00:22:31,083
Thank you.

544
00:22:31,083 --> 00:22:32,084
Good night.

545
00:22:32,084 --> 00:22:33,585
Good night.

546
00:22:35,087 --> 00:22:37,089
You give me that, Ricky Ricardo.

547
00:22:37,089 --> 00:22:38,590
That belongs to me.

548
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:39,591
Let's see.

549
00:22:40,592 --> 00:22:42,594
Rent, $250...

550
00:22:42,594 --> 00:22:44,596
grocer, $100...

551
00:22:44,596 --> 00:22:47,099
charge account, $575...

552
00:22:47,099 --> 00:22:48,934
utilities, $74.50.

553
00:22:48,934 --> 00:22:52,237
Well, you got some change coming.

554
00:22:52,237 --> 00:22:53,739
Well, I should hope so.

555
00:22:54,239 --> 00:22:55,240
There you are.

556
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:57,242
Ricky!

(I Love Lucy theme music plays)

2
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:37,203
Ricky, time to get up!

3
00:00:37,203 --> 00:00:39,706
Ricky, time to get up.

4
00:00:39,706 --> 00:00:41,207
Aw, come on, now, honey.

5
00:00:41,207 --> 00:00:43,209
You said you had an appointment at
11:00

6
00:00:43,209 --> 00:00:44,711
and it's after 10:00.

7
00:00:44,711 --> 00:00:45,712
(groans)

8
00:00:46,212 --> 00:00:48,715
All right, you asked for it.

9
00:00:55,722 --> 00:00:57,724
iBabalu!

10
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:59,225
iBabalu!

11
00:00:59,225 --> 00:01:02,228
iBabalu-aye!

12
00:01:02,228 --> 00:01:04,230
All right, all right, all right, all
right!

13
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:06,232
All right, I'll get up.

14
00:01:06,232 --> 00:01:07,233
All right.

15
00:01:10,737 --> 00:01:12,238
Ricky!

16
00:01:12,238 --> 00:01:14,240
Ricky!

17
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,742
Yeah?

18
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:19,746
Did you find out when you're going to
do your TV audition?

19
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:20,747
No, I didn't.

20
00:01:20,747 --> 00:01:21,748
You did, too.

21
00:01:21,748 --> 00:01:23,249
I did not.

22
00:01:23,249 --> 00:01:24,250
It's any day now.

23
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:28,254
They're going to tell me whenever
they're ready.

24
00:01:28,254 --> 00:01:30,256
You know, I've been thinking

25
00:01:30,256 --> 00:01:32,258
about shows like Burns and Allen.

26
00:01:32,258 --> 00:01:34,544
George Burns uses his wife on the
show.

27
00:01:34,544 --> 00:01:35,528
Why don't you?

28
00:01:35,528 --> 00:01:37,130
I'd love to.

29
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:39,265
You think she would leave George?

30
00:01:39,265 --> 00:01:40,767
Oh...

31
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:42,268
Well, I know one thing--

32
00:01:42,268 --> 00:01:44,771
you'll never be a success on
television.

33
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:46,773
And what do you mean by that, pray
tell?

34
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:51,277
Because you don't have a pretty girl
in your act, that's why.

35
00:01:51,277 --> 00:01:54,180
(under his breath): Here we go again.

36
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:55,415
I'll get along.

37
00:01:57,433 --> 00:01:59,385
Everybody knows that you have to have

38
00:01:59,385 --> 00:02:01,888
a pretty girl in your act to
demonstrate

39
00:02:01,888 --> 00:02:02,889
the sponsor's product.

40
00:02:02,889 --> 00:02:04,891
Really?
Sure. She eats it or drinks it

41
00:02:04,891 --> 00:02:07,894
or waxes the floor with it or cuts
potatoes with it

42
00:02:07,894 --> 00:02:09,395
or drives off in it.

43
00:02:09,395 --> 00:02:10,897
Or smokes it.

44
00:02:15,902 --> 00:02:16,402
So?

45
00:02:16,402 --> 00:02:18,404
So how would you like to have

46
00:02:18,404 --> 00:02:20,406
your sponsor's product demonstrated

47
00:02:20,406 --> 00:02:21,908
by a gorgeous redhead?

48
00:02:21,908 --> 00:02:23,209
I'd love it.

49
00:02:23,209 --> 00:02:24,511
Oh, you would?

50
00:02:24,511 --> 00:02:26,179
You know where I can find one?

51
00:02:26,179 --> 00:02:27,096
Oh!

52
00:02:27,096 --> 00:02:28,898
Ay-ay-ay!

53
00:02:29,399 --> 00:02:30,900
(shouting in Spanish)

54
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,402
Now what are you doing?

55
00:02:32,402 --> 00:02:33,903
I'm looking for my ear.

56
00:02:33,903 --> 00:02:35,905
Oh...

57
00:02:35,905 --> 00:02:37,907
You didn't really lose an ear.

58
00:02:37,907 --> 00:02:39,409
Eh? How's that?

59
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:40,410
Oh, stop it.

60
00:02:42,412 --> 00:02:44,414
Honey, you know how I feel about
this.

61
00:02:44,414 --> 00:02:46,416
I don't want my wife in show
business.

62
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:47,417
Why not?

63
00:02:47,417 --> 00:02:49,419
Oh, Lucy, we've been over this

64
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:50,920
10,000 times.

65
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,922
I want a wife who's just a wife.

66
00:02:52,922 --> 00:02:55,925
Now, all you have to do is clean the
house for me,

67
00:02:55,925 --> 00:02:58,428
bring me my slippers when I come home
at night,

68
00:02:58,428 --> 00:03:01,431
cook for me and be the mama for my
children.

69
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:03,433
You never wear your slippers.

70
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:04,434
It doesn't matter.

71
00:03:04,434 --> 00:03:05,935
Just do the others.

72
00:03:07,937 --> 00:03:10,440
You're missing a good bet.

73
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,941
Huh?

74
00:03:11,941 --> 00:03:14,944
I say, you're missing a good bet.

75
00:03:15,445 --> 00:03:17,447
Am I?

76
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:19,449
Yeah.

77
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:21,451
How you figure?

78
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:23,453
Because I can sing.

79
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:26,956
Oh?

80
00:03:26,956 --> 00:03:28,458
And dance.

81
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:29,959
What else?

82
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:30,960
And tell jokes.

83
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:31,961
How about it?

84
00:03:31,961 --> 00:03:32,962
No.

85
00:03:32,962 --> 00:03:33,963
No?

86
00:03:33,963 --> 00:03:34,964
No.

87
00:03:34,964 --> 00:03:36,466
Oh, you have no imagination.

88
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:38,968
I'll bet if Ziegfeld or Earl Carroll
had seen me,

89
00:03:38,968 --> 00:03:40,470
they'd sign me up like that.

90
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:41,471
As what?

91
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:43,473
As a beautiful show girl.

92
00:03:43,473 --> 00:03:44,974
(doorbell rings)

93
00:03:44,974 --> 00:03:46,976
Go answer the door.

94
00:03:46,976 --> 00:03:48,478
Oh!

95
00:03:49,979 --> 00:03:51,981
(whistling)

96
00:03:55,485 --> 00:03:56,486
Oh.

97
00:04:05,578 --> 00:04:07,580
Hey, Rick, have I got news for you!

98
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:08,581
Tonight's the night.

99
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:10,083
Your audition's tonight.

100
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:12,585
Shh! I don't want Lucy to hear.

101
00:04:12,585 --> 00:04:15,088
Oh. Oh, well, the network big shots
are coming down

102
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:17,590
to the club tonight to audition your
show for TV.

103
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:18,591
How do you know?

104
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:20,593
Well, read this telegram.

105
00:04:20,593 --> 00:04:22,095
I opened it by mistake.

106
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:24,597
Oh, here's some mail for you.

107
00:04:24,597 --> 00:04:27,600
"Dear Mr. Ricardo, we're coming down
to the Tropicana

108
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,502
to catch your show tonight."

109
00:04:29,502 --> 00:04:31,387
Oh, Fred, that's wonderful!

110
00:04:31,387 --> 00:04:34,891
For goodness' sakes, don't tell Lucy,
will you?

111
00:04:34,891 --> 00:04:36,392
If she knows the audition is tonight

112
00:04:36,392 --> 00:04:37,894
she'll be pestering the life out of
me

113
00:04:37,894 --> 00:04:39,395
trying to get into the act.

114
00:04:39,395 --> 00:04:41,397
How am I going to get rid of her for
the day?

115
00:04:41,397 --> 00:04:43,900
Well, you could lock her in the
bathroom.

116
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:45,902
If she stays in there as long as
Ethel does

117
00:04:45,902 --> 00:04:48,404
she'd never even know the door's
locked.

118
00:04:48,404 --> 00:04:50,406
No, Fred, I can't do that.

119
00:04:50,406 --> 00:04:52,408
Let's see what we got in here.

120
00:04:52,408 --> 00:04:53,409
Boy, what is this?

121
00:04:53,409 --> 00:04:54,911
What is all that stuff?

122
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:55,912
Oh, it's our wills.

123
00:04:56,412 --> 00:04:58,414
The attorney wants us to sign them.

124
00:04:58,414 --> 00:05:00,416
Wills? Oh, that's a happy thought.

125
00:05:00,416 --> 00:05:02,919
Listen, if my show is not a success
tonight,

126
00:05:02,919 --> 00:05:04,420
I'm going to need them.

127
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:05,922
Well, I wish I could help you.

128
00:05:05,922 --> 00:05:06,923
I wish you could figure

129
00:05:07,423 --> 00:05:08,424
a way to get rid of Lucy.

130
00:05:08,424 --> 00:05:09,425
Yeah?
Hey, I know.

131
00:05:09,425 --> 00:05:12,428
I'll have her take these things down
to the attorney.

132
00:05:12,428 --> 00:05:14,430
His office is way downtown.

133
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:15,431
Well, that ought to do it.

134
00:05:15,431 --> 00:05:16,432
Now-Now-Now, listen,

135
00:05:16,432 --> 00:05:17,934
can I come and hear the rehearsal
tonight?

136
00:05:17,934 --> 00:05:18,935
Sure.

137
00:05:18,935 --> 00:05:20,937
Remember now-- tonight's the night.
Knock 'em dead!

138
00:05:20,937 --> 00:05:21,938
Shh!

139
00:05:21,938 --> 00:05:22,939
Shh!

140
00:05:22,939 --> 00:05:24,440
(mouthing words)

141
00:05:29,946 --> 00:05:35,451
(humming "A Pretty Girl Is Like a
Melody")

142
00:05:35,952 --> 00:05:40,456
Da, da, da, da, da, da

143
00:05:40,456 --> 00:05:43,960
Da-da, da-da-da-da

144
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:46,462
Da-da-da-da...

145
00:05:46,462 --> 00:05:47,463
(drum beat)

146
00:05:50,967 --> 00:05:51,968
Lucy...

147
00:05:51,968 --> 00:05:52,969
Yes?

148
00:05:52,969 --> 00:05:53,970
No.

149
00:05:53,970 --> 00:05:55,471
Oh, Ricky!

150
00:05:55,471 --> 00:05:56,973
Don't you want to know

151
00:05:56,973 --> 00:05:58,474
who was at the door?

152
00:05:58,474 --> 00:05:59,976
Who was it? Your agent?

153
00:05:59,976 --> 00:06:02,478
Does he know when the TV audition is?

154
00:06:02,478 --> 00:06:03,479
What'd he say?
What'd he say?

155
00:06:03,479 --> 00:06:06,482
No, it wasn't my agent; it was the
mailman.

156
00:06:06,482 --> 00:06:07,984
Oh.
He brought some papers for us to sign

157
00:06:07,984 --> 00:06:09,986
and we got to take them down to the
attorney's.

158
00:06:09,986 --> 00:06:10,987
It's my will.

159
00:06:10,987 --> 00:06:13,489
Well, I'll get your breakfast.

160
00:06:13,489 --> 00:06:14,490
Your will?!

161
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:15,491
Yes.

162
00:06:15,491 --> 00:06:16,993
What's the matter, Ricky?

163
00:06:16,993 --> 00:06:18,494
Nothing is the matter.

164
00:06:18,494 --> 00:06:19,495
There is, too.

165
00:06:19,495 --> 00:06:21,497
You're keeping something from me.

166
00:06:21,497 --> 00:06:22,999
You're sick!

167
00:06:22,999 --> 00:06:25,001
I never felt better in my whole life.

168
00:06:25,001 --> 00:06:27,503
Then you lied to me when we were
married.

169
00:06:28,004 --> 00:06:30,006
You're really older than I think.

170
00:06:30,006 --> 00:06:32,508
Now, look, honey, it's just good
business.

171
00:06:32,508 --> 00:06:34,510
The lawyer says I should have a will.

172
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:36,496
Then everything is legally taken care
of

173
00:06:36,496 --> 00:06:38,314
if anything happens.

174
00:06:38,314 --> 00:06:39,816
I won't discuss it.

175
00:06:39,816 --> 00:06:41,317
Oh, look, honey,

176
00:06:41,317 --> 00:06:44,320
you have to know how things are
arranged

177
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:47,323
so you know what to do when I, uh...

178
00:06:47,323 --> 00:06:48,825
when I go.

179
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:50,827
Oh, all right, Ricky.

180
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:51,828
That's better.

181
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:56,833
(wailing)

182
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:58,334
Now what's the matter?

183
00:06:58,334 --> 00:07:01,587
Oh, Ricky, I miss you so.

184
00:07:01,587 --> 00:07:04,090
For goodness' sakes, Lucy

185
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:06,092
I haven't gone yet.

186
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:08,594
Don't go, Ricky, don't go.

187
00:07:08,594 --> 00:07:10,596
Now, look, honey, I'm perfectly well.

188
00:07:10,596 --> 00:07:11,597
I feel fine.

189
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:13,099
But let's face it.

190
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:14,600
We all have to go sometime.

191
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,385
We do?

192
00:07:16,385 --> 00:07:20,389
We do, unless you know something the
rest of us don't.

193
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:23,893
No, I "dunt."

194
00:07:27,697 --> 00:07:29,699
I'll get your breakfast.

195
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:31,200
All right, honey.

196
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,202
He brought your will along, too.

197
00:07:35,204 --> 00:07:36,205
My will?

198
00:07:36,205 --> 00:07:37,206
Yeah.

199
00:07:37,206 --> 00:07:38,491
What for?

200
00:07:38,491 --> 00:07:40,493
You're the one that's going.

201
00:07:42,495 --> 00:07:43,729
Now, Lucy...

202
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:45,548
What are you trying to do--

203
00:07:45,548 --> 00:07:47,550
shove me ahead of you in line?

204
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:48,534
Now, look, honey,

205
00:07:48,534 --> 00:07:50,236
this isn't my idea-- it's lawyer's.

206
00:07:50,236 --> 00:07:53,055
We got to get them signed, and you
got to take them

207
00:07:53,556 --> 00:07:55,057
down to the attorney's today.

208
00:07:55,057 --> 00:07:56,058
Impossible.

209
00:07:56,058 --> 00:07:57,560
I have an appointment

210
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,846
to have my hair dyed-- washed.

211
00:07:59,846 --> 00:08:01,347
They got to go today.

212
00:08:01,347 --> 00:08:02,348
Now, come on.

213
00:08:02,348 --> 00:08:04,851
Oh, Ricky, the attorney's way
downtown.

214
00:08:04,851 --> 00:08:06,352
It'll take me all day.

215
00:08:06,352 --> 00:08:07,353
Yeah, I know.

216
00:08:07,353 --> 00:08:09,355
Oh, can't they wait?

217
00:08:09,355 --> 00:08:10,857
Absolutely not.

218
00:08:10,857 --> 00:08:11,858
Well, why not?

219
00:08:11,858 --> 00:08:14,360
Well... Well, suppose you didn't take
them down

220
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,361
till tomorrow.

221
00:08:15,361 --> 00:08:16,362
Yes?

222
00:08:16,362 --> 00:08:18,364
And we both got killed today.

223
00:08:18,364 --> 00:08:19,365
Yes?

224
00:08:19,365 --> 00:08:21,868
How could you take them down
tomorrow?

225
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:27,206
Oh, yeah, that's right.

226
00:08:27,206 --> 00:08:29,375
RICKY: Ole, ole, ole, ole...

227
00:08:29,375 --> 00:08:31,377
BAND: Ole, ole, ole, ole...

228
00:08:31,878 --> 00:08:33,379
Ah, ah, ah, ah...

229
00:08:33,379 --> 00:08:35,381
Ah, ah, ah, ah...

230
00:08:35,381 --> 00:08:36,883
All right, all right, fellows.

231
00:08:36,883 --> 00:08:38,384
That's pretty bad, you know.

232
00:08:38,384 --> 00:08:39,886
If you're going to sing, don't go:

233
00:08:39,886 --> 00:08:41,387
Ah, ah, ah, ah.

234
00:08:41,387 --> 00:08:43,389
Let's go: Ah, ah, ah, ah!

235
00:08:43,389 --> 00:08:44,891
Let's put some pep into the thing.

236
00:08:44,891 --> 00:08:46,826
What's the use of having a rehearsal

237
00:08:46,826 --> 00:08:48,694
if we're not going to do it right?

238
00:08:48,694 --> 00:08:50,196
Buffo, aren't you ready yet?

239
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:51,197
MAN: I'm ready.

240
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:52,698
Go ahead with my music.

241
00:08:52,698 --> 00:08:56,202
All right, give me the clown music,
fellows.

242
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:58,204
(playing circus march)

243
00:09:00,706 --> 00:09:02,208
All right, wait, wait, wait a minute.

244
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:04,210
Listen, aren't you going to do

245
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:05,711
the cello bit first?

246
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:07,914
No, I'm going to do the handstand

247
00:09:07,914 --> 00:09:09,215
on the handlebars.

248
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:10,216
Oh, okay.

249
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:12,718
(music resumes)

250
00:09:20,726 --> 00:09:23,229
Buffo!

251
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:25,231
What happened there?

252
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:26,232
Hey, buffo!

253
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:27,733
What happened, kid?

254
00:09:27,733 --> 00:09:28,734
The brakes locked.

255
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:30,236
The brakes locked?

256
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:31,237
Oh, my goodness.
Sit down here.

257
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:32,738
Are you all right?

258
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:33,739
I don't know.

259
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:35,241
He ought to lie down for a little
while.

260
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:36,742
I'd better go home.

261
00:09:36,742 --> 00:09:38,244
And I'll go with him.

262
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:39,245
Where do you live?

263
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:40,246
Staten island.

264
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:41,747
(moans)

265
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:43,749
Look, you don't have to take him all
the way home.

266
00:09:43,749 --> 00:09:45,251
Why don't you take him to my
apartment, Fred.

267
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:45,751
There's nobody there.

268
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:46,752
All right, come on, Buffo.

269
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:48,754
I'd better get the bicycle.

270
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:49,755
I want to see if it's all right.

271
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:51,257
Never mind the bike.

272
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:52,258
I'll mind that.

273
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:53,759
You take care of yourself.

274
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:55,761
Don't worry about tonight.

275
00:09:55,761 --> 00:09:57,263
I'll be okay.

276
00:09:57,263 --> 00:09:59,765
All right, give me seventh in the
books.

277
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:01,767
Everybody on the downbeat.

278
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:03,269
(playing discordant notes)

279
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:04,770
Ay-ay-ay!

280
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:06,772
What kind of a start is that,
fellows?

281
00:10:06,772 --> 00:10:09,775
(all shouting at once)

282
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:36,552
(screaming)

283
00:10:37,053 --> 00:10:38,054
It's me-- Buffo.

284
00:10:38,054 --> 00:10:39,055
It's Buffo!

285
00:10:39,055 --> 00:10:41,057
Buffo, you scared me to death.

286
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:42,558
What are you doing here?

287
00:10:42,558 --> 00:10:44,060
I got hurt at rehearsal this
afternoon,

288
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:46,562
and Ricky said I could come over here

289
00:10:46,562 --> 00:10:48,064
and lie down for a while.

290
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:49,065
Oh... what rehearsal?

291
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:51,067
Are they getting ready for that TV
audition?

292
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:52,568
Sure, the show's tonight.

293
00:10:52,568 --> 00:10:54,070
Tonight? Why, that big bum.

294
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:56,572
So that's why he sent me on a wild
goose chase--

295
00:10:56,572 --> 00:10:58,074
just to get rid of me.

296
00:10:58,074 --> 00:10:59,575
Well, are you all right, Buffo?

297
00:10:59,575 --> 00:11:01,577
Will you be able to do the show
tonight?

298
00:11:01,577 --> 00:11:03,696
Well, I guess I can, if the bicycle
works.

299
00:11:03,696 --> 00:11:04,897
The brakes locked.

300
00:11:04,897 --> 00:11:06,282
Oh.
I'll take a look at it.

301
00:11:06,282 --> 00:11:07,783
Oh, you got it here.

302
00:11:07,783 --> 00:11:08,784
Yeah.

303
00:11:11,287 --> 00:11:12,288
How is it?

304
00:11:12,288 --> 00:11:13,789
Seems all right.

305
00:11:13,789 --> 00:11:15,291
Wait till I try it, huh?

306
00:11:19,795 --> 00:11:21,297
Oh!

307
00:11:27,803 --> 00:11:28,804
Oh!

308
00:11:30,306 --> 00:11:31,307
Here.

309
00:11:32,308 --> 00:11:34,310
Buffo, are you badly hurt?

310
00:11:34,310 --> 00:11:36,812
Oh, you'd better tell Ricky to get
somebody else.

311
00:11:36,812 --> 00:11:37,813
But who?

312
00:11:37,813 --> 00:11:38,814
I don't care.

313
00:11:38,814 --> 00:11:40,816
Why don't you take my place?

314
00:11:40,816 --> 00:11:41,817
Me?

315
00:11:41,817 --> 00:11:43,319
Oh, don't be ridic...

316
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:13,566
Yo quiero pedir que mi negra me
quiera

317
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:18,070
Que tenga dinero y que no se muera

318
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:21,073
Yo le quiero pedir

319
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:22,575
A babalu

320
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:26,078
Una alegra mona como tu

321
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:30,082
Que no tenga otro negro para que no
se muera.

322
00:12:30,082 --> 00:12:31,083
(shouts)

323
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:33,085
iCallo!

324
00:12:33,085 --> 00:12:34,086
iSuave!

325
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:40,593
iBabalu!

326
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:44,096
iBabalu!

327
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:46,599
iBabalu-aye!

328
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:48,601
iBabalu!

329
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:50,603
(shouts)

330
00:12:51,103 --> 00:12:53,105
Yeah!

331
00:12:53,105 --> 00:12:54,607
iSuave!

332
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:56,108
(shouts)

333
00:13:01,113 --> 00:13:02,615
iArriba!

334
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:08,621

00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:10,122

00:13:12,124 --> 00:13:13,626
Ole, ole, ole, ole...

338
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:15,127
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

339
00:13:15,127 --> 00:13:17,129
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

340
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:18,631
Arriba con la conga

341
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:20,633
Arriba con la conga...

342
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:36,649
Yeah!

343
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:40,653

Yeah!

349
00:14:04,176 --> 00:14:05,177
Hey!

350
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:25,981
Isn't Buffo here yet?

351
00:14:25,981 --> 00:14:27,483
No sign of him anywhere.

352
00:14:27,483 --> 00:14:28,984
Oh, that's a fine thing.

353
00:14:28,984 --> 00:14:30,486
Look at that, the sponsors are here.

354
00:14:30,486 --> 00:14:31,987
What am I going to do?

355
00:14:31,987 --> 00:14:33,489
They don't look too happy.

356
00:14:33,489 --> 00:14:34,490
Are you kidding?

357
00:14:34,490 --> 00:14:36,492
For them, that's hilarious.

358
00:14:40,279 --> 00:14:42,631
Well, I'll just have to wrap up the
show.

359
00:14:42,631 --> 00:14:44,133
That's all I can do.

360
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:45,634
Ladies and gentlemen,

361
00:14:45,634 --> 00:14:49,138
we thank you very much for being such
a wonderful audience

362
00:14:49,138 --> 00:14:52,641
but we'll have to conclude the show
because...

363
00:14:52,641 --> 00:14:55,644
Have you seen a fellow named "Risky
Riscardo"?

364
00:14:55,644 --> 00:14:57,146
I'm looking for a fel...

365
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:04,653
I'm looking for a feller named...

366
00:15:04,653 --> 00:15:05,654
Who are you looking for?

367
00:15:05,654 --> 00:15:06,655
(yells)

368
00:15:06,655 --> 00:15:08,657
Who are you looking for?

369
00:15:08,657 --> 00:15:11,160
I'm looking for a feller named Risky
Riscardo.

370
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,661
Well, I'm Ricky Ricardo.

371
00:15:12,661 --> 00:15:14,163
Oh, well, pleased to meet you.

372
00:15:14,663 --> 00:15:15,664
Pleased to meet you.

373
00:15:15,664 --> 00:15:18,167
Do you know where I'd find Risky
Riscardo?

374
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:19,168
Now, look, clown

375
00:15:19,168 --> 00:15:21,170
we're doing a show here, you know.

376
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:22,671
Oh, I know, I know, yeah.

377
00:15:22,671 --> 00:15:24,173
Well, what do you want?

378
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:25,674
I want to be in the band.

379
00:15:25,674 --> 00:15:27,676
Oh, you're a musician.

380
00:15:27,676 --> 00:15:28,661
I am?

381
00:15:30,262 --> 00:15:32,181
Oh, I am, I am, yeah.

382
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:33,182
Where do I sit?

383
00:15:33,182 --> 00:15:35,184
Hey, wait!

384
00:15:35,184 --> 00:15:36,185
Come back here!

385
00:15:36,185 --> 00:15:37,686
Now, look, come back here.

386
00:15:37,686 --> 00:15:38,687
Wait a minute.

387
00:15:38,687 --> 00:15:42,191
What do you think you can do?

388
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:44,193
You think you can just walk up here

389
00:15:44,193 --> 00:15:46,195
and start working with a band

390
00:15:46,195 --> 00:15:47,196
just like that?

391
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:48,197
Just like that?

392
00:15:49,698 --> 00:15:52,201
What do you think this is?

393
00:15:55,704 --> 00:15:58,707
First of all, I'll have to see your
credentials.

394
00:15:58,707 --> 00:16:00,209
(gasping)

395
00:16:08,717 --> 00:16:10,719
Listen, tell me something,
professor--

396
00:16:10,719 --> 00:16:12,721
have you had any experience?

397
00:16:15,507 --> 00:16:17,009
Come over here, please.
Professor,

398
00:16:17,009 --> 00:16:18,010
come right over here.

399
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:21,013
(drum beating with footsteps)

400
00:16:21,013 --> 00:16:23,515
Look, tell me something, do you play
that thing?

401
00:16:23,515 --> 00:16:24,516
How's that?

402
00:16:24,516 --> 00:16:26,452
I said, "Do you play that thin'?"

403
00:16:26,452 --> 00:16:29,621
What "thin"?

404
00:16:29,621 --> 00:16:32,274
Never mind making fun of my English.

405
00:16:32,274 --> 00:16:33,776
That's English?

406
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:38,781
Do you play that instrument?

407
00:16:38,781 --> 00:16:39,782
Where?

408
00:16:39,782 --> 00:16:40,766
Over there.

409
00:16:40,766 --> 00:16:42,034
Where?
There.

410
00:16:42,034 --> 00:16:43,035
Where?
Right there.

411
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:45,504
Oh, there!

412
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:50,426
Do you play it?

413
00:16:50,426 --> 00:16:52,428
Well...

414
00:16:58,434 --> 00:16:59,935
Yeah.

415
00:16:59,935 --> 00:17:01,937
Well, I tell you what we'll do--

416
00:17:01,937 --> 00:17:03,439
we'll give you an audition.

417
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:04,440
Huh?

418
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:05,441
We'll listen to you.

419
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:06,442
Play something for us.

420
00:17:06,442 --> 00:17:07,443
No!
That's right.

421
00:17:07,443 --> 00:17:08,444
Now?
Right now.

422
00:17:08,444 --> 00:17:09,945
Oh, my, will you help me?

423
00:17:09,945 --> 00:17:11,447
I'll help you out, sure.

424
00:17:11,947 --> 00:17:12,448
Thank you.

425
00:17:12,948 --> 00:17:13,949
You're welcome.

426
00:17:25,461 --> 00:17:27,463
(drum beats)

427
00:17:27,463 --> 00:17:35,471
(drum roll)

428
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:39,975
(drum riffs)

429
00:17:39,975 --> 00:17:45,981
(drum roll)

430
00:17:45,981 --> 00:17:46,982
(cymbal tap)

431
00:17:50,486 --> 00:17:52,488
Well, here you are, professor.

432
00:17:52,488 --> 00:17:53,489
Gracias.

433
00:17:53,489 --> 00:17:55,491
Gracias to you, too.

434
00:17:55,491 --> 00:17:57,993
(ratcheting)

435
00:18:05,667 --> 00:18:06,668
(drum beat)

436
00:18:09,171 --> 00:18:10,172
(drum beat)

437
00:18:13,175 --> 00:18:14,176
(drum beat)

438
00:18:22,684 --> 00:18:24,186
(cymbal crash)

439
00:18:29,191 --> 00:18:31,193
Yes, professor?

440
00:18:31,193 --> 00:18:32,694
(mouthing words)

441
00:18:32,694 --> 00:18:34,696
Oh, se quiere acompanamiento

442
00:18:34,696 --> 00:18:35,697
con orquesta.

443
00:18:35,697 --> 00:18:36,698
Huh?

444
00:18:36,698 --> 00:18:38,700
Que se quiere acompanamiento con
orquesta.

445
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:40,702
¿Como lo quiere?
¿En cuatro, en dos

446
00:18:40,702 --> 00:18:42,638
andante, moderato, por arriba?

447
00:18:42,638 --> 00:18:43,872
¿Como lo quiere?

448
00:18:43,872 --> 00:18:46,091
Gracias.

449
00:18:46,091 --> 00:18:47,376
All right, all right.

450
00:18:47,376 --> 00:18:49,378
We'll go with the professor.

451
00:18:49,378 --> 00:18:52,381
On the downbeat, professor, we'll go
with you.

452
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:53,882
Anytime you're ready, professor,
we'll go with you.

453
00:18:55,567 --> 00:18:58,070
(mouthing words)

454
00:18:59,271 --> 00:19:00,589
(yells)

455
00:19:13,602 --> 00:19:17,105
(band playing circus march)

456
00:19:21,610 --> 00:19:23,111
Yeah, boy!

457
00:19:23,111 --> 00:19:28,617
(drum solo)

458
00:19:28,617 --> 00:19:30,118
Look, professor, professor!

459
00:19:30,118 --> 00:19:32,621
Come over here, will you, please?

460
00:19:34,122 --> 00:19:35,624
Look, professor, I'm sorry

461
00:19:35,624 --> 00:19:38,627
but I haven't got any use for a
cellist.

462
00:19:38,627 --> 00:19:39,628
No!

463
00:19:39,628 --> 00:19:41,630
No. I'll tell you what, though--

464
00:19:41,630 --> 00:19:43,131
we have a brand- new instrument...

465
00:19:43,131 --> 00:19:44,633
Oh?

466
00:19:44,633 --> 00:19:46,635
And I've been looking for someone who
can play it.

467
00:19:46,635 --> 00:19:47,636
Oh.

468
00:19:47,636 --> 00:19:48,637
And if you can play it...

469
00:19:48,637 --> 00:19:49,638
Eh?

470
00:19:49,638 --> 00:19:50,639
You've got yourself a job.

471
00:19:51,139 --> 00:19:52,140
Oh...

472
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:53,642
Eh?... oh.

473
00:19:53,642 --> 00:19:55,143
Eh?... oh.

474
00:19:57,646 --> 00:19:59,648
You want to try it?

475
00:19:59,648 --> 00:20:01,149
Well, what is it?

476
00:20:01,650 --> 00:20:04,653
It's a saxovibatronophonavich.

477
00:20:04,653 --> 00:20:07,155
Oh, a saxovibatronophonavich.

478
00:20:07,155 --> 00:20:08,657
That's right. You think you can play
it?

479
00:20:08,657 --> 00:20:09,658
Oh, sure, sure.

480
00:20:09,658 --> 00:20:10,659
Well, wonderful.

481
00:20:10,659 --> 00:20:11,660
Bring it out here!

482
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:13,161
The professor can play it.

483
00:20:13,161 --> 00:20:14,663
We found someone who can play it.

484
00:20:14,663 --> 00:20:15,664
Bring it out here.

485
00:20:15,664 --> 00:20:18,667
Professor, we'll take care of the
cello for you.

486
00:20:18,667 --> 00:20:20,669
It's a saxovibatronophonavich.

487
00:20:20,669 --> 00:20:23,171
It's a saxovibatronophonavich.

488
00:20:23,171 --> 00:20:25,173
It's a saxovibatronophonavich.

489
00:20:25,173 --> 00:20:27,175
It's a saxovibatronophonavich...

490
00:20:27,175 --> 00:20:28,176
(whistles)

491
00:20:28,176 --> 00:20:29,177
Professor!

492
00:20:29,177 --> 00:20:30,679
Right over here, please.

493
00:20:33,181 --> 00:20:34,683
Now, look, professor--

494
00:20:34,683 --> 00:20:36,685
all you got to do is give us a tune,

495
00:20:36,685 --> 00:20:38,687
and you got yourself a job.
Right.

496
00:20:38,687 --> 00:20:39,688
All right?
Right.

497
00:20:39,688 --> 00:20:41,189
Go to it.
Right.

498
00:20:41,189 --> 00:20:42,691
(screams)

499
00:20:44,693 --> 00:20:46,695
That's it right there, professor.

500
00:20:46,695 --> 00:20:48,196
Go ahead, go ahead.

501
00:20:48,196 --> 00:20:49,698
Give us a tune.

502
00:21:05,764 --> 00:21:09,268
(honking "How Dry I Am")

503
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:10,769
(hits sour note)

504
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:13,272
(imitating seal bark)

505
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:15,774
(whistle blows)

506
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:17,776
(band playing circus march)

507
00:21:17,776 --> 00:21:21,280
Hey, professor!
Professor!

508
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:52,144
Ricky...

509
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:53,645
Ricky, where you been?

510
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:55,147
It's after 3:00.

511
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:57,149
Oh, Ricky, talk to me.

512
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:01,653
Oh, I was only trying to help--
honest.

513
00:22:01,653 --> 00:22:05,157
I never dreamed they'd offer me a
contract.

514
00:22:07,659 --> 00:22:09,661
What are you going to do about it?

515
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:13,165
What do you want me to do, Ricky?

516
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:15,167
You know what I want.

517
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:17,669
I just want you to clean the house...

518
00:22:17,669 --> 00:22:19,171
Oh, I've been doing that

519
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:20,672
ever since I got home.

520
00:22:22,174 --> 00:22:23,675
And hand me my slippers

521
00:22:23,675 --> 00:22:25,677
when I come home at night...

522
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:28,680
And cook for you

523
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:31,183
and be the mama for your children.

524
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:36,188
Let's see you pull that out of your
pocket.

525
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:38,190
Well, Ricky, that's what I wanted

526
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:39,691
to talk to you about.

527
00:22:39,691 --> 00:22:41,693
I have a surprise for you.

528
00:22:41,693 --> 00:22:43,195
You do?

529
00:22:43,195 --> 00:22:46,198
Yes-- something that should make you
very happy.

530
00:22:46,198 --> 00:22:48,984
Lucy, you mean...

531
00:22:48,984 --> 00:22:50,485
Yes, darling.

532
00:22:50,485 --> 00:22:51,987
Oh, gosh.

533
00:22:52,487 --> 00:22:54,990
I baked your favorite pie.

2
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:32,032
Good morning, dear.

3
00:00:37,003 --> 00:00:38,788
Uh, what cooks with the breakfast?

4
00:00:38,788 --> 00:00:40,290
Yes, dear.

5
00:00:40,707 --> 00:00:42,492
Oh, breakfast, yeah.

6
00:00:49,999 --> 00:00:52,001
Oh, oh.

7
00:00:52,001 --> 00:00:53,503
What's so interesting?

8
00:00:53,503 --> 00:00:55,505
Numerology, it's just fascinating.

9
00:00:56,005 --> 00:00:58,508
Oh, no, what happened to reading
palms

10
00:00:58,508 --> 00:01:00,009
tea leaves and horoscopes?

11
00:01:00,009 --> 00:01:03,012
Nothing, only this is so much better
than any of them.

12
00:01:03,012 --> 00:01:05,014
Oh, it's a lot of nonsense.

13
00:01:05,014 --> 00:01:07,016
It is not. Now you read that book and
see for yourself, Five.

14
00:01:07,517 --> 00:01:08,518
Five?

15
00:01:08,518 --> 00:01:11,020
Yeah, that's your name in
numerology-- I figured it out.

16
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:12,021
Oh, no.

17
00:01:12,522 --> 00:01:15,024
Drink your two before it gets cold.

18
00:01:15,024 --> 00:01:17,510
Now, wait a minute, before this thing
gets out of hand

19
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:19,913
I think I better nip it in the three.

20
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:22,115
Watch your language!

21
00:01:24,117 --> 00:01:26,619
Now look, honey, you're a grown woman

22
00:01:26,619 --> 00:01:28,121
and this is the 20th century.

23
00:01:28,121 --> 00:01:29,622
Why don't you forget

24
00:01:29,622 --> 00:01:32,125
all these superstitions and crazy
ideas?

25
00:01:32,125 --> 00:01:33,126
They are not crazy ideas.

26
00:01:33,626 --> 00:01:35,128
For all you know, Ricky Ricardo,

27
00:01:35,128 --> 00:01:36,629
you might be going through life

28
00:01:36,629 --> 00:01:37,630
with the wrong name.

29
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:40,133
Hey, I better figure out the right
one for you.

30
00:01:40,133 --> 00:01:42,635
Maybe if you're something besides
five,

31
00:01:42,635 --> 00:01:44,137
it'll help our vibrations.

32
00:01:44,137 --> 00:01:45,638
Lucy.

33
00:01:45,638 --> 00:01:47,140
What?

34
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:49,642
Don't you like the way I vibrate?

35
00:01:49,642 --> 00:01:50,643
Oh, now you be quiet

36
00:01:50,643 --> 00:01:52,579
and let me figure this out.

37
00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:58,118
Let's see now, two and three are five
and "C" is six.

38
00:01:58,118 --> 00:02:01,354
Now we need four and "O" is two.

39
00:02:01,354 --> 00:02:02,555
There you are.

40
00:02:02,555 --> 00:02:04,040
That's the perfect name.

41
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,458
Uh-oh.

42
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:07,160
What is it?

43
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,161
Genevieve.

44
00:02:09,662 --> 00:02:11,164
That'd be interesting.

45
00:02:11,164 --> 00:02:14,667
Of course, you'll have to buy towels
marked "hers" and "hers."

46
00:02:14,667 --> 00:02:16,669
Look, I got a wonderful idea.

47
00:02:16,669 --> 00:02:19,172
Why don't you just call me Ricky
Ricardo

48
00:02:19,172 --> 00:02:21,674
and forget all the numerology
nonsense?

49
00:02:21,674 --> 00:02:23,476
Uh-oh, you dropped some silverware.

50
00:02:23,476 --> 00:02:25,478
That means company is coming.

51
00:02:25,478 --> 00:02:27,480
And it's a fork. That means it's
going to be a woman.

52
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:30,984
Oh, and my palm itches.

53
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:32,986
You know what that means, don't you?

54
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:35,939
The woman is wearing woolen
underwear?

55
00:02:35,939 --> 00:02:36,940
No.

56
00:02:37,941 --> 00:02:39,726
You didn't take a shower this
morning?

57
00:02:39,726 --> 00:02:41,528
No, it means I'm going to get some
money.

58
00:02:41,528 --> 00:02:43,029
Ha!

59
00:02:43,029 --> 00:02:45,031
Now, you just watch-- a woman is
going to come

60
00:02:45,031 --> 00:02:46,533
to the door today and give me some
money.

61
00:02:46,533 --> 00:02:49,469
I tell you what, my witch doctor
friend--

62
00:02:49,469 --> 00:02:51,171
I'll make a deal with you.

63
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:52,422
What?

64
00:02:52,422 --> 00:02:54,424
If a woman comes to the house

65
00:02:54,424 --> 00:02:56,242
and gives you some money

66
00:02:56,242 --> 00:02:58,211
I will give you ten bucks.

67
00:02:58,211 --> 00:02:59,712
Oh, you're a doll.

68
00:03:00,713 --> 00:03:02,715
Thank you.

69
00:03:02,715 --> 00:03:03,716
But...

70
00:03:03,716 --> 00:03:05,218
Oh, but.

71
00:03:05,218 --> 00:03:06,219
Yes, but...

72
00:03:06,219 --> 00:03:09,055
if this loaded female does not
appear, eh?

73
00:03:09,055 --> 00:03:11,691
You will forget all about these
horoscopes,

74
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:13,643
numerology and superstition

75
00:03:13,643 --> 00:03:16,396
and all the rest of the nonsense, all
right?

76
00:03:16,396 --> 00:03:17,397
It's a deal.

77
00:03:17,897 --> 00:03:19,399
It's a deal.

78
00:03:19,399 --> 00:03:21,401
Good morning, Lucy.

79
00:03:21,401 --> 00:03:22,402
She's a woman.

80
00:03:22,402 --> 00:03:24,904
I guess so.

81
00:03:24,904 --> 00:03:27,407
Well, thanks.

82
00:03:27,407 --> 00:03:28,908
Now that that's settled, how are you,
Three?

83
00:03:28,908 --> 00:03:30,410
I'm fine, Seven.

84
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:31,911
Oh.

85
00:03:33,413 --> 00:03:36,916
Five got out on the wrong side of the
bed this morning.

86
00:03:36,916 --> 00:03:37,917
Here's the mail.

87
00:03:37,917 --> 00:03:39,419
Mr. Six just brought it.

88
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:40,420
Oh, thank you.

89
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:42,922
And here's the dollar I borrowed from
you yesterday.

90
00:03:44,924 --> 00:03:46,926
Thank you.

91
00:03:53,433 --> 00:03:55,435
Ay-ay-ay-ay-ay.

92
00:03:57,437 --> 00:03:59,439
I better leave for rehearsal

93
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:01,441
before I lose my sanity.

94
00:04:01,441 --> 00:04:02,942
Good-bye, Three.

95
00:04:02,942 --> 00:04:04,444
Good-bye, Five.

96
00:04:06,446 --> 00:04:09,415
Why do you have that idiotic smile on
your face?

97
00:04:09,415 --> 00:04:13,019
I was just thinking of a perfect 16 I
used to know.

98
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:15,288
Oh, get out of here.

99
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:19,292
Hey, by the way, my barber is going
to call this morning

100
00:04:19,292 --> 00:04:20,793
to see if I can make it

101
00:04:20,793 --> 00:04:22,795
this afternoon for a haircut.

102
00:04:22,795 --> 00:04:23,630
Tell him yes.

103
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:25,098
Oh, wait a minute now, wait a minute.

104
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:26,599
I want to look up your horoscope.

105
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:27,600
This might not be a good day

106
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,601
for you to have a haircut.

107
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:29,602
Good-bye, Lucy.

108
00:04:29,602 --> 00:04:31,104
Wait a minute, here it is-- Gemini,
Gemini.

109
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:32,605
"This is your big day.

110
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:34,724
Everything you do today will turn out
well."

111
00:04:34,724 --> 00:04:37,226
Okay, Ricky, it's all right for you
to get a haircut.

112
00:04:37,226 --> 00:04:38,695
Well, I don't know.

113
00:04:38,695 --> 00:04:39,696
I'm worried.

114
00:04:39,696 --> 00:04:41,447
About what?

115
00:04:41,447 --> 00:04:42,649
You'd better look up the barber

116
00:04:42,649 --> 00:04:44,651
and see if it's a good day for him to
give me a haircut.

117
00:04:44,651 --> 00:04:45,568
Oh...

118
00:04:45,568 --> 00:04:46,569
Now you go on.

119
00:04:46,569 --> 00:04:48,071
You feel free to say yes

120
00:04:48,071 --> 00:04:49,956
to everything today no matter what it
is.

121
00:04:50,356 --> 00:04:52,742
Oh, boy, will I!

122
00:04:55,745 --> 00:04:58,247
Let's see what my horoscope is.

123
00:04:58,247 --> 00:04:59,749
What are you, Ethel?

124
00:05:00,249 --> 00:05:01,250
I'm Leo.

125
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:03,252
And the old lion sure is in a rut.

126
00:05:03,252 --> 00:05:06,255
It says exactly the same thing it
said yesterday.

127
00:05:06,255 --> 00:05:07,256
Really?
Yeah.

128
00:05:07,256 --> 00:05:09,258
Matter of fact, this is yesterday's
paper.

129
00:05:09,258 --> 00:05:10,259
What?

130
00:05:10,259 --> 00:05:11,761
Mm-hmm. See?

131
00:05:11,761 --> 00:05:13,262
Oh, no, and I told Ricky

132
00:05:13,262 --> 00:05:15,114
to say yes to everything today

133
00:05:15,515 --> 00:05:17,483
and this may be his "no" day.

134
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:18,985
What did I do with today's paper?

135
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:20,486
Oh, no.

136
00:05:20,486 --> 00:05:21,988
Oh.

137
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:23,990
I got to find that horoscope.

138
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:26,492
Here it is-- Gemini, Gemini, Gemini.

139
00:05:26,492 --> 00:05:27,493
(gasps)

140
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:28,995
What does it say?

141
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:29,996
"This is not your day.

142
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:31,447
"Danger lurks everywhere.

143
00:05:31,447 --> 00:05:34,567
"Climb in a hole and pull the hole in
after you.

144
00:05:34,567 --> 00:05:36,002
Don't agree to anything."

145
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:37,003
Oh, my goodness.

146
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:38,004
Oh, poor Ricky.

147
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:41,007
Out with a "yes" on his lips on a
"no" day.

148
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:43,292
He shouldn't even go to the barber.

149
00:05:43,292 --> 00:05:45,428
He might lose an ear or something.

150
00:05:45,428 --> 00:05:46,429
(phone rings)

151
00:05:46,429 --> 00:05:47,930
That must be the barber.

152
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:48,931
Hello.

153
00:05:48,931 --> 00:05:50,933
No, the answer is no.

154
00:05:50,933 --> 00:05:53,186
Look, Ricky told me you were going to
call

155
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:55,321
and the answer is no-- N-O.

156
00:05:55,321 --> 00:05:56,139
See here, what is your name?

157
00:05:56,139 --> 00:05:58,124
Merriweather?
Well, listen, Merriweather,

158
00:05:58,124 --> 00:06:00,360
I'm going to recommend to Mr. Ricardo

159
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,962
that he have nothing more to do with
you.

160
00:06:02,962 --> 00:06:04,564
One of his sideburns is always higher

161
00:06:04,564 --> 00:06:05,765
than the other anyway.
Good-bye.

162
00:06:05,765 --> 00:06:07,650
That takes care of Merriweather.

163
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:09,502
You sure saved Ricky from that.

164
00:06:09,502 --> 00:06:11,971
I better call him at the club and
tell him to come home and hide.

165
00:06:11,971 --> 00:06:12,955
I got to go.

166
00:06:12,955 --> 00:06:14,457
So long, Three.

167
00:06:14,457 --> 00:06:15,458
Good-bye, Seven.

168
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:16,959
Lucy!

169
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:19,462
LUCY: Oh, honey, am I glad you came
back!

170
00:06:19,462 --> 00:06:21,464
I was reading the wrong newspaper.

171
00:06:21,464 --> 00:06:23,466
This is one of your bad, bad days of
all time.

172
00:06:23,466 --> 00:06:24,967
You can't talk to anybody

173
00:06:24,967 --> 00:06:26,469
or transact any business.

174
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:27,820
You better get in bed

175
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:29,756
and pull the covers over your head.

176
00:06:29,756 --> 00:06:32,258
I think I'm reasonably safe sitting
here.

177
00:06:32,258 --> 00:06:33,760
Well, honey, I don't know.

178
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,094
Did anybody call?

179
00:06:35,094 --> 00:06:36,896
Just the barber-- I told him no.

180
00:06:36,896 --> 00:06:38,164
Nobody else?
No.

181
00:06:38,164 --> 00:06:40,149
Well, good. I came back because I
remember I'm expecting

182
00:06:40,149 --> 00:06:42,151
a very important phone call here this
morning.

183
00:06:42,151 --> 00:06:43,152
What about?

184
00:06:43,152 --> 00:06:44,654
I don't want to talk about it.

185
00:06:44,654 --> 00:06:47,156
It's bad luck to talk about a big
deal before it's set.

186
00:06:47,156 --> 00:06:48,658
Just keep your fingers crossed.

187
00:06:48,658 --> 00:06:52,945
Well, if it's that big, I'll do
better than that.

188
00:06:54,447 --> 00:06:56,949
Aren't you overdoing it a little?

189
00:06:56,949 --> 00:06:58,451
I'm not finished yet.

190
00:07:03,956 --> 00:07:05,958
Well, that should keep the bad
spirits away.

191
00:07:05,958 --> 00:07:08,428
Now, go in the kitchen and do your
dishes

192
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:10,430
and don't think about it anymore.

193
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,215
The call should come through any
minute.

194
00:07:12,715 --> 00:07:14,717
Well, I'm not gonna uncross anything.

195
00:07:21,224 --> 00:07:23,726
You sure nobody called?

196
00:07:23,726 --> 00:07:25,728
Just the barber.

197
00:07:25,728 --> 00:07:27,730
Well, that's good, because I want to
make sure

198
00:07:27,730 --> 00:07:29,732
to talk to Mr. Merriweather
personally.

199
00:07:31,734 --> 00:07:33,786
What's the matter?

200
00:07:33,786 --> 00:07:36,072
Ricky, what's your barber's name?

201
00:07:36,072 --> 00:07:37,073
Nick.

202
00:07:37,073 --> 00:07:38,574
Nick what?

203
00:07:38,574 --> 00:07:40,359
Vascalupas.

204
00:07:42,662 --> 00:07:44,664
Just as a matter of idle curiosity

205
00:07:44,664 --> 00:07:46,399
who's Mr. Merriweather?

206
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:48,518
Well, I guess there's no harm in
telling you.

207
00:07:48,518 --> 00:07:51,838
He's one of the biggest theatrical
producers in town

208
00:07:51,838 --> 00:07:53,673
and he's going to call me here this
morning

209
00:07:54,173 --> 00:07:56,108
and offer me a job in one of his next
shows.

210
00:07:56,108 --> 00:07:56,909
Isn't that wonderful?

211
00:07:56,909 --> 00:07:59,312
Oh, yeah, wonderful.

212
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:01,814
Ah, honey, if this thing comes
through,

213
00:08:01,814 --> 00:08:02,815
all our worries are over.

214
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:05,818
You can have anything that you ever
dreamed about.

215
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:06,819
I'm going to buy you

216
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:08,821
the biggest diamond ring in town.

217
00:08:08,821 --> 00:08:10,106
Diamond ring?

218
00:08:10,106 --> 00:08:13,109
Yes, and I'm going to buy you a
full-length mink coat.

219
00:08:13,109 --> 00:08:15,111
A mink coat?

220
00:08:15,111 --> 00:08:17,613
And the longest, shiniest Cadillac

221
00:08:17,613 --> 00:08:18,614
in the whole world.

222
00:08:18,614 --> 00:08:21,117
(wailing)

223
00:08:23,619 --> 00:08:26,622
Lucy, is there something wrong?

224
00:08:26,622 --> 00:08:29,125
Oh, Ricky, I've done a terrible
thing.

225
00:08:29,125 --> 00:08:31,427
But before I tell you, is there any
chance

226
00:08:31,427 --> 00:08:34,013
that Vascalupas has changed his name
to Merriweather?

227
00:08:35,731 --> 00:08:37,183
Lucy...

228
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:38,518
Lucy?

229
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:39,936
What have you done?

230
00:08:39,936 --> 00:08:41,437
Lucy, what have you done?

231
00:08:41,437 --> 00:08:43,439
Stand still and I'll tell you.

232
00:08:43,439 --> 00:08:44,941
Well?

233
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:45,942
Well, Mr. Merriweather called

234
00:08:45,942 --> 00:08:47,443
and I thought it was the barber and I
told him no.

235
00:08:47,443 --> 00:08:48,444
What?!

236
00:08:48,444 --> 00:08:49,946
I was only trying to help!

237
00:08:49,946 --> 00:08:50,446
Help?!

238
00:08:50,446 --> 00:08:51,447
Help!

239
00:08:51,447 --> 00:08:53,449
I'll call him and explain.

240
00:08:53,449 --> 00:08:56,452
You'll do better than that.

241
00:08:56,452 --> 00:08:59,455
You're going to go down there in
person

242
00:08:59,455 --> 00:09:00,456
on your knees.
Come on.

243
00:09:00,456 --> 00:09:03,960
Oh, won't we get there faster if we
take a cab?

244
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:04,961
Come on.

245
00:09:13,669 --> 00:09:15,171
Tillie.

246
00:09:15,171 --> 00:09:17,173
Tillie.

247
00:09:17,173 --> 00:09:21,594
Tillie, if you can hear me, answer on
the Ouija board.

248
00:09:21,594 --> 00:09:25,181
(phone buzzes)

249
00:09:25,181 --> 00:09:26,182
Yes?

250
00:09:26,182 --> 00:09:28,734
Oh, send them in.

251
00:09:35,741 --> 00:09:37,243
Hello, Mr. Ricardo.

252
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:38,744
Hello, Mr. Merriweather.

253
00:09:38,744 --> 00:09:40,246
This is my wife, Lucy.

254
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:41,747
She has something to tell you.

255
00:09:41,747 --> 00:09:43,749
Oh, how charming.

256
00:09:43,749 --> 00:09:45,751
Mr. Merriweather, it was a big
mistake

257
00:09:45,751 --> 00:09:47,253
saying no to you today.

258
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:48,254
You see, I thought...

259
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:50,256
Oh, wait, please, please.

260
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:53,259
I can't discuss any more business
today.

261
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:54,760
It's after 12:00.

262
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,262
After 12:00?

263
00:09:56,262 --> 00:10:00,766
Yes, my horoscope says no more
business after noon today.

264
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:02,768
Oh, you follow horoscopes?

265
00:10:02,768 --> 00:10:05,771
Yes.
I'm Scorpio.

266
00:10:05,771 --> 00:10:07,273
Oh, I'm Taurus.

267
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:08,874
I'm cooked.

268
00:10:09,742 --> 00:10:12,561
Well, won't you, won't you sit down?

269
00:10:12,561 --> 00:10:13,562
Yes.

270
00:10:13,562 --> 00:10:15,564
You see, you see, Mr. Merriweather,

271
00:10:15,564 --> 00:10:16,565
the reason that I said no

272
00:10:17,066 --> 00:10:18,567
was because Ricky's horoscope said

273
00:10:18,567 --> 00:10:21,737
that it was a very bad day for him to
accept anything.

274
00:10:21,737 --> 00:10:23,239
Oh, yes, I understand perfectly.

275
00:10:23,239 --> 00:10:24,740
Well, Mr. Merriweather, if you
understand,

276
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:26,959
maybe we could discuss about...

277
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:28,377
Oh, Ricky, if the stars say

278
00:10:28,878 --> 00:10:29,879
that he can't discuss business,

279
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:31,731
that means he can't discuss it.

280
00:10:31,731 --> 00:10:34,000
Now, you see, important people like
Mr. Merriweather

281
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,902
are interested in horoscopes,
numerology and all of that.

282
00:10:36,902 --> 00:10:39,205
Oh, you study numerology?

283
00:10:39,205 --> 00:10:41,207
Of course.

284
00:10:41,207 --> 00:10:42,174
I'm a one.

285
00:10:42,575 --> 00:10:44,176
I'm a three.

286
00:10:45,411 --> 00:10:47,413
I'm a five.

287
00:10:47,413 --> 00:10:50,016
We're all odd, aren't we?

288
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:00,192
Do you Ouija?

289
00:11:01,394 --> 00:11:02,611
How's that?

290
00:11:02,611 --> 00:11:05,598
Do you Ouija?

291
00:11:05,598 --> 00:11:07,616
Well, I'm not sure.

292
00:11:07,616 --> 00:11:09,618
I mean, have you had any success

293
00:11:09,618 --> 00:11:11,120
with the Ouija board?

294
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,621
Oh, Ouija board!

295
00:11:12,621 --> 00:11:15,124
Oh, no, I haven't gotten around to
that yet.

296
00:11:15,124 --> 00:11:17,877
Oh, too bad-- I've worn out three of
them

297
00:11:17,877 --> 00:11:20,629
trying to contact my dear, departed
Tillie

298
00:11:20,629 --> 00:11:22,715
who left me three years ago.

299
00:11:22,715 --> 00:11:25,201
Oh, I understand.

300
00:11:25,201 --> 00:11:27,319
I wish I could find a good séance.

301
00:11:27,319 --> 00:11:29,021
You wouldn't happen to know

302
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:30,439
where they're having one

303
00:11:30,439 --> 00:11:32,058
Mrs. Ricardo, would you?

304
00:11:32,058 --> 00:11:33,859
Well, now, it just happens

305
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:37,947
that we're having a séance at our
house tonight.

306
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:39,448
We are?

307
00:11:39,448 --> 00:11:40,950
Oh, we are, we are.

308
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:43,402
And we'd love to have you come.

309
00:11:43,402 --> 00:11:45,204
We just happen to have a vacant
chair.

310
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:47,707
Oh, I just can't wait.

311
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:51,544
Who knows? I may even get to talk to
Tillie tonight.

312
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,142
Lucy, this is just plain silly.

313
00:12:06,142 --> 00:12:08,144
If Mr. Merriweather finds out

314
00:12:08,144 --> 00:12:10,146
that we're doing this just for him,

315
00:12:10,146 --> 00:12:12,148
he'll never give me a job.

316
00:12:12,148 --> 00:12:13,149
Oh, honey, he won't find out.

317
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:15,151
Now, Ethel will be the medium

318
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:16,652
and you and I and Fred will just it
here hold hands.

319
00:12:16,652 --> 00:12:18,654
Well, what good would that do?

320
00:12:18,654 --> 00:12:20,156
Well, now, you never can tell.

321
00:12:20,156 --> 00:12:22,158
Before the evening is over, we may
see a spook.

322
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:24,160
Don't tell me you invited your
mother.

323
00:12:26,929 --> 00:12:28,147
Well!

324
00:12:28,147 --> 00:12:34,336
(humming snake charmer music)

325
00:12:39,341 --> 00:12:42,344
Introducing Rhea, the medium.

326
00:12:43,345 --> 00:12:45,848
Well done, medium Rhea.

327
00:12:45,848 --> 00:12:49,351
(all laughing)

328
00:12:49,351 --> 00:12:51,353
Ethel, you look sensational.

329
00:12:51,353 --> 00:12:52,354
That's a wonderful getup.

330
00:12:52,354 --> 00:12:53,856
Isn't it?

331
00:12:53,856 --> 00:12:54,857
Fred, what are you doing with this?

332
00:12:55,357 --> 00:12:56,859
It's not a Shriners' convention, you
know.

333
00:12:56,859 --> 00:12:58,861
Come on, Fred, help me get some ice.

334
00:12:58,861 --> 00:12:59,862
All right.

335
00:12:59,862 --> 00:13:01,864
Oh, bring the bucket, will you?

336
00:13:01,864 --> 00:13:03,365
Ethel, I want to tell you something

337
00:13:03,365 --> 00:13:03,866
before the boys come back.

338
00:13:04,366 --> 00:13:04,867
What?

339
00:13:05,367 --> 00:13:06,368
I have a feeling

340
00:13:06,368 --> 00:13:08,120
we're going to contact the other side
tonight.

341
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,121
Yeah? What makes you think so?

342
00:13:09,121 --> 00:13:11,624
Shake hands with Tillie Merriweather.

343
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:12,625
Huh?

344
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:14,627
Ricky will kill me if he knows what
I'm planning,

345
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:16,128
but after everybody gets seated,

346
00:13:16,128 --> 00:13:17,630
I'm going to sneak away from the
circle

347
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:19,632
and I'm going to be the voice of
Tillie.

348
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:20,633
Where will you be?

349
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:22,635
Well, I'll be right over there behind
you, near the fireplace.

350
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:25,137
Help me with the chairs.

351
00:13:28,107 --> 00:13:29,925
Listen, Fred, Lucy will kill me

352
00:13:29,925 --> 00:13:31,927
for even thinking about this,

353
00:13:31,927 --> 00:13:35,931
but as long as we're going to go
through with the séance,

354
00:13:36,432 --> 00:13:39,935
Mr. Merriweather might as well really
contact his wife.

355
00:13:40,436 --> 00:13:41,437
Yeah.

356
00:13:41,437 --> 00:13:43,439
Now, would you care to help me,

357
00:13:43,939 --> 00:13:45,191
Mrs. Merriweather?

358
00:13:45,191 --> 00:13:48,410
I think you've snapped your twig,
son.

359
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:50,412
Now look, Fred, it's very simple.

360
00:13:50,913 --> 00:13:52,398
All you have to do is pretend

361
00:13:52,398 --> 00:13:53,999
that you have a headache

362
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:56,001
and that you want to go downstairs to
bed, see?

363
00:13:56,001 --> 00:13:58,504
Then, as soon as the séance gets
going,

364
00:13:58,504 --> 00:14:00,506
I'll stamp my foot twice, you sneak
up,

365
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:03,876
and pretend to be the voice of Mrs.
Merriweather.

366
00:14:03,876 --> 00:14:07,413
Now, do you think you can sound like
a female spirit?

367
00:14:07,413 --> 00:14:08,631
(high voice): Well, I don't know,

368
00:14:08,631 --> 00:14:11,750
but I can certainly try, dear old
boy.

369
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:12,718
Good girl.

370
00:14:12,718 --> 00:14:15,221
I mean, uh...
I meant, good boy.

371
00:14:15,221 --> 00:14:16,472
Now listen, Fred,

372
00:14:16,472 --> 00:14:19,942
don't be too obvious about the
headache.

373
00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:22,695
We don't want them to suspect
anything.

374
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:24,196
Don't ham it up.

375
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:30,703
(moaning)

376
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:40,212
Fred, is something wrong?

377
00:14:40,212 --> 00:14:41,580
It's my head.

378
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:43,082
Oh.

379
00:14:43,082 --> 00:14:44,583
Aren't we going to have fun

380
00:14:44,583 --> 00:14:45,584
at this séance?

381
00:14:45,584 --> 00:14:47,086
Well, I guess so.

382
00:14:47,086 --> 00:14:50,055
You look seriously ill to me.

383
00:14:50,055 --> 00:14:52,057
Oh, if it's his head, he's all right.

384
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:54,059
There's nothing up there to hurt.

385
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:56,061
Why, you cruel, heartless woman.

386
00:14:56,061 --> 00:14:58,063
Speaking to a sick man like this

387
00:14:58,063 --> 00:14:59,565
without any sympathy.

388
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:02,067
Fred, you better go to bed
downstairs.

389
00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:03,502
Go to bed, Fred.

390
00:15:03,502 --> 00:15:05,321
(doorbell buzzes)

391
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:10,826
Oh, good evening, Mr.
Merriweather, come in.

392
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:12,328
Hello, Mrs. Ricardo.

393
00:15:12,328 --> 00:15:13,829
Good evening.

394
00:15:13,829 --> 00:15:14,830
Oh, good evening, Mr. Merriweather.

395
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:15,831
I'll take your coat and hat.

396
00:15:15,831 --> 00:15:16,832
Thank you.

397
00:15:16,832 --> 00:15:20,336
Mr. Merriweather, I'd like to present

398
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:22,338
Madame Ethel Mertzola.

399
00:15:22,338 --> 00:15:25,341
She's going to be our medium tonight.

400
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:26,659
She's psychopathic.

401
00:15:26,659 --> 00:15:28,594
How do you do?

402
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:31,597
Oh, how do you do?

403
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:35,100
Oh, I've been thinking about this all
afternoon.

404
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:37,102
You know, I have a feeling that
tonight

405
00:15:37,102 --> 00:15:39,104
I'm going to contact Tillie.

406
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:41,390
BOTH: So have I.

407
00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:42,891
Well, is everybody ready?

408
00:15:43,392 --> 00:15:44,893
Yes, I feel real trancey.

409
00:15:44,893 --> 00:15:45,894
Good.

410
00:15:45,894 --> 00:15:47,396
Uh, you sit here, Mr. Merriweather.

411
00:15:47,396 --> 00:15:48,897
Ricky, you're over there, dear.

412
00:15:48,897 --> 00:15:49,898
All right.

413
00:15:49,898 --> 00:15:51,400
I'll turn out the lights.

414
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:54,403
Okay, I'll move this one over here.

415
00:15:54,403 --> 00:15:55,404
All right, Madame.

416
00:15:57,906 --> 00:16:02,828
Now, everybody join hands.

417
00:16:04,246 --> 00:16:06,665
Now everybody close their eyes

418
00:16:06,665 --> 00:16:09,668
and keep them tightly closed.

419
00:16:09,668 --> 00:16:12,054
The spirits must not see

420
00:16:12,054 --> 00:16:14,440
the whites of your eyes.

421
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:17,643
Close your eyes and concentrate.

422
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:18,844
(sneezes)

423
00:16:18,844 --> 00:16:19,762
Oh, excuse me.

424
00:16:19,762 --> 00:16:21,263
God bless you.

425
00:16:21,263 --> 00:16:23,265
Oh, thank you.

426
00:16:27,770 --> 00:16:30,839
I am now going into a trance.

427
00:16:30,839 --> 00:16:34,460
I shall try to contact Tillie.

428
00:16:35,778 --> 00:16:40,766
The next voice you hear will be the
voice of Tillie.

429
00:16:40,766 --> 00:16:41,583
Oh.

430
00:16:44,536 --> 00:16:46,972
What's the matter?

431
00:16:46,972 --> 00:16:48,974
Um, my foot was asleep.

432
00:16:50,426 --> 00:16:51,427
Oh.

433
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:52,778
Is everyone comfortable now?

434
00:16:52,778 --> 00:16:54,013
I'm comfortable.

435
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:55,614
Are you, Ricky?

436
00:16:55,614 --> 00:16:57,082
Yes, I am. How about you, Lucy?

437
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:00,686
Yes, I'm comfortable.

438
00:17:02,554 --> 00:17:03,856
All right, here we go.

439
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:08,427
I shall now contact Tillie.

440
00:17:08,427 --> 00:17:10,029
Ethel to Tillie.

441
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:11,630
Ethel to Tillie.

442
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:16,035
Come in, Tillie, over.

443
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:21,156
(sneezes)

444
00:17:21,156 --> 00:17:23,208
Tillie.

445
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:24,410
Tillie, is that you?

446
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:29,314
(high voice): Yes, it's me, Tillie.

447
00:17:29,314 --> 00:17:32,918
But Tillie, that sneeze, are you
sick?

448
00:17:32,918 --> 00:17:35,754
(normal voice): Sick? I'm dead.

449
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:39,425
Oh, that's right.

450
00:17:41,427 --> 00:17:46,632
But wait, if you're a spirit, how can
you have a cold?

451
00:17:46,632 --> 00:17:51,837
(high voice): I went out last night
without my shroud.

452
00:17:51,837 --> 00:17:53,439
Oh.

453
00:17:53,439 --> 00:17:55,107
Ow!

454
00:17:55,107 --> 00:17:56,775
(high voice): I mean, owww.

455
00:17:56,775 --> 00:17:59,178
What's the matter?

456
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:01,380
Oh, I burned myself.

457
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:03,565
It's awfully hot here.

458
00:18:03,565 --> 00:18:06,452
Oh, that's where you are!

459
00:18:08,053 --> 00:18:11,657
Oh, Tillie, I'm so disappointed in
you.

460
00:18:11,657 --> 00:18:14,860
Oh, well, I have to go now.

461
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:17,262
Oh, no, no, no! No, wait, Tillie,
wait.

462
00:18:17,262 --> 00:18:21,667
Tillie, I've always wanted to ask you
something.

463
00:18:21,667 --> 00:18:22,868
What?

464
00:18:22,868 --> 00:18:24,470
Tell me, Tillie--

465
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:28,874
who did you like the best, me or Mrs.
Merriweather?

466
00:18:31,009 --> 00:18:32,611
Huh?

467
00:18:33,479 --> 00:18:36,448
I said, who did you like the best,

468
00:18:36,448 --> 00:18:38,851
me or Mrs. Merriweather?

469
00:18:38,851 --> 00:18:42,287
Well, you, of course.

470
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:45,591
Oh, this is the most exciting day in
my life.

471
00:18:45,591 --> 00:18:47,376
Tillie liked me the best.

472
00:18:47,376 --> 00:18:51,663
Oh, now...
Now, if... if I may,

473
00:18:51,663 --> 00:18:55,100
I'd like to try and contact Mrs.
Merriweather.

474
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:57,553
Mrs. Merriweather?

475
00:18:58,837 --> 00:19:00,038
Well, all right.

476
00:19:00,038 --> 00:19:01,707
Ethel to Mrs.
Merriweather.

477
00:19:01,707 --> 00:19:03,709
Ethel to Mrs. Merriweather.

478
00:19:03,709 --> 00:19:05,344
Come in, Mrs.
Merriweather.

479
00:19:05,744 --> 00:19:06,945
Over.

480
00:19:06,945 --> 00:19:09,648
FRED (high voice): Hello!

481
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:16,471
Is... is that you, my dear?

482
00:19:16,471 --> 00:19:18,991
Yes, darling.

483
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:20,325
Darling?

484
00:19:20,325 --> 00:19:23,061
That doesn't sound like Adelaide.

485
00:19:23,061 --> 00:19:25,063
Shut up, you worm!

486
00:19:25,063 --> 00:19:26,899
That's Adelaide!

487
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:32,237
Oh, what terrible memories it brings
back to me.

488
00:19:32,237 --> 00:19:33,839
Uh, my trance is wearing off.

489
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:35,507
I think you'd better hang up now.

490
00:19:35,507 --> 00:19:37,943
All right, good-bye, Adelaide.

491
00:19:37,943 --> 00:19:41,146
Good-bye.

492
00:19:41,146 --> 00:19:43,549
Good-bye, Tillie.

493
00:19:43,549 --> 00:19:46,552
LUCY (high voice): Good-bye.

494
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:54,026
Well, everybody unclasp hands now.

495
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:55,027
Open your eyes.

496
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:57,029
Well, this has certainly been

497
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:58,530
an eventful evening.

498
00:19:58,530 --> 00:19:59,531
Yes.

499
00:19:59,531 --> 00:20:01,533
Well, I must dash home immediately

500
00:20:01,533 --> 00:20:03,035
and write it in my diary.

501
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:05,037
RICKY: I'll get your coat, sir.

502
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:06,538
Thank you.
Oh, Mrs. Ricardo,

503
00:20:06,538 --> 00:20:08,040
I just can't thank you enough.

504
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,041
Well, it's been a pleasure.

505
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:10,542
Good night, Madame Mertzola.

506
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:11,543
Oh, good night.

507
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:17,049
I'll walk you downstairs.

508
00:20:24,923 --> 00:20:25,924
Oh, Lucy, you were great.

509
00:20:26,425 --> 00:20:28,927
I'd never have known you did those
two voices.

510
00:20:30,929 --> 00:20:32,931
I didn't.

511
00:20:32,931 --> 00:20:33,932
You didn't?

512
00:20:33,932 --> 00:20:34,933
No.

513
00:20:34,933 --> 00:20:38,203
Ethel, you underestimate your
transmitter.

514
00:20:39,805 --> 00:20:43,742
You really contacted the other side.

515
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:44,943
(gasps)

516
00:20:44,943 --> 00:20:46,194
I did?

517
00:20:46,194 --> 00:20:47,195
Yes.

518
00:20:47,195 --> 00:20:48,914
Oh, Lucy, I'm frightened.

519
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:50,198
So am I.

520
00:20:53,201 --> 00:20:54,703
Hello, Fred.

521
00:20:54,703 --> 00:20:55,704
Hello.

522
00:21:17,743 --> 00:21:19,027
Yippee!

523
00:21:19,027 --> 00:21:20,529
(all scream)

524
00:21:23,031 --> 00:21:24,032
Honey...

525
00:21:24,032 --> 00:21:26,535
you got the best horoscopes in town.

526
00:21:26,535 --> 00:21:27,035
Well, thank you.

527
00:21:27,035 --> 00:21:28,036
You know what he did?
What?

528
00:21:28,036 --> 00:21:30,038
Mr. Merriweather gave me an even
better job.

529
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:32,541
He's going to star me in one of his
next shows.

530
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:35,043
(all congratulating him)

531
00:21:35,043 --> 00:21:37,546
Oh, listen, Ricky, I have a
confession to make.

532
00:21:37,546 --> 00:21:38,547
I did a terrible thing.

533
00:21:38,547 --> 00:21:40,048
I was the voice of Tillie.

534
00:21:40,048 --> 00:21:42,551
But that other voice, Mrs.
Merriweather,

535
00:21:42,551 --> 00:21:44,052
it was real.

536
00:21:44,052 --> 00:21:47,556
(high voice): It certainly was.

537
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:50,976
Fred Mertz.

538
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:52,344
You were the other voice.

539
00:21:52,344 --> 00:21:55,597
Yeah, and I thought Tillie was a real
spook.

540
00:21:55,597 --> 00:21:56,598
Oh, no!

541
00:21:57,599 --> 00:21:58,600
Wait a minute, wait a minute,

542
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:00,602
there's something else I don't
understand.

543
00:22:00,602 --> 00:22:02,104
If Tillie wasn't Mrs.
Merriweather, who was she?

544
00:22:02,104 --> 00:22:05,107
Oh, well, um, Mr. Merriweather
explained that to me,

545
00:22:05,107 --> 00:22:07,609
and he paid you a great compliment.

546
00:22:07,609 --> 00:22:09,611
He said he knew it was the real thing

547
00:22:09,611 --> 00:22:11,613
because it sounded exactly like
Tillie

548
00:22:11,613 --> 00:22:13,115
if she could talk.

549
00:22:13,115 --> 00:22:15,117
Well, that's very flattering.

550
00:22:15,117 --> 00:22:16,618
If she could talk?

551
00:22:16,618 --> 00:22:18,120
Well, you see

552
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:22,174
Tillie was Mr.
Merriweather's cocker spaniel.

553
00:22:22,174 --> 00:22:23,592
Oh, no!

Hello.

Oh, hi, Ethel.

5
00:00:38,405 --> 00:00:39,906
Oh, just straightening up.

6
00:00:39,906 --> 00:00:42,409
You know I can't stand it if the
house isn't neat.

7
00:00:42,409 --> 00:00:45,545
A place for everything and everything
in its place.

8
00:00:45,545 --> 00:00:46,746
That's the way I like it.

9
00:00:46,746 --> 00:00:49,549
Well, Ricky ought to be home any
minute.

10
00:00:49,549 --> 00:00:50,350
No, I had dinner.

11
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:52,752
Ricky ate downtown at the club.

12
00:00:52,752 --> 00:00:55,555
Gee, I don't know what we're doing
tonight.

13
00:00:55,555 --> 00:00:57,957
I'll call you back after Ricky gets
home.

14
00:00:57,957 --> 00:00:59,175
Okay, dear.

Hi.

27
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:28,541
Well!

28
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:29,742
What's the matter?

29
00:03:29,742 --> 00:03:32,145
How could a cyclone hit in here

30
00:03:32,145 --> 00:03:34,147
and not hit in the kitchen?

31
00:03:34,147 --> 00:03:36,149
What are you talking about, a
cyclone?

32
00:03:36,149 --> 00:03:38,001
Well, something hit this room.

33
00:03:38,001 --> 00:03:40,303
Where? I don't see anything wrong.

34
00:03:40,303 --> 00:03:41,304
Oh, you don't?

35
00:03:41,304 --> 00:03:42,805
Would you mind telling me, please,

36
00:03:42,805 --> 00:03:45,308
what all these clothes are doing here
in the living room?

37
00:03:45,308 --> 00:03:46,809
Oh, that's where I took them off.

38
00:03:46,809 --> 00:03:48,311
Would you put them away for me, dear?

39
00:03:48,311 --> 00:03:50,797
Look, honey, there's a new invention
you'll just love--

40
00:03:50,797 --> 00:03:52,599
it's a hole in the wall, has a long
pole in it,

41
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:54,067
little metal things hanging on it

42
00:03:54,467 --> 00:03:57,237
and it's called a coat closet.

43
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:59,939
Well, what won't they think of next?

44
00:03:59,939 --> 00:04:01,241
Oh, honestly, Ricky.

45
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:03,743
How can you men be so sloppy and
dirty?

46
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:06,246
You're nothing but a bunch of mess
cats.

47
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:09,616
There's nothing sloppy and dirty
about this room.

48
00:04:09,616 --> 00:04:11,000
It just looks, uh, lived in.

49
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,754
Well, that's a good answer if you
happen to be a pig.

50
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:17,206
Honey, just drop the subject, will
you?

51
00:04:17,206 --> 00:04:18,207
I'd be glad to drop it

52
00:04:18,207 --> 00:04:20,710
if there's any more room on the
floor.

53
00:04:20,710 --> 00:04:23,896
You can't expect me to live in a
museum.

54
00:04:24,297 --> 00:04:28,601
A man's home is his castle, and this
is my castle.

55
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:31,104
Oh, all right, your majesty.

56
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:33,606
I bow to Ricardo the first...

57
00:04:33,606 --> 00:04:35,608
king of the slobs.

58
00:04:38,544 --> 00:04:41,948
Thank you, my faithful subject.

59
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:44,951
Don't expect this slave to pick up
after you.

60
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:47,453
If you want the house to look like
this, okay,

61
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:49,455
you can just sit and wallow in it.

62
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:52,458
Ay, Lucy, Lucy, Lucy.

63
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:55,461
Well, here's a whole spread on Tommy
Dorsey at home,

64
00:04:55,461 --> 00:04:57,063
and you know something?

65
00:04:57,063 --> 00:04:58,264
What?

66
00:04:58,264 --> 00:05:00,667
He has his shoes on and a tie, too.

67
00:05:00,667 --> 00:05:01,868
Yeah? What-what magazine is that?

68
00:05:02,268 --> 00:05:04,387
Your musician's magazine, The Half
Beat.

69
00:05:04,387 --> 00:05:05,388
It is?

70
00:05:05,888 --> 00:05:06,889
Let me see that.

71
00:05:08,391 --> 00:05:09,392
Well, how do you like that?

72
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:10,893
My press agent told me

73
00:05:10,893 --> 00:05:13,096
I was going to get the next spread.

74
00:05:13,096 --> 00:05:15,598
It was going to be "Ricky Ricardo At
Home."

75
00:05:15,598 --> 00:05:16,883
What magazine was it going to be in,

76
00:05:16,883 --> 00:05:18,935
Better Homes and Garbage?

77
00:05:20,353 --> 00:05:22,021
No, smarty, in that magazine.

78
00:05:22,021 --> 00:05:24,023
That's a very important magazine

79
00:05:24,524 --> 00:05:25,825
in the music business.

80
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:27,827
Wait till I hear from Kenny.

81
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:29,329
Some press agent he is.

82
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:31,331
(phone rings)

83
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:32,332
Hello.

84
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:33,833
Hi, Ethel.

85
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:37,337
Hi, dear.

86
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:39,272
No, I don't think we're doing
anything.

87
00:05:39,272 --> 00:05:41,274
Why don't you and Fred come on up.

88
00:05:41,274 --> 00:05:42,075
Okay.

89
00:05:42,075 --> 00:05:43,543
Ethel and Fred are coming up, honey.

90
00:05:43,543 --> 00:05:45,545
Put your shoes on and pick up those
papers.

91
00:05:45,545 --> 00:05:46,546
What for?

92
00:05:46,546 --> 00:05:48,047
Because company is coming.

93
00:05:48,047 --> 00:05:51,434
It isn't company, it's Fred and
Ethel.

94
00:05:51,434 --> 00:05:53,436
Well, put your shoes on.

95
00:05:53,436 --> 00:05:55,722
They know I have feet.

96
00:05:55,722 --> 00:05:57,357
Ricky, are you going to help me

97
00:05:57,357 --> 00:05:59,308
clean up this place or aren't you?

98
00:05:59,308 --> 00:06:00,309
No, this is my home

99
00:06:00,309 --> 00:06:02,311
and I want to be comfortable in it.

100
00:06:02,311 --> 00:06:03,312
Your home?

101
00:06:03,312 --> 00:06:05,031
What does that make me, a visiting
relative?

102
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:06,632
Oh, honey, I didn't mean it that way.

103
00:06:06,632 --> 00:06:07,867
You know, I was under the impression

104
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:10,319
that half of everything in this house
was mine.

105
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:11,571
All right, all right,

106
00:06:11,571 --> 00:06:13,823
you go ahead and clean your half of
everything

107
00:06:13,823 --> 00:06:15,825
and leave my half just the way it is.

108
00:06:17,944 --> 00:06:20,747
All right, we'll divide the room in
half.

109
00:06:20,747 --> 00:06:23,216
I'll keep my half the way I want to,

110
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:25,551
you keep your half any way you
please.

111
00:06:25,551 --> 00:06:27,053
Are you kidding?

112
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:28,421
No, I'm very serious.

113
00:06:28,421 --> 00:06:29,338
Huh.

114
00:06:29,338 --> 00:06:32,625
We'll make a line right about here.

115
00:06:32,625 --> 00:06:34,627
Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay.

116
00:06:34,627 --> 00:06:38,064
Esta mujer esta absolutamente loca.

117
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:39,565
Never mind that.

118
00:06:40,566 --> 00:06:42,568
Now, honey, wait just a minute.

119
00:06:42,568 --> 00:06:44,070
Just stay right over there.

120
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:45,071
That's your line.

121
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:47,573
You can't come over here without a
passport.

122
00:06:47,573 --> 00:06:49,075
Oh, for goodness' sakes.

123
00:06:49,575 --> 00:06:50,576
Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh.

124
00:06:50,576 --> 00:06:51,577
That's on the line.

125
00:06:51,577 --> 00:06:53,079
I just want a cigarette!

126
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:55,798
Well, half of what's in this pack is
mine.

127
00:06:56,299 --> 00:06:59,802
You mean that's the only cigarette we
have in the house?

128
00:06:59,802 --> 00:07:01,804
Yep. You get Philip and I get Morris.

129
00:07:09,812 --> 00:07:11,814
Stay off my side.

130
00:07:13,316 --> 00:07:14,267
(door buzzer)

131
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:16,002
Oh, I forgot about the Mertzes.

132
00:07:16,002 --> 00:07:17,503
What are these things doing over here

133
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:19,005
on my side?

134
00:07:29,816 --> 00:07:30,817
Come in.

135
00:07:30,817 --> 00:07:31,818
Hi, Lucy.

136
00:07:31,818 --> 00:07:32,819
Hi, folks.
Hi.

137
00:07:34,821 --> 00:07:35,822
What's this?

138
00:07:37,824 --> 00:07:41,828
Before you settle down, whose side do
you want to sit on?

139
00:07:41,828 --> 00:07:43,062
FRED: Huh?

140
00:07:43,062 --> 00:07:45,915
Over there in the neat side of the
house,

141
00:07:45,915 --> 00:07:48,301
or over here with us mess cats?

142
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:49,202
What's going on here?

143
00:07:49,202 --> 00:07:50,703
Well, Ricky and I had an argument

144
00:07:50,703 --> 00:07:52,205
about his being so messy,

145
00:07:52,205 --> 00:07:53,706
so I divided the apartment in two.

146
00:07:53,706 --> 00:07:55,208
This is my side, that's Ricky's side.

147
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:57,710
I wondered what happened over there.

148
00:07:57,710 --> 00:07:59,011
What's the matter with it?

149
00:07:59,011 --> 00:08:00,213
It looks okay to me.

150
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:01,664
Okay?

151
00:08:01,664 --> 00:08:03,349
Sure, there's nothing wrong.

152
00:08:03,349 --> 00:08:04,650
Just looks lived in.

153
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:05,635
Atta boy, Fred.

154
00:08:05,635 --> 00:08:07,386
Would you like to join me

155
00:08:07,386 --> 00:08:09,889
in the comfortable part of the house?

156
00:08:09,889 --> 00:08:10,890
Delighted.

157
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:13,626
Well, pull up some debris and sit
down, Fred.

158
00:08:13,626 --> 00:08:15,444
Don't touch anything on your way over
here.

159
00:08:15,444 --> 00:08:17,947
Everything over there is sterilized.

160
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,462
Lucy, do you mind if I sit on this
side?

161
00:08:33,462 --> 00:08:35,965
No, I think you might find it rather
pleasant over here...

162
00:08:35,965 --> 00:08:37,884
until the wind changes.

163
00:08:40,386 --> 00:08:43,122
Why don't you take your shoes off,
Fred?

164
00:08:43,122 --> 00:08:44,507
Oh, can I do that?

165
00:08:44,507 --> 00:08:45,508
Yeah.

166
00:08:45,508 --> 00:08:46,509
Oh, gee, thanks.

167
00:08:46,509 --> 00:08:48,010
Ah, what a relief.

168
00:08:48,010 --> 00:08:49,011
(chuckles)

169
00:08:49,011 --> 00:08:50,513
Take your coat off.

170
00:08:50,513 --> 00:08:52,014
Well, thanks.

171
00:08:57,019 --> 00:08:58,521
Thank you.

172
00:09:01,774 --> 00:09:03,776
Here, I'll hang it up for you.

173
00:09:03,776 --> 00:09:05,278
Ah.

174
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:08,831
Go ahead.

175
00:09:09,332 --> 00:09:10,833
Would you like some fruit?

176
00:09:10,833 --> 00:09:12,335
Yeah, I love fruit.

177
00:09:12,335 --> 00:09:13,286
All right.

178
00:09:13,286 --> 00:09:14,987
Here, Fred, have a banana.

179
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:16,622
Thanks.

180
00:09:16,622 --> 00:09:18,124
Good-looking banana.

181
00:09:23,629 --> 00:09:25,631
(phone rings)

182
00:09:25,631 --> 00:09:27,133
LUCY: Uh-uh-uh.

183
00:09:27,133 --> 00:09:28,134
It's on the line.

184
00:09:28,134 --> 00:09:29,635
We have to answer it.

185
00:09:29,635 --> 00:09:31,137
We're going to.

186
00:09:31,137 --> 00:09:32,638
Hello?

187
00:09:32,638 --> 00:09:35,141
Well, go ahead, listen to your half
and see who it is.

188
00:09:36,642 --> 00:09:38,110
Oh, it's Kenny, my press agent.

189
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:39,395
Tell him I'm plenty mad at him.

190
00:09:39,395 --> 00:09:42,898
Hello, Kenny, Ricky says to tell you
he's plenty mad at you.

191
00:09:42,898 --> 00:09:44,317
Why am I mad at you?

192
00:09:44,317 --> 00:09:45,518
Why am I mad at you?

193
00:09:45,518 --> 00:09:47,520
Huh! Because you've been promising me

194
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,922
a spread in Half Beat Note magazine

195
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:50,823
since last February.

196
00:09:50,823 --> 00:09:52,091
Splain that if you can.

197
00:09:52,491 --> 00:09:53,726
Because you've been promising me

198
00:09:54,126 --> 00:09:55,728
a spread in Half Beat magazine

199
00:09:55,728 --> 00:09:56,529
since last Febriary.

200
00:09:56,529 --> 00:09:57,964
Splain that if you can.

201
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:03,302
Oh.

202
00:10:03,302 --> 00:10:04,103
Oh.

203
00:10:04,103 --> 00:10:04,920
Oh.

204
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:05,921
I see.

205
00:10:05,921 --> 00:10:07,423
I see.

206
00:10:07,423 --> 00:10:09,241
They're gonna do the next one on me.

207
00:10:09,241 --> 00:10:11,477
Okay. Well, so long, kid, take it
easy.

208
00:10:11,477 --> 00:10:12,979
So long, kid, take a tease-y.

209
00:10:16,482 --> 00:10:19,819
If I hadn't seen it, I wouldn't
believe it.

210
00:10:19,819 --> 00:10:22,571
Well, I saw it and I still don't
believe it.

211
00:10:22,571 --> 00:10:24,073
Come on, Fred, you want some cold
beer?

212
00:10:24,073 --> 00:10:25,574
Yeah, I'd love it.

213
00:10:25,574 --> 00:10:27,576
I think I got some cold chicken

214
00:10:27,576 --> 00:10:29,078
in the icebox, too.
Come on.

215
00:10:29,078 --> 00:10:31,080
Uh-uh-uh, kitchen's on my side,
remember.

216
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:34,283
You mean I can never go into the
kitchen?

217
00:10:34,283 --> 00:10:37,787
And stand back a little, you're over
the line.

218
00:10:37,787 --> 00:10:39,789
What am I supposed to do, starve to
death?

219
00:10:39,789 --> 00:10:42,508
Oh, I'll toss you a crust of bread
now and then.

220
00:10:42,508 --> 00:10:43,709
Hungry, Ethel?

221
00:10:43,709 --> 00:10:44,677
Are you kidding?

222
00:10:44,677 --> 00:10:46,679
Come on, we'll have some beer and
cold chicken

223
00:10:46,679 --> 00:10:49,181
and we'll toss the bottles and bones

224
00:10:49,181 --> 00:10:50,182
on Ricky's side.

225
00:10:50,182 --> 00:10:51,183
Oh, say, remind me--

226
00:10:51,684 --> 00:10:53,919
I want to show you some bath salts
that I got.

227
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:54,804
They were on sale.

228
00:10:54,804 --> 00:10:56,305
Oh, show them to me now.
Okay.

229
00:10:56,305 --> 00:10:59,308
Uh-uh-uh, may I see your passport?

230
00:10:59,308 --> 00:11:01,310
I just want to show Ethel

231
00:11:01,310 --> 00:11:02,812
my new bath salts.

232
00:11:02,812 --> 00:11:04,313
Well, I'm terribly sorry,

233
00:11:04,313 --> 00:11:06,315
but the bathroom is on my side.

234
00:11:06,315 --> 00:11:07,767
(guffaws)

235
00:11:07,767 --> 00:11:10,119
Do you mean that I can never go

236
00:11:10,119 --> 00:11:11,620
into the bathroom?

237
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:12,905
That's right.

238
00:11:12,905 --> 00:11:14,407
No more taking a shower,

239
00:11:14,407 --> 00:11:15,908
no more washing your face,

240
00:11:15,908 --> 00:11:18,911
no more doing whatever it is you do
to your hair.

241
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:20,913
Well, no more food for you.

242
00:11:20,913 --> 00:11:23,416
Okay, we'll see who holds out the
longest.

243
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:26,085
Come back in a couple of weeks,
Ethel,

244
00:11:26,085 --> 00:11:27,687
we'll still be here--

245
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:30,222
a starving Cuban and a dirty
brunette.

246
00:11:41,317 --> 00:11:44,603
(playing Latin song intro)

247
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:51,610
Whenever old man trouble makes
trouble arise

248
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:54,113
Just put a big straw hat over your
eyes

249
00:11:54,613 --> 00:11:57,616
You'll never see the circumstance
making you...

250
00:11:57,616 --> 00:11:59,118
Is this a new number?

251
00:11:59,118 --> 00:12:01,120
It is, Maggie.

252
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,122
Oh, glory be, I've got to see this.

253
00:12:03,122 --> 00:12:05,524
Now, don't do it till I get seated.

254
00:12:05,524 --> 00:12:06,375
Okay.

255
00:12:06,375 --> 00:12:08,377
You know, you're my best critic.

256
00:12:08,377 --> 00:12:09,879
Are you ready?
I am.

257
00:12:09,879 --> 00:12:12,381
Whenever old man trouble

258
00:12:12,381 --> 00:12:14,884
Makes trouble arise

259
00:12:14,884 --> 00:12:17,887
Just put a big straw hat over your
eyes

260
00:12:17,887 --> 00:12:20,890
You'll never see the circumstance
making you frown

261
00:12:20,890 --> 00:12:23,893
If you just push your eyes under the
crown.

262
00:12:24,894 --> 00:12:27,396
Life can be a simple thing

263
00:12:27,396 --> 00:12:29,899
A simple thing to laugh and sing

264
00:12:29,899 --> 00:12:33,402
Get yourself a hat of straw and put
it on

265
00:12:33,886 --> 00:12:35,187
Don't take it off

266
00:12:35,187 --> 00:12:38,958
And when the landlord tells you the
rent's in arrears

267
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:40,960
A big straw hat over your ears

268
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:43,963
You'll never hear the dialogue
tragically grim

269
00:12:43,963 --> 00:12:46,966
If you just push your ear, mm!
Under the brim.

270
00:12:46,966 --> 00:12:48,968
iAgua!

271
00:12:48,968 --> 00:12:50,970
iArriba!

272
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:52,471
Yeah!

273
00:12:52,471 --> 00:13:01,230
(trumpet and clave solo)

274
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:03,232
Very good, Maggie.

275
00:13:04,233 --> 00:13:07,019
(band resumes playing)

276
00:13:15,027 --> 00:13:16,028
Hey!

277
00:13:18,531 --> 00:13:19,932
Hey!

278
00:13:19,932 --> 00:13:21,283
Very good!

279
00:13:21,283 --> 00:13:22,284
(squealing)

280
00:13:22,284 --> 00:13:23,285
Yeah!

281
00:13:28,290 --> 00:13:34,480
Oh... life can be a simple thing

282
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,465
A simple thing

283
00:13:36,465 --> 00:13:39,318
To laugh and sing

284
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:43,472
Get yourself a hat of straw

285
00:13:43,472 --> 00:13:44,974
Put it on...

286
00:13:47,476 --> 00:13:49,195
Don't take it off...

287
00:13:49,195 --> 00:13:50,029
No.

288
00:13:50,029 --> 00:13:54,783
(harp solo)

289
00:13:54,783 --> 00:13:58,287
And... pretty soon

290
00:13:58,287 --> 00:14:00,789
Your troubles will come to an end

291
00:14:00,789 --> 00:14:02,791
Because you will not see

292
00:14:02,791 --> 00:14:04,293
Or hear it, my friend

293
00:14:04,293 --> 00:14:07,796
To visualize permanent sun in the
skies

294
00:14:07,796 --> 00:14:09,798
A big... straw...

295
00:14:09,798 --> 00:14:11,300
Hat... down...

296
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:14,803
A big straw hat down over your eyes.

297
00:14:14,803 --> 00:14:16,305
Yeah!

298
00:14:18,307 --> 00:14:21,310
(applause)

299
00:14:22,811 --> 00:14:24,313
Well?

300
00:14:24,313 --> 00:14:27,066
Oh, that's wonderful.

301
00:14:27,066 --> 00:14:29,568
Oh, thank you, Maggie, thank you very
much.

302
00:14:29,568 --> 00:14:32,071
I'm sure the pleasure was all mine.

303
00:14:32,071 --> 00:14:33,072
Oh, that's it.

304
00:14:33,072 --> 00:14:34,857
All right, fellows.

305
00:14:34,857 --> 00:14:36,859
All right, take ten.

306
00:14:36,859 --> 00:14:38,360
Take ten.

307
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:42,364
And I mean ten, not half an hour.

308
00:14:43,365 --> 00:14:44,366
Hi, Rick.

309
00:14:44,366 --> 00:14:45,367
Hi, Kenny.

310
00:14:45,367 --> 00:14:46,869
How is this for fast action?

311
00:14:46,869 --> 00:14:47,870
I promised you last night

312
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:49,872
you were going to get the next
magazine spread.

313
00:14:49,872 --> 00:14:52,391
Meet the photographer who's going to
shoot it, Jim White.

314
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:53,709
Hello, Jim.

315
00:14:53,709 --> 00:14:55,210
Hello, Ricky.

316
00:14:55,210 --> 00:14:56,712
I'd like to shoot those pictures
tonight.

317
00:14:56,712 --> 00:14:58,213
All right, I think tonight will be
wonderful.

318
00:14:58,213 --> 00:14:59,965
You should get very good stuff here
tonight.

319
00:14:59,965 --> 00:15:01,467
Yeah, and I'll tell you something
else

320
00:15:01,467 --> 00:15:02,368
I'd like to do, Ricky--

321
00:15:02,368 --> 00:15:03,969
some pictures of your home life.

322
00:15:03,969 --> 00:15:04,770
Oh, sure.

323
00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:06,605
What kind of a place have you got?

324
00:15:06,605 --> 00:15:07,940
Well, I have a little apartment

325
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:09,692
in a reconverted brownstone.

326
00:15:09,692 --> 00:15:12,478
Say, I'd better call the wife and
tell her you're coming.

327
00:15:12,478 --> 00:15:13,946
Give her a little warning, eh?

328
00:15:15,731 --> 00:15:17,483
Well, to tell you the truth, James,

329
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:19,551
she doesn't need any warning.

330
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:22,454
She's the best little housekeeper you
ever saw.

331
00:15:22,454 --> 00:15:25,040
Everything is always as neat as a
pin.

332
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,041
Well, we got to go.

333
00:15:26,041 --> 00:15:27,326
Jim'll meet you here after rehearsal

334
00:15:27,326 --> 00:15:28,994
you can take him out to the house.

335
00:15:28,994 --> 00:15:29,995
Okay, I'll see you then.

336
00:15:29,995 --> 00:15:30,996
Fine.
Bye.

337
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:42,074
Oh, you don't say, Marge, is that so?

338
00:15:42,074 --> 00:15:43,275
Really?

339
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:45,010
Well, it's certainly good

340
00:15:45,010 --> 00:15:48,013
to get the other side of the story
for a change.

341
00:15:48,013 --> 00:15:51,016
Hey, do you know we've been gabbing
for 45 minutes?

342
00:15:51,016 --> 00:15:53,886
Yeah, well, let's get together next
week

343
00:15:53,886 --> 00:15:55,270
and have a real talk.

344
00:15:55,270 --> 00:15:56,772
Okay, dear, bye.

345
00:15:56,772 --> 00:15:57,773
Hi.

346
00:15:57,773 --> 00:15:58,774
Oh, hi, Ethel.

347
00:15:58,774 --> 00:15:59,775
Welcome to tobacco road.

348
00:15:59,775 --> 00:16:01,760
How did Ricky get out of the house
this morning

349
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:02,962
without crossing the line?

350
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:04,196
Through the bedroom window?

351
00:16:04,196 --> 00:16:05,914
No, he used the back door.

352
00:16:05,914 --> 00:16:07,933
We made a deal: I swapped him kitchen
privileges

353
00:16:07,933 --> 00:16:09,168
for bathroom rights.

354
00:16:11,303 --> 00:16:12,788
Lucy, how long can this go on?

355
00:16:12,788 --> 00:16:13,789
Oh, it's over now.

356
00:16:13,789 --> 00:16:14,790
I'm going to clean up

357
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:16,792
the whole house this afternoon.

358
00:16:16,792 --> 00:16:17,793
Well, thank goodness.

359
00:16:17,793 --> 00:16:18,794
Oh, I forgot what I came up for.

360
00:16:18,794 --> 00:16:20,796
Ricky just called me.
Your line was busy.

361
00:16:20,796 --> 00:16:22,297
What'd he want?

362
00:16:22,297 --> 00:16:23,298
He said to tell you he's bringing

363
00:16:23,298 --> 00:16:25,801
a magazine photographer home tonight
to take some pictures,

364
00:16:25,801 --> 00:16:28,804
and he wants you to clean up the
house perfectly-- all of it.

365
00:16:28,804 --> 00:16:30,305
Oh, he won't keep it clean for me,

366
00:16:30,806 --> 00:16:32,307
but when it's important for him,

367
00:16:32,307 --> 00:16:34,810
he wants the whole house cleaned up
perfectly-- all of it.

368
00:16:34,810 --> 00:16:36,311
Let's face it, he's a man.

369
00:16:36,311 --> 00:16:37,963
Serve him right if I left it

370
00:16:37,963 --> 00:16:39,164
just the way it is.

371
00:16:39,164 --> 00:16:40,432
Yeah.

372
00:16:40,432 --> 00:16:41,633
Hey, I'll do it.

373
00:16:41,633 --> 00:16:43,068
Oh, Lucy, you wouldn't.

374
00:16:43,068 --> 00:16:44,570
Yes, I would.

375
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:45,571
What about that photographer?

376
00:16:45,571 --> 00:16:47,072
Oh, that doesn't matter.

377
00:16:47,072 --> 00:16:48,874
It's just for that silly musician's
magazine.

378
00:16:48,874 --> 00:16:50,292
Nobody ever reads it anyway.

379
00:16:50,292 --> 00:16:51,293
And as soon as I make my point

380
00:16:51,794 --> 00:16:52,644
I'll tell him it's a gag.

381
00:16:52,644 --> 00:16:54,046
(laughs)

382
00:16:54,046 --> 00:16:56,749
And as long as it's a gag, I might as
well go whole hog.

383
00:16:56,749 --> 00:16:57,549
Ethel, will you help me?

384
00:16:57,549 --> 00:16:59,001
Sure, what do you want me to do?

385
00:16:59,001 --> 00:17:01,503
Well, listen, when Ricky comes home
with that photographer,

386
00:17:01,503 --> 00:17:03,005
we'll have the whole place...

387
00:17:09,561 --> 00:17:11,814
Well, here we are, Jim...

388
00:17:20,823 --> 00:17:22,508
What's all this?

389
00:17:22,508 --> 00:17:24,693
Is this your apartment?

390
00:17:24,693 --> 00:17:27,279
Well, it sure doesn't look anything
like the...

391
00:17:27,279 --> 00:17:28,530
(clanging)

392
00:17:32,034 --> 00:17:33,535
Well, what do you know, Jim?

393
00:17:33,535 --> 00:17:35,788
We got into the wrong apartment after
all.

394
00:17:35,788 --> 00:17:36,789
Let's get out of here.

395
00:17:36,789 --> 00:17:39,291
Hi, Ricky honey.

396
00:17:55,974 --> 00:17:57,476
Say...

397
00:17:58,977 --> 00:18:00,479
Say!

398
00:18:00,479 --> 00:18:01,480
What gives here?

399
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:03,482
Do you know who this is?

400
00:18:03,482 --> 00:18:06,485
I don't even know what it is.

401
00:18:07,986 --> 00:18:10,489
Get me a stick and I'll kill it.

402
00:18:10,489 --> 00:18:14,893
(as hillbilly): Aren't you going to
introduce your bitty, bitty bride?

403
00:18:15,794 --> 00:18:17,296
Lucy, I swear...

404
00:18:17,296 --> 00:18:18,797
Is this your wife?

405
00:18:18,797 --> 00:18:21,100
Why, sure!

406
00:18:25,387 --> 00:18:26,889
Yes, Jim.

407
00:18:26,889 --> 00:18:28,390
This is my wife.

408
00:18:28,390 --> 00:18:29,892
Lucy, meet Jim White.

409
00:18:29,892 --> 00:18:31,894
Pleased to meet ya.

410
00:18:31,894 --> 00:18:34,246
Whoa! I got an itch.

411
00:18:41,019 --> 00:18:43,822
(groans): Ah...

412
00:18:43,822 --> 00:18:45,324
Lucy...

413
00:18:45,324 --> 00:18:47,326
Lucy, whatever you're up to, cut it
out.

414
00:18:47,326 --> 00:18:48,327
What's the matter?

415
00:18:48,327 --> 00:18:49,328
What's the matter?

416
00:18:49,328 --> 00:18:50,829
Look at the way this place looks!

417
00:18:50,829 --> 00:18:52,831
Yeah, it looks pretty good, don't it?

418
00:18:52,831 --> 00:18:55,834
You should have seen it 'fore I
cleaned it up.

419
00:18:59,087 --> 00:19:00,589
It's a regular pigpen!

420
00:19:00,589 --> 00:19:04,092
Oh, it ain't a regular one, but it'll
do.

421
00:19:05,594 --> 00:19:08,096
You know we don't keep pigs in here--

422
00:19:08,096 --> 00:19:09,598
just chickens!

423
00:19:09,598 --> 00:19:11,099
Jim, Jim, please, please.

424
00:19:11,099 --> 00:19:13,602
Please, Jim, now, look, believe me

425
00:19:13,602 --> 00:19:16,104
this place has never looked like this
before in my whole life

426
00:19:16,104 --> 00:19:18,607
and... and there isn't a chicken

427
00:19:18,607 --> 00:19:19,992
within ten miles of here!

428
00:19:21,393 --> 00:19:25,397
Boy, she's flying high tonight, ain't
she!

429
00:19:25,397 --> 00:19:26,899
Oh, Lucy, Lucy...

430
00:19:26,899 --> 00:19:28,400
Lucy, please, Lucy,

431
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,402
come on, let's clean it up.

432
00:19:30,402 --> 00:19:34,406
Here, chick, chick, chick, chick,
chick, chick.

433
00:19:34,406 --> 00:19:35,908
Honey...

434
00:19:35,908 --> 00:19:37,409
honey, do you realize

435
00:19:37,409 --> 00:19:40,412
that this man is a very important
photographer?

436
00:19:40,412 --> 00:19:41,914
Oh, boy! Take my picture,

437
00:19:42,414 --> 00:19:43,415
will ya, sonny?

438
00:19:43,415 --> 00:19:45,384
I'd be glad to.

439
00:19:45,384 --> 00:19:48,220
Oh, wait a minute, I got to comb my
hair.

440
00:19:52,507 --> 00:19:53,508
There we are.

441
00:19:53,508 --> 00:19:55,010
Ha-ha!

442
00:19:55,010 --> 00:19:55,961
Yeah, boy.

443
00:19:55,961 --> 00:19:57,312
Oh, no.

444
00:19:57,312 --> 00:19:58,313
Ay!

445
00:19:58,313 --> 00:19:59,314
Ah...

446
00:19:59,815 --> 00:20:01,316
Oh, my god.

447
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:07,606
Ha, it's messy, ain't it?

448
00:20:08,607 --> 00:20:11,360
I got to see if my clothes are dry.

449
00:20:12,611 --> 00:20:13,812
(Ethel screams)

450
00:20:13,812 --> 00:20:15,013
(screams)

451
00:20:16,448 --> 00:20:18,450
Grandma!

452
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:21,887
You been hangin' there all day?

453
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:22,688
Yep.

454
00:20:22,688 --> 00:20:24,039
Must have been quite a trip

455
00:20:24,039 --> 00:20:25,507
coming through the washing machine.

456
00:20:25,507 --> 00:20:27,292
I didn't mind the washing machine,

457
00:20:27,292 --> 00:20:30,796
but I durn near passed out comin'
through the wringer.

458
00:20:32,514 --> 00:20:35,017
Well, come on, grandma, we're goin'
huntin'.

459
00:20:35,017 --> 00:20:36,518
Gotta bag our supper.

460
00:20:36,518 --> 00:20:37,519
Huntin'? Huntin'!

461
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:39,521
(whoops)

462
00:20:39,521 --> 00:20:41,023
Get ready, get ready, get ready

463
00:20:41,523 --> 00:20:42,524
A-huntin' we will go

464
00:20:43,025 --> 00:20:44,526
A-huntin' we will go

465
00:20:44,526 --> 00:20:46,178
Hi-ho dee-da-dee-die

466
00:20:46,178 --> 00:20:47,846
A-huntin' we will go.

467
00:20:47,846 --> 00:20:49,681
A-huntin' we will go

468
00:20:49,681 --> 00:20:51,984
A-huntin' we will go...

469
00:21:00,709 --> 00:21:02,210
Jim, please believe me--

470
00:21:02,210 --> 00:21:03,996
I don't know what's going on here.

471
00:21:03,996 --> 00:21:06,498
I've seen her do strange things
before

472
00:21:06,498 --> 00:21:09,968
but this time I think she really
snapped her cap.

473
00:21:09,968 --> 00:21:11,470
She says she's going hunting.

474
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:12,971
Hunting.
Hunting in the bedroom.

475
00:21:12,971 --> 00:21:13,972
How do you like that.

476
00:21:13,972 --> 00:21:15,807
That's the most ridiculous thing...

477
00:21:15,807 --> 00:21:17,059
(gunshots)

478
00:21:17,059 --> 00:21:18,910
What is that?!

479
00:21:18,910 --> 00:21:20,345
(exclaiming)

480
00:21:20,345 --> 00:21:23,982
A-hunting we will go, a-hunting we
will go

481
00:21:23,982 --> 00:21:26,485
And a-hunting we will go.

482
00:21:29,821 --> 00:21:31,423
ETHEL: Whew!

483
00:21:31,423 --> 00:21:34,609
(ululating like Tarzan)

484
00:21:40,282 --> 00:21:43,835
This ought to give your musician
fellers a laugh, huh?

485
00:21:43,835 --> 00:21:46,038
What do you mean, musician fellows?

486
00:21:46,038 --> 00:21:48,757
Well, who else reads your durn
magazine but musician fellers?

487
00:21:48,757 --> 00:21:50,258
Yeah.

488
00:21:50,258 --> 00:21:51,076
Lucy...

489
00:21:51,076 --> 00:21:52,277
Huh?

490
00:21:52,277 --> 00:21:54,713
This man is not from Half Beat
magazine.

491
00:21:54,713 --> 00:21:55,714
He ain't?

492
00:21:55,714 --> 00:21:56,715
No, I'm from

493
00:21:56,715 --> 00:21:57,716
Look magazine.

494
00:21:57,716 --> 00:22:00,218
Ewwwww...

495
00:22:05,357 --> 00:22:07,726
(sobbing)

496
00:22:07,726 --> 00:22:08,727
Hi, Lucy.

497
00:22:08,727 --> 00:22:10,228
(crying)

498
00:22:10,228 --> 00:22:11,730
Honey, what's the matter?

499
00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:14,783
Look magazine came out today.

500
00:22:14,783 --> 00:22:16,785
Oh, did they do the spread on me?

501
00:22:16,785 --> 00:22:17,786
How did it look?

502
00:22:17,786 --> 00:22:19,788
Oh, it was wonderful for you.

503
00:22:19,788 --> 00:22:22,290
They showed the nightclub and the
band

504
00:22:22,290 --> 00:22:23,792
and the shots of you singing.

505
00:22:23,792 --> 00:22:25,293
(wails)

506
00:22:25,293 --> 00:22:26,795
Oh, honey, what are you crying about?

507
00:22:26,795 --> 00:22:27,796
Jim White promised me

508
00:22:27,796 --> 00:22:29,798
he wouldn't use a single picture of
you

509
00:22:29,798 --> 00:22:30,799
in the article.

510
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:33,969
No, I wasn't in the article.

511
00:22:33,969 --> 00:22:35,971
I made the cover.

I'm home!

Lucy!

Where are you?

00:00:35,835 --> 00:00:37,837
I'm right here, dear.

00:00:42,909 --> 00:00:45,678
Lucy, how you've changed!

9
00:00:46,913 --> 00:00:50,050
Yes, it's a new way I'm doing my
hair.

10
00:00:51,651 --> 00:00:53,520
Where is she, Fred?

11
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:54,854
She's gone to market.

12
00:00:54,854 --> 00:00:56,456
Oh, well, I'm glad to see

13
00:00:56,456 --> 00:00:58,858
that you're finally fixing that
drain.

14
00:00:58,858 --> 00:01:00,060
What do you mean, finally?

15
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:02,345
When was the first time you told me
this drain leaked?

16
00:01:02,345 --> 00:01:07,567
The day after we moved here-- August
6, 1948.

17
00:01:07,567 --> 00:01:11,688
That's right, and that's pretty good
service for my building.

00:01:11,688 --> 00:01:14,107
Fred, aren't you finished with that
drain yet?

19
00:01:14,107 --> 00:01:14,908
Not quite.

20
00:01:14,908 --> 00:01:16,509
Well, come on downstairs-- dinner's
ready.

21
00:01:16,509 --> 00:01:18,711
Stop ordering me around, will you?

22
00:01:18,711 --> 00:01:20,029
Now, listen, Fred Mertz...

23
00:01:20,029 --> 00:01:21,030
Come here.
Come in, Ethel.

24
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:23,032
I want to show you something.

25
00:01:23,032 --> 00:01:24,033
Come in here.

26
00:01:24,033 --> 00:01:25,034
You, too, curly.

27
00:01:25,034 --> 00:01:28,037
FRED: All right, all right.

28
00:01:30,023 --> 00:01:32,342
(gasps)

29
00:01:32,342 --> 00:01:33,843
Oh, a mink coat!

30
00:01:33,843 --> 00:01:38,631
Oh, Ricky, Lucy will just go out of
her mind!

31
00:01:38,631 --> 00:01:40,133
I ought to slug you.

32
00:01:40,133 --> 00:01:42,168
What are you trying to do--

33
00:01:42,168 --> 00:01:43,770
make a bum out of me?

34
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:45,371
Don't blame that on him.

35
00:01:45,371 --> 00:01:47,774
You were a bum before he was born.

36
00:01:47,774 --> 00:01:49,075
Oh, yeah?

37
00:01:49,075 --> 00:01:49,893
Yeah!

38
00:01:49,893 --> 00:01:51,144
Hold it, hold it!

39
00:01:51,144 --> 00:01:53,029
This coat is not for Lucy.

40
00:01:53,029 --> 00:01:54,030
It isn't?

41
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:55,315
No.

42
00:01:55,315 --> 00:01:56,316
Saved by the bell.

43
00:01:56,316 --> 00:01:57,317
I just rented it.

44
00:01:57,317 --> 00:01:59,285
One of the girls is going to wear it

45
00:01:59,285 --> 00:02:01,287
in a dance number down at the club.

46
00:02:01,287 --> 00:02:02,238
Oh.

47
00:02:02,238 --> 00:02:04,040
Well, don't show it to Lucy.

48
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:07,043
You know how she's always wanted a
mink coat.

49
00:02:07,043 --> 00:02:09,546
Yeah, I know, but she can't have this
one.

50
00:02:09,546 --> 00:02:11,698
You know how much this thing costs?

51
00:02:11,698 --> 00:02:12,899
3,500 bucks.

52
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:16,136
I may faint!

53
00:02:17,637 --> 00:02:18,471
Ricky?

54
00:02:18,471 --> 00:02:19,422
Yes?

55
00:02:19,422 --> 00:02:21,341
Could I play like it's mine,

56
00:02:21,341 --> 00:02:22,942
just for a little while?

57
00:02:22,942 --> 00:02:24,344
Sure, come here, put it on.

58
00:02:24,344 --> 00:02:25,845
Oh!

59
00:02:26,846 --> 00:02:27,847
Ooh!

60
00:02:27,847 --> 00:02:30,350
Be careful, now.

61
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:31,851
Don't wrinkle it.

62
00:02:31,851 --> 00:02:33,353
I won't.

63
00:02:35,855 --> 00:02:37,357
And don't get attached to it,

64
00:02:37,857 --> 00:02:39,092
Miss Minnie Mink.

65
00:02:40,293 --> 00:02:42,295
Oh, I can dream, can't I?

66
00:02:42,295 --> 00:02:43,780
Hi, everybody!

67
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:45,281
ALL: Hi!

68
00:02:45,281 --> 00:02:47,534
Ethel, a mink coat!

69
00:02:47,534 --> 00:02:50,537
When did you get it?

70
00:02:50,537 --> 00:02:52,539
Uh...

71
00:02:54,207 --> 00:02:55,458
Just now.

72
00:02:55,458 --> 00:02:56,960
But from whom?

73
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:57,961
Him.

74
00:02:57,961 --> 00:02:59,462
Fred!

75
00:03:04,717 --> 00:03:08,972
Oh, uh, wasn't that generous of old
fat Fred?

76
00:03:08,972 --> 00:03:10,473
Oh, my goodness, yes!

77
00:03:10,473 --> 00:03:11,975
What was the occasion, Fred?

78
00:03:11,975 --> 00:03:14,928
Oh, I just thought it was about time
to buy the old battle-ax...

79
00:03:14,928 --> 00:03:16,930
the-the little woman a trinket of
some kind,

80
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:19,332
so I picked up that bunch of skins.

81
00:03:19,332 --> 00:03:20,984
Oh, bunch of skins.

82
00:03:20,984 --> 00:03:21,985
Isn't he wonderful?

83
00:03:21,985 --> 00:03:25,488
Oh, Ethel you look so beautiful and
so glamorous.

84
00:03:25,488 --> 00:03:27,991
Honey, look, I got something to tell
you.

85
00:03:27,991 --> 00:03:30,960
Don't talk to me, you tightwad!

86
00:03:32,462 --> 00:03:33,463
Lucy!

87
00:03:33,947 --> 00:03:36,015
It's a pity you couldn't buy me a
coat

88
00:03:36,416 --> 00:03:37,834
if he could buy one for her.

89
00:03:37,834 --> 00:03:39,836
How can you stand there and laugh

90
00:03:40,336 --> 00:03:41,337
when I feel so awful?

91
00:03:41,337 --> 00:03:43,273
You know I've always wanted a mink
coat,

92
00:03:43,273 --> 00:03:46,142
and now she...
(sobs) she...

93
00:03:46,142 --> 00:03:49,646
(wailing)

94
00:03:49,646 --> 00:03:50,647
Oh, Lucy!

95
00:03:51,147 --> 00:03:52,799
(door slams, Lucy crying)

96
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:54,684
Oh, I'm sorry, Ricky.

97
00:03:54,684 --> 00:03:56,686
That's all right, Ethel.

98
00:03:56,686 --> 00:03:58,187
I'll straighten it out.

99
00:03:58,187 --> 00:03:59,689
(chuckling)

100
00:03:59,689 --> 00:04:01,691
Lucy!

101
00:04:01,691 --> 00:04:02,692
(crying)

102
00:04:02,692 --> 00:04:04,193
Honey! Honey, don't cry.

103
00:04:04,193 --> 00:04:05,194
Let me explain.

104
00:04:05,194 --> 00:04:06,195
Don't bother.

105
00:04:06,195 --> 00:04:08,698
Oh, honey, I'm trying to tell you

106
00:04:08,698 --> 00:04:10,516
that coat doesn't belong to Ethel.

107
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:11,718
It's all right.

108
00:04:11,718 --> 00:04:14,087
I can wear this ratty old cloth coat

109
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:15,588
for another four...

110
00:04:15,588 --> 00:04:16,389
It doesn't?

111
00:04:16,789 --> 00:04:18,291
No, I brought the coat home.

112
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:20,293
Ethel was just trying it on.

113
00:04:20,293 --> 00:04:23,179
Oh, honey, you big, wonderful
husband.

114
00:04:23,179 --> 00:04:24,180
Wait, wait!

115
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:26,683
Honey, you don't understand, honey!

116
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:28,184
Yes, I do understand.

117
00:04:28,184 --> 00:04:31,187
You were just making a big joke with
me.

118
00:04:31,187 --> 00:04:32,188
Now, honey...

119
00:04:32,188 --> 00:04:33,189
Where's my coat?

120
00:04:33,189 --> 00:04:34,607
Where's my coat?

121
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:36,943
It's mine.

122
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:39,445
Oh, it's mine, Ethel!

123
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:41,948
Oh, isn't it beautiful?

124
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:42,949
It's just dreamy.

125
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:43,950
Honey, honey, wait.

126
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:45,451
Before you get too excited, honey,

127
00:04:45,451 --> 00:04:47,453
it's something I have to tell you.

128
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:48,454
What?

129
00:04:48,454 --> 00:04:49,455
Well, honey, you see...

130
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:51,958
You know what's wonderful about this
present, Ricky?

131
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:53,459
You didn't forget our anniversary.

132
00:04:57,697 --> 00:04:58,581
Well, look, honey, I...

133
00:04:58,581 --> 00:05:00,083
It's the most perfect present.

134
00:05:00,083 --> 00:05:02,585
How did you know it was just what I
wanted, honey?

135
00:05:02,585 --> 00:05:07,590
Well, honey, you see, what I was... I
only...

136
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:10,593
I had a hunch you'd like it.

137
00:05:10,593 --> 00:05:12,595
Oh, you had a hunch.

138
00:05:12,595 --> 00:05:17,400
And you two sly ones in on the joke
all the time.

139
00:05:20,253 --> 00:05:21,087
Yeah.

140
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:22,288
Happy anniversary.

141
00:05:22,288 --> 00:05:23,489
Thank you!

142
00:05:23,489 --> 00:05:25,491
Ricky, I'm so in love with this coat

143
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:27,493
that I'm never going to take it off.

144
00:05:27,493 --> 00:05:28,945
Never, never, never!

145
00:05:28,945 --> 00:05:31,297
Come on, Ethel, let's see how I look
in the full-length mirror.

146
00:05:31,297 --> 00:05:32,248
Come on!

147
00:05:32,248 --> 00:05:33,750
Okay.

148
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:36,252
Come on, already!

149
00:05:36,252 --> 00:05:37,253
All right.

150
00:05:38,254 --> 00:05:40,540
Why didn't you tell her the truth?

151
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:42,041
If I tell her the truth

152
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:44,377
it'd get me in worse hot water--

153
00:05:44,377 --> 00:05:46,179
forgetting our anniversary.

154
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:48,848
I should have brought her something.

155
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:51,250
You brought her something now,
brother.

156
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:52,452
She can't keep it.

157
00:05:52,452 --> 00:05:54,454
I got to get it back somehow.

158
00:05:54,454 --> 00:05:56,856
How? She's never going to take it
off!

159
00:05:56,856 --> 00:05:58,091
"Never, never, never!"

160
00:06:01,327 --> 00:06:05,198
She's got to take it off when she
goes to bed.

161
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:08,701
Hey! I'll sneak it away during the
night.

162
00:06:08,701 --> 00:06:12,905
I'll open a few drawers, mess things
up a little bit

163
00:06:12,905 --> 00:06:16,659
and I'll tell her it was stolen by a
burglar.

164
00:06:16,659 --> 00:06:17,944
(chortles)

165
00:06:17,944 --> 00:06:19,829
Hey, you got something up there.

166
00:06:19,829 --> 00:06:22,682
How'd you ever get an idea like that?

167
00:06:22,682 --> 00:06:25,001
It's easy-- I think of it in Spanish

168
00:06:25,001 --> 00:06:27,420
and then I translate it into English.

169
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:34,527
(door opens)

170
00:06:34,527 --> 00:06:35,728
(fakes snoring)

171
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:48,978
Wh-what happened?

172
00:08:48,978 --> 00:08:50,780
Nothing, honey.

173
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:52,281
Go back to sleep.

174
00:09:05,678 --> 00:09:06,629
Lucy!

175
00:09:06,629 --> 00:09:07,630
Yes?

176
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:08,631
What are you doing?

177
00:09:09,115 --> 00:09:10,716
Washing dishes.

178
00:09:10,716 --> 00:09:12,385
Washing dishes!

179
00:09:38,778 --> 00:09:40,413
Ricky, anything wrong, dear?

180
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:43,282
Wrong?
Oh, no, honey, no.

181
00:09:43,282 --> 00:09:44,283
Good.

182
00:09:44,283 --> 00:09:44,784
No, there's nothing wrong.

183
00:09:44,784 --> 00:09:45,785
I'm going in and get dressed.

184
00:09:45,785 --> 00:09:46,786
I want to go downtown

185
00:09:46,786 --> 00:09:47,787
to show my coat off to everybody.

186
00:09:47,787 --> 00:09:48,788
All right.

187
00:09:48,788 --> 00:09:50,089
Lucy...

188
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:51,290
You see, it's not for me.

189
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:53,626
It's just that I want everybody to
realize

190
00:09:53,626 --> 00:09:55,928
what a wonderful, wonderful husband I
have.

191
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:01,734
Anybody home?

192
00:10:01,734 --> 00:10:03,336
Come in, Fred.

193
00:10:05,771 --> 00:10:07,506
I gather from the look on your face

194
00:10:07,506 --> 00:10:09,942
that Lucy is still attached to that
coat.

195
00:10:09,942 --> 00:10:13,846
I'm beginning to think that the coat
is attached to Lucy.

196
00:10:13,846 --> 00:10:15,982
I don't know what to do, Fred.

197
00:10:15,982 --> 00:10:17,483
The show is tomorrow.

198
00:10:17,483 --> 00:10:20,219
I got to get that coat back tonight
or else.

199
00:10:20,219 --> 00:10:22,288
Well, you got any ideas?

200
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:23,289
No.

201
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:26,459
But there must be some way.

202
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:54,520
I got it!

203
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:55,921
What?
It's simple!

204
00:10:55,921 --> 00:10:59,075
Just tell her there was an epidemic
of sick minks last year

205
00:10:59,075 --> 00:11:02,461
and one of the bad skins slipped past
the fur inspector.

206
00:11:02,461 --> 00:11:03,696
What?
Sure.

207
00:11:03,696 --> 00:11:04,897
And you have to have that coat
fumigated.

208
00:11:05,297 --> 00:11:06,699
Otherwise, she might break out with

209
00:11:06,699 --> 00:11:09,402
a very bad case of mink pox.

210
00:11:12,471 --> 00:11:14,206
Mink's pox?

211
00:11:14,206 --> 00:11:17,476
Yeah, and it sounds even worse with
your accent.

212
00:11:17,476 --> 00:11:19,478
Now look, Fred, never mind, I don't
like that.

213
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:22,682
Look, you remember the idea I had
about the burglar?

214
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:23,883
Yeah.

215
00:11:23,883 --> 00:11:26,385
All right, the burglar is going to
show up tonight.

216
00:11:26,852 --> 00:11:27,353
What?

217
00:11:27,853 --> 00:11:29,355
Tonight when we sound sleep,

218
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:31,807
a phony burglar is going to come in
here

219
00:11:32,308 --> 00:11:35,027
and demand that coat at the point of
a gun.

220
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:35,861
Hey, that's wonderful!

221
00:11:36,295 --> 00:11:38,064
Besides, there's been a burglar scare

222
00:11:38,064 --> 00:11:39,265
in the neighborhood lately.

223
00:11:39,265 --> 00:11:40,866
Yeah, that's what gave me the idea.

224
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:42,201
Do you suppose she'll think he's a
phony?

225
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:44,487
Not if you cover your face with a
mask.

226
00:11:44,487 --> 00:11:45,955
That's a good idea.

227
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:46,872
Hey, wait a minute, now.

228
00:11:46,872 --> 00:11:49,075
I draw the line at prowling around

229
00:11:49,075 --> 00:11:52,011
in other people's apartments in the
middle of the night.

230
00:11:52,011 --> 00:11:53,746
Now, look, Fred.

231
00:11:53,746 --> 00:11:56,148
Uh... let's look at it this way.

232
00:11:56,148 --> 00:11:59,568
If you don't do it, Lucy will keep
the coat.

233
00:11:59,568 --> 00:12:00,886
Yeah.

234
00:12:00,886 --> 00:12:02,138
Now, Ethel wants

235
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:03,823
everything that Lucy gets.

236
00:12:03,823 --> 00:12:04,724
Yeah.

237
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:06,225
So pretty soon,

238
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:08,227
you will have to buy Ethel...

239
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:12,298
All right, what time do you want me
to break in?

240
00:12:42,962 --> 00:12:44,163
(door opens)

241
00:13:23,235 --> 00:13:27,273
(rattling of drawers)

242
00:14:00,005 --> 00:14:01,006
Hey, what kept you?

243
00:14:01,006 --> 00:14:02,007
You're late.

244
00:14:02,007 --> 00:14:03,509
Stick them up!

245
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:04,376
Ouch!

246
00:14:04,376 --> 00:14:05,594
What are you doing with that thing?

247
00:14:05,594 --> 00:14:07,096
Come on, let's wake her up.

248
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:08,097
I said stick them up!

249
00:14:08,597 --> 00:14:10,599
Stop fooling around with that gun.

250
00:14:10,599 --> 00:14:12,601
Why do you have to ham it up

251
00:14:12,601 --> 00:14:14,303
all over the joint all the time?

252
00:14:14,303 --> 00:14:15,804
Come on.

253
00:14:20,609 --> 00:14:23,112
Now, listen, you stay right here

254
00:14:23,112 --> 00:14:24,797
until I wake her up.

255
00:14:24,797 --> 00:14:26,031
Shh.

256
00:14:30,035 --> 00:14:31,036
Lucy!
What?

257
00:14:31,036 --> 00:14:32,037
Lucy!
What?

258
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:33,539
I got a feeling there's somebody else

259
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:34,773
in this room besides us.

260
00:14:34,773 --> 00:14:35,624
Really?
Yeah.

261
00:14:37,076 --> 00:14:38,577
(screaming)

262
00:14:41,747 --> 00:14:44,583
Hands up and keep them up!

263
00:14:48,087 --> 00:14:49,822
What's in this box?

264
00:14:49,822 --> 00:14:51,140
Please, Mr. Burglar,

265
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:53,459
take our money, take our jewels

266
00:14:53,459 --> 00:14:56,061
but don't take my wife's mink coat.

267
00:14:56,061 --> 00:14:58,130
It's worth 3,500 bucks... oh!

268
00:14:58,130 --> 00:15:00,065
Is that real mink?

269
00:15:00,065 --> 00:15:02,534
No, no, it's mink-dyed imitation
skunk.

270
00:15:02,534 --> 00:15:04,853
Eww! Smells awful, you wouldn't want
it.

271
00:15:04,853 --> 00:15:05,854
Hand it over.

272
00:15:05,854 --> 00:15:06,855
No, no, no!

273
00:15:06,855 --> 00:15:07,856
No, no!

274
00:15:07,856 --> 00:15:08,857
Hand me that coat.

275
00:15:08,857 --> 00:15:09,858
No, you can't have it.

276
00:15:09,858 --> 00:15:10,859
No!

277
00:15:10,859 --> 00:15:11,860
Give me that coat.

278
00:15:12,361 --> 00:15:12,861
No!

279
00:15:13,362 --> 00:15:14,363
Lady!

280
00:15:16,665 --> 00:15:18,634
Hand over that coat or I'll shoot.

281
00:15:18,634 --> 00:15:19,885
Wait a minute.

282
00:15:20,286 --> 00:15:22,221
Okay, go ahead and shoot.

283
00:15:27,026 --> 00:15:29,678
Look, lady, I don't want to get
nasty.

284
00:15:29,678 --> 00:15:30,896
Hand me that coat.

285
00:15:30,896 --> 00:15:32,498
No! Ricky, do something.

286
00:15:32,498 --> 00:15:33,465
All right, honey.

287
00:15:33,966 --> 00:15:36,468
Listen, you, are you really going to
shoot us

288
00:15:36,969 --> 00:15:38,971
if we don't give you this coat?

289
00:15:38,971 --> 00:15:40,306
Yeah.

290
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:46,278
(screams)

291
00:15:46,278 --> 00:15:48,063
My hero!

292
00:15:48,063 --> 00:15:51,016
Honey, your life is worth much more
to me

293
00:15:51,016 --> 00:15:52,618
than a hunk of fur.

294
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:53,419
(rattling)

295
00:15:53,419 --> 00:15:55,621
What's that?

296
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:56,622
A ladder!

297
00:15:56,622 --> 00:15:59,491
Hey, there's something screwy about
this joint.

298
00:15:59,491 --> 00:16:01,160
I'm getting out of here.

299
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,661
Hey, you forgot the coat!

300
00:16:02,661 --> 00:16:04,663
Ricky, are you crazy?!

301
00:16:04,663 --> 00:16:05,664
Give me that!

302
00:16:05,664 --> 00:16:07,166
What's the matter with you?!

303
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:07,666
Honey, be careful.

304
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:09,668
I'm going to call the police.

305
00:16:09,668 --> 00:16:10,669
Be careful.

306
00:16:18,394 --> 00:16:19,395
Stick them up!

307
00:16:19,395 --> 00:16:20,896
(screams)

308
00:16:20,896 --> 00:16:21,897
Pretty good, eh, Rick?

309
00:16:23,215 --> 00:16:25,150
Oh, you've already been here.

310
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:27,553
I have?

311
00:16:27,553 --> 00:16:28,787
I have not!

312
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:34,309
Y-y-you mean that...
that... that guy was real?

313
00:16:34,777 --> 00:16:35,995
What do you mean?

314
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:39,365
There was a real burglar here a
minute ago.

315
00:16:39,365 --> 00:16:40,199
Oh, no!

316
00:16:40,199 --> 00:16:41,200
Yes!

317
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,201
Come on, let's go catch him.

318
00:16:42,201 --> 00:16:43,702
I don't want to catch him.

319
00:16:43,702 --> 00:16:44,703
What are you afraid of?

320
00:16:44,703 --> 00:16:45,704
You've got a gun.

321
00:16:45,704 --> 00:16:47,506
I don't think I'd better use it on
him.

322
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:48,707
Why not?

323
00:17:04,189 --> 00:17:05,691
Good morning, Lucy.

324
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:06,975
Hello.

325
00:17:06,975 --> 00:17:08,977
What's the matter with you?

326
00:17:08,977 --> 00:17:09,978
Oh.

327
00:17:09,978 --> 00:17:12,331
Gee, I thought you'd be happy this
morning.

328
00:17:12,331 --> 00:17:13,782
Believe me, I'd be happy

329
00:17:13,782 --> 00:17:16,568
if a burglar came and didn't get my
mink coat.

330
00:17:16,568 --> 00:17:20,339
Well, I'm happy about that, but I'm
so disappointed in Ricky.

331
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:22,041
Ethel, I'm married to a coward.

332
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:24,543
Are you still moping 'cause Ricky
didn't struggle

333
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:26,445
with an armed burglar?

334
00:17:26,445 --> 00:17:28,130
Well, you should have seen it.

335
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:29,114
Ricky gave him the coat.

336
00:17:29,114 --> 00:17:31,617
I'm surprised he didn't gift wrap it
for him.

337
00:17:31,617 --> 00:17:33,552
Oh...

338
00:17:33,552 --> 00:17:35,054
Well, the way Ricky was acting,

339
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:36,822
it's good the burglar didn't come in
and ask for me.

340
00:17:37,222 --> 00:17:40,175
Now, Lucy.

341
00:17:40,175 --> 00:17:42,478
I'm sure Ricky would have been brave

342
00:17:42,478 --> 00:17:44,630
if he'd known it was a real burglar.

343
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:47,433
(gasps) Uh... I think I hear Fred
calling me.

344
00:17:47,433 --> 00:17:48,767
Ethel, what are you saying?

345
00:17:48,767 --> 00:17:51,103
What do you mean-- real burglar?

346
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:54,706
Uh... nothing, just, uh...

347
00:17:54,706 --> 00:17:56,575
Ethel, what did you start to say?

348
00:17:56,575 --> 00:17:58,444
Well, I might as well tell you.

349
00:17:58,444 --> 00:17:59,645
It's better than

350
00:18:00,045 --> 00:18:03,015
your thinking Ricky is a coward,
anyway.

351
00:18:03,015 --> 00:18:04,216
Was it a real burglar or wasn't it?

352
00:18:04,216 --> 00:18:07,019
It really was, but Ricky thought it
was Fred.

353
00:18:07,019 --> 00:18:08,320
Fred?

354
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,823
Yes, that's why he didn't try to
fight him.

355
00:18:10,823 --> 00:18:13,625
Well, why would Fred pretend to be a
burglar?

356
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:16,462
Uh... I can't tell you any more.

357
00:18:17,463 --> 00:18:18,464
Lucy!

358
00:18:19,465 --> 00:18:22,534
Please! I'm not a yo-yo!

359
00:18:24,219 --> 00:18:26,221
Ethel, I want the whole story.

360
00:18:26,221 --> 00:18:27,723
All right, your honor.

361
00:18:27,723 --> 00:18:32,077
Well, you see, Ricky didn't intend to
give you the coat.

362
00:18:32,077 --> 00:18:36,682
He just rented it to use for a
dancing number down at the club.

363
00:18:36,682 --> 00:18:40,486
You mean this isn't my coat?

364
00:18:40,486 --> 00:18:41,687
No, honey.

365
00:18:41,687 --> 00:18:42,621
Oh...

366
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:44,623
But at least you know

367
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:46,542
Ricky isn't a coward.

368
00:18:46,542 --> 00:18:48,293
How do you like that?

369
00:18:48,293 --> 00:18:53,532
All this time he let me go on
thinking this was my coat.

370
00:18:53,532 --> 00:18:56,835
I've been living in a mink's
paradise.

371
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:00,305
Now, Lucy, don't get upset.

372
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:02,307
Oh, I'm going to get even with him

373
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:04,143
if it's the last thing I do.

374
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:06,261
I ought to carve my initials in it

375
00:19:06,261 --> 00:19:07,763
with an electric razor.

376
00:19:07,763 --> 00:19:09,064
Ohh!

377
00:19:09,064 --> 00:19:10,766
What are you going to do?

378
00:19:10,766 --> 00:19:12,484
You know that costume store downtown

379
00:19:12,484 --> 00:19:14,353
where they sell imitation fur coats?

380
00:19:14,353 --> 00:19:15,270
Yeah.

381
00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:16,772
Well, I'm going down there today

382
00:19:16,772 --> 00:19:18,490
and I'm going to get a coat exactly
like this.

383
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:20,092
And tonight when Ricky comes home...

384
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:27,583
Lucy, this is a pretty poor
imitation.

385
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:31,086
Don't you think Ricky will know it
isn't real mink?

386
00:19:31,086 --> 00:19:32,588
Well, honey, I will,

387
00:19:32,588 --> 00:19:34,373
but I don't think Ricky will.

388
00:19:34,373 --> 00:19:35,874
You know how men are.
Yeah.

389
00:19:35,874 --> 00:19:36,875
I've got this thing fixed

390
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:38,377
so it'll scare him to death.

391
00:19:38,377 --> 00:19:40,762
Now, when we go out there, this is
what I want you to do.

392
00:19:47,636 --> 00:19:49,137
Have you figured out

393
00:19:49,137 --> 00:19:51,139
how to get the coat away from her?

394
00:19:51,139 --> 00:19:52,140
Yup.

395
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:53,141
How?

396
00:19:53,141 --> 00:19:54,643
I'm going to tell her the truth.

397
00:19:54,643 --> 00:19:57,145
Gosh, I hadn't thought of that.

398
00:19:58,030 --> 00:19:59,948
But what of the anniversary?

399
00:19:59,948 --> 00:20:02,367
I'll get her a couple of minks

400
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:04,486
and let her raise her own coat.

401
00:20:06,989 --> 00:20:08,490
Hiya, fellas!
RICKY: Hi, girls.

402
00:20:08,490 --> 00:20:09,992
FRED: Ethel, what are you doing in
that coat?

403
00:20:09,992 --> 00:20:10,993
I asked her to put it on.

404
00:20:10,993 --> 00:20:12,494
I want to take a look at it.

405
00:20:12,494 --> 00:20:13,495
I'm thinking of restyling it.

406
00:20:13,962 --> 00:20:15,464
Restyling it?

407
00:20:15,464 --> 00:20:16,465
Yeah, I think I look better

408
00:20:16,465 --> 00:20:17,966
in a short jacket, don't you, Ethel?

409
00:20:17,966 --> 00:20:18,967
Uh-huh.

410
00:20:18,967 --> 00:20:20,285
What are you cutting?

411
00:20:20,752 --> 00:20:21,753
What are you cutting!?

412
00:20:21,753 --> 00:20:24,756
What are you cutting?

413
00:20:24,756 --> 00:20:30,762
Oh, no! No, no, no!

414
00:20:30,762 --> 00:20:35,267
(babbling in Spanish)

415
00:20:35,267 --> 00:20:36,768
Just a minute.

416
00:20:36,768 --> 00:20:39,771
Oh, no, no, it's terrible!

417
00:20:39,771 --> 00:20:41,273
They've gone crazy.

418
00:20:41,273 --> 00:20:43,775
Crazy they've gone, both of them.

419
00:20:43,775 --> 00:20:45,277
You know what I think?

420
00:20:45,277 --> 00:20:47,079
I think that it's unbalanced.

421
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:49,081
I think it needs shorter sleeves.

422
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:50,082
No, please, please.

423
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:51,583
Please don't cut it no more.

424
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:52,584
Please...

425
00:20:52,584 --> 00:20:55,587
Oh!... look at that.

426
00:20:55,587 --> 00:20:57,589
Well, it'll make a nice muff.

427
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:01,593
Hey, look at me, I'm a fur stylist!

428
00:21:01,593 --> 00:21:05,097
Oh... no, no!

429
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:06,098
Oh, no, no.

430
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:07,099
There you are.

431
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:09,101
Congratulations, Ethel.

432
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:13,388
You're the first woman to ever wear a
mink T-shirt.

433
00:21:13,388 --> 00:21:14,890
Look, Ricky.

434
00:21:16,391 --> 00:21:18,393
Ohh!

435
00:21:28,904 --> 00:21:30,405
How do you like it?

436
00:21:30,405 --> 00:21:31,406
It's darling.

437
00:21:31,406 --> 00:21:32,908
Ricky sent it to me at noon

438
00:21:33,408 --> 00:21:36,878
and at 3:00, these came, and at 5:00,
this arrived.

439
00:21:36,878 --> 00:21:37,879
Oh!
Isn't it dreamy?

440
00:21:37,879 --> 00:21:39,381
Yeah.

441
00:21:39,381 --> 00:21:40,882
Even though you didn't get a mink
coat,

442
00:21:40,882 --> 00:21:42,934
I think you did pretty well for your
anniversary.

443
00:21:42,934 --> 00:21:47,172
So do I, considering it wasn't our
anniversary.

444
00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:50,726
Lucy, what do you mean?

445
00:21:50,726 --> 00:21:53,228
Well, whenever there's a good present
in sight,

446
00:21:53,228 --> 00:21:55,147
I always tell Ricky it's our
anniversary.

447
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:56,782
Oh, no!

448
00:21:58,183 --> 00:21:59,685
When is your anniversary?

449
00:21:59,685 --> 00:22:01,186
It's on, um... uh...

450
00:22:01,186 --> 00:22:02,954
Well, how do you like that?

451
00:22:02,954 --> 00:22:06,658
I've fibbed about it so much and now
I've forgotten.

452
00:22:07,059 --> 00:22:08,026
(doorknob jiggles)

453
00:22:10,028 --> 00:22:13,031
Ricky, darling, I just love the
things you sent!

454
00:22:13,031 --> 00:22:14,533
I'm glad, honey.

455
00:22:14,533 --> 00:22:17,035
You know, I actually ordered all
these things

456
00:22:17,035 --> 00:22:19,037
for your anniversary last week

457
00:22:19,037 --> 00:22:21,039
but, uh, the store forgot to send
them.

458
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:22,040
Really?

459
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:24,443
Yes-- happy anniversary, Lucy.

460
00:22:24,443 --> 00:22:27,129
Happy anniversary, darling.

Lucy!

Good morning.

Shh! Ricky's still asleep.

7
00:00:43,643 --> 00:00:45,245
What's on your mind, Ethel?

8
00:00:45,245 --> 00:00:47,647
Oh, nothing.

9
00:00:52,519 --> 00:00:54,437
You want to borrow something?

10
00:00:54,437 --> 00:00:56,222
Eggs, sugar, flour?

11
00:00:56,689 --> 00:00:58,191
No, thanks.

12
00:01:02,762 --> 00:01:05,081
Are you sure there's nothing on your
mind?

13
00:01:05,081 --> 00:01:07,584
No, not a thing.

14
00:01:12,922 --> 00:01:14,924
How about a cup of coffee?

15
00:01:14,924 --> 00:01:16,743
No, thanks.

16
00:01:18,628 --> 00:01:19,946
Well, I must say

17
00:01:19,946 --> 00:01:21,598
you're taking it calmly.

18
00:01:21,598 --> 00:01:22,882
How's that?

19
00:01:22,882 --> 00:01:25,652
I said I must say you're taking it
calmly.

20
00:01:26,636 --> 00:01:27,887
Now it comes.

21
00:01:27,887 --> 00:01:29,806
What's on your mind, Ethel?

22
00:01:29,806 --> 00:01:32,725
Look, honey, you don't have to
pretend with me.

23
00:01:32,725 --> 00:01:34,394
I come to you this morning

24
00:01:34,394 --> 00:01:37,413
not just as a landlady, not just as a
friend,

25
00:01:37,413 --> 00:01:39,566
but as a shoulder on which to weep

26
00:01:39,566 --> 00:01:41,167
in this time of crisis.

27
00:01:42,035 --> 00:01:43,436
Well.

28
00:01:44,637 --> 00:01:47,941
I think you've been twisting those
curlers too tight.

29
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:49,542
Oh, honey, you're wonderful.

30
00:01:49,542 --> 00:01:51,044
It's not every wife

31
00:01:51,044 --> 00:01:52,829
who can keep her sense of humor

32
00:01:52,829 --> 00:01:54,798
when her husband's running around

33
00:01:54,798 --> 00:01:56,249
with another woman.

34
00:01:56,249 --> 00:01:59,652
(laughing): Oh, Ethel.

35
00:01:59,652 --> 00:02:02,672
Where'd you ever get an idea like
that?

36
00:02:02,672 --> 00:02:06,126
What do you mean another woman?

37
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:09,262
Have you seen this morning's paper?

38
00:02:09,262 --> 00:02:10,063
No.

39
00:02:10,063 --> 00:02:11,898
Oh, well, I'm not going to be

40
00:02:11,898 --> 00:02:13,850
the one to show it to you.

41
00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:15,468
Oh, you're not?

Oh, Ethel, that's just a publicity

48
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,091
It is, huh?

49
00:02:38,091 --> 00:02:40,260
Sure, Ricky's press agent put that
in.

50
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:41,761
He did, huh?

51
00:02:41,761 --> 00:02:44,764
Certainly. He has to keep Ricky's
name before the public.

52
00:02:44,764 --> 00:02:46,266
He does, huh?

53
00:02:46,266 --> 00:02:47,550
Ricky doesn't care anything

54
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:49,853
about that new dancer of his.

55
00:02:49,853 --> 00:02:51,354
Ha! What's she like?

56
00:02:51,354 --> 00:02:53,072
Rosemary?

57
00:02:53,072 --> 00:02:54,390
Oh, she's a brunette

58
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:56,359
and she has a wonderful figure

59
00:02:56,359 --> 00:03:02,198
and she's... young and... quite
pretty.

60
00:03:02,198 --> 00:03:04,951
Oh, Ethel, it's just a publicity
story.

61
00:03:04,951 --> 00:03:07,954
Ricky is trustworthy, fine, honest
and loyal.

62
00:03:08,388 --> 00:03:10,823
Well, if he was brave, clean and
thrifty

63
00:03:10,823 --> 00:03:12,492
he'd be a Boy Scout.

64
00:03:15,295 --> 00:03:17,547
A cat's eye patrol, of course.

65
00:03:17,547 --> 00:03:20,049

down.

Ethel, I love Ricky.

He's the most wonderful husband in
the world,

71
00:03:32,512 --> 00:03:33,863
and I trust him implicitly.

72
00:03:33,863 --> 00:03:36,266
You just keep saying that.

73
00:04:09,632 --> 00:04:12,118
Ricky, it's time to get up, dear.

74
00:04:14,387 --> 00:04:16,389
Time to get up, Ricky.

75
00:04:20,393 --> 00:04:21,728
Hi, honey.

76
00:04:31,204 --> 00:04:33,706
Are you awake, dear?

77
00:04:33,706 --> 00:04:35,341
Uh-huh.

78
00:04:35,341 --> 00:04:38,244
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

79
00:04:38,244 --> 00:04:39,746
Hey, what's that for?

80
00:04:39,746 --> 00:04:41,748
That's for being a big two-timer,

81
00:04:41,748 --> 00:04:43,249
you... you Cuban heel.

82
00:04:45,718 --> 00:04:46,719
What?

83
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:50,223
Open your big cat's eyes and read
this.

84
00:04:56,012 --> 00:04:58,014
Hey, cut it out!

85
00:04:58,014 --> 00:04:59,515
Honey, honey, cut it out!

86
00:04:59,515 --> 00:05:01,017
Honey, come on, now.

87
00:05:01,017 --> 00:05:02,518
Cut it out.

88
00:05:02,518 --> 00:05:04,520
That's just a publicity story.

89
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:05,838
It is, huh?

90
00:05:05,838 --> 00:05:07,824
Sure, my press agent put that in.

91
00:05:07,824 --> 00:05:08,825
He did, huh?

92
00:05:08,825 --> 00:05:11,828
Well, he has to keep my name in front
of the public.

93
00:05:11,828 --> 00:05:12,829
He does, huh?

94
00:05:12,829 --> 00:05:15,531
Why, honey, I don't care anything
about that new dancer.

95
00:05:15,531 --> 00:05:17,033
Ha!

96
00:05:17,033 --> 00:05:19,535
Oh, honey.

97
00:05:19,535 --> 00:05:21,037
You can trust me.

98
00:05:21,037 --> 00:05:22,288
I can, huh?

99
00:05:22,288 --> 00:05:23,222

103

I don't love anyone else but you.

104
00:05:36,052 --> 00:05:39,439
There's nothing between Rosemary and
me, honey.

105
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:41,207
Cross your heart?

106
00:05:41,207 --> 00:05:42,408
Well, I think I have

107
00:05:42,408 --> 00:05:44,811
a better way to convince you.

108
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,489
Did that convince you?

109
00:05:56,489 --> 00:05:59,525
What were we talking about?

110
00:06:01,127 --> 00:06:03,129
I don't know.

111
00:06:03,129 --> 00:06:04,330
Oh, Rosemary.

112
00:06:04,731 --> 00:06:05,581
Oh.

113
00:06:05,581 --> 00:06:08,084
Honey, now, you got to get used to
those kind of stories.

114
00:06:08,084 --> 00:06:09,886
You know, they're going to keep
showing up

115
00:06:09,886 --> 00:06:11,888
as long as I'm in show business.

116
00:06:11,888 --> 00:06:12,889
Well...

117
00:06:12,889 --> 00:06:14,390
Look, honey, why don't you come down
to the club

118
00:06:14,891 --> 00:06:15,391
and see for yourself.

119
00:06:15,391 --> 00:06:16,392
Oh, no, that's not necessary.

120
00:06:16,893 --> 00:06:18,394
Well, if there's any doubt in your
mind at all...

121
00:06:18,394 --> 00:06:19,679
No, no.
None whatsoever.

122
00:06:19,679 --> 00:06:21,848
Come on, honey, you've got to get
dressed.

123
00:06:21,848 --> 00:06:23,349
You'll be late for rehearsal.

124
00:06:23,349 --> 00:06:24,350
Okay, Rosemary.

125
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:25,351
What?!

126
00:06:26,853 --> 00:06:28,855
I meant Lucy.

127
00:06:28,855 --> 00:06:30,356
Yeah.

128
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:47,874
(chatter)

129
00:07:16,235 --> 00:07:18,738
All right, all right, break it up,
break it up.

130
00:07:18,738 --> 00:07:21,240
We have to go through the whole
Saturday night show.

131
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,442
Come on.

132
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:23,910
Let's break it up.

133
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:25,912
(band members grumble)

134
00:07:27,413 --> 00:07:29,982
You're always squawking about
something.

135
00:07:29,982 --> 00:07:31,184
Come on, will you?

136
00:07:31,184 --> 00:07:33,386
We got a lot of work to do today.

137
00:07:33,386 --> 00:07:35,388
Playing cards, arguing about the
salary,

138
00:07:35,388 --> 00:07:36,255
reading the racing form...

139
00:07:36,255 --> 00:07:37,857
Where is Rosemary?

140
00:07:37,857 --> 00:07:39,459
Is she late again?

141
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:41,561
No, no, she's getting into her
costume

142
00:07:42,011 --> 00:07:43,496
for the Jezebel number.

143
00:07:43,496 --> 00:07:44,297
All right.

144
00:07:44,697 --> 00:07:47,200
Well, let's take a...
let's take a letter "A," huh?

145
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,818
And please, the first fellow

146
00:07:48,818 --> 00:07:51,103
who acts like he's playing in his
sleep

147
00:07:51,103 --> 00:07:53,156
is going to get traded to Phil
Spitalny.

148
00:07:53,156 --> 00:07:54,474
Let's do it nice.

149
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:55,775
Put a little pep into it.

150
00:07:56,275 --> 00:07:57,477
Here we go.

151
00:07:57,477 --> 00:08:02,532
(band snores and plays sleepily)

152
00:08:06,619 --> 00:08:10,122
All right, all right, all right.

153
00:08:10,122 --> 00:08:12,625
(whistles)

154
00:08:13,125 --> 00:08:13,626
Hi, Ricky.

155
00:08:14,126 --> 00:08:14,927
Hi.

156
00:08:14,927 --> 00:08:16,262
Is this okay?

157
00:08:16,696 --> 00:08:18,848
That's great, if we don't get raided.

158
00:08:19,348 --> 00:08:20,166
Listen, I want to...

159
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:21,634
Before we start on this number,

160
00:08:21,634 --> 00:08:22,635
I want to find out

161
00:08:22,635 --> 00:08:24,604
what happens in the first part of the
dance.

162
00:08:24,604 --> 00:08:25,972
You know, when you go around me

163
00:08:25,972 --> 00:08:28,608
in the first part of the number, how
does it go?

164
00:08:28,608 --> 00:08:29,408
Step, step, round.

165
00:08:29,408 --> 00:08:30,226
And then what else?

166
00:08:30,226 --> 00:08:31,210
You go around here again?

167
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:32,411
And then I come back here.

168
00:08:32,411 --> 00:08:33,779
And then you come back and we go
again?

169
00:08:33,779 --> 00:08:35,047
(ripping noise)

170
00:08:35,047 --> 00:08:36,449
Oh, no!

171
00:08:36,449 --> 00:08:37,950
Oh...

172
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:39,452
Gee, me and my big feet.

173
00:08:39,952 --> 00:08:41,454
I'm sorry, kid.

174
00:08:42,455 --> 00:08:45,258
Gee, I hope I can get it fixed by the
show.

175
00:08:45,258 --> 00:08:46,058
Well, I tell you what--

176
00:08:46,058 --> 00:08:47,360
give it to me and I'll have it fixed
for you.

177
00:08:47,827 --> 00:08:48,794
Oh, you're a doll.

178
00:08:48,794 --> 00:08:51,047
Well, I'll go and change before this
thing tears some more.

179
00:08:51,047 --> 00:08:52,548
All right.
I'll be back in a minute.

180
00:08:52,548 --> 00:08:55,001
Let's take something now that she's
gone.

181
00:08:55,001 --> 00:08:57,003
Let's take "Cumbachero," huh?

182
00:08:57,003 --> 00:08:58,004
From the top?

183
00:08:58,004 --> 00:08:59,505
All right, here we go.

184
00:08:59,505 --> 00:09:02,258
(band plays)

185
00:09:02,258 --> 00:09:03,259
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

186
00:09:03,259 --> 00:09:05,177
Something is wrong with that first
chord there.

187
00:09:05,177 --> 00:09:06,379
Wait a minute.

188
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:08,431
I've got an E-natural there, Ricky.

189
00:09:08,431 --> 00:09:10,283
E-natural?

190
00:09:10,283 --> 00:09:12,685
That should be E-flat concert.

191
00:09:12,685 --> 00:09:15,071
Let's try it, I think that's right.

192
00:09:15,071 --> 00:09:16,572
Just the brass alone.

193
00:09:16,572 --> 00:09:18,891
(brass plays an E-flat)

194
00:09:18,891 --> 00:09:20,192
That's it, that's it.

195
00:09:20,192 --> 00:09:21,894
Now, everybody now.

196
00:09:21,894 --> 00:09:23,195
All right?

197
00:09:23,195 --> 00:09:24,196
Here we go.

198
00:09:24,196 --> 00:09:25,197
Here it is.

199
00:09:25,197 --> 00:09:27,433
Oh, put it in my coat pocket, will
you?

200
00:09:27,433 --> 00:09:30,419
Listen, get, uh...
the Jezebel number, now.

201
00:09:30,419 --> 00:09:31,921
When she's ready, all right?

202
00:09:31,921 --> 00:09:34,423
The Jezebel number from the top.

203
00:09:34,423 --> 00:09:35,308
Everybody.

204
00:09:35,308 --> 00:09:36,108
Here we go.

205
00:09:36,108 --> 00:09:38,911
(band plays)

206
00:10:00,983 --> 00:10:02,785
Who is it?

207
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:06,839
What?

208
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:08,624
Look, honey, chicken and rice.

209
00:10:08,624 --> 00:10:10,042
Arroz con pollo!

210
00:10:10,042 --> 00:10:10,910
Yeah.
Oh, boy!

211
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:12,912
What did I do to rate all this?

212
00:10:12,912 --> 00:10:15,715
Well, I'm trying to make up for being
so silly this morning.

213
00:10:15,715 --> 00:10:16,916
Oh, honey, forget it.

214
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:18,217
No.

215
00:10:18,217 --> 00:10:20,820
I was wrong to mistrust you and I'm
ashamed of myself.

216
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:22,021
Do you forgive me?

217
00:10:22,021 --> 00:10:24,256
Well, I... I guess so.

218
00:10:24,256 --> 00:10:27,059
Of course, I was terribly hurt.

219
00:10:27,059 --> 00:10:28,427
Oh.

220
00:10:28,427 --> 00:10:29,428
How could you possibly think

221
00:10:29,929 --> 00:10:31,430
that I could look at anyone else but
you?

222
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:34,367
Oh, go on-- you didn't give it a
second thought all day.

223
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:35,184
I din't, huh?

224
00:10:35,184 --> 00:10:37,687
No, you din't.

225
00:10:38,688 --> 00:10:41,657
Listen, I couldn't think of anything
else.

226
00:10:41,657 --> 00:10:43,659
You know where I spent all afternoon?

227
00:10:43,659 --> 00:10:45,161
Where?

228
00:10:45,161 --> 00:10:47,446
Uh... I went to the park.

229
00:10:47,446 --> 00:10:48,447
Oh?

230
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:51,951
Yeah, I went to the park and...

231
00:10:51,951 --> 00:10:57,256
I sat there and...
I fed the pigeons

232
00:10:57,256 --> 00:11:01,794
and, uh... and I brooded.

233
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:05,381
You mean you didn't even go to
rehearsal?

234
00:11:05,381 --> 00:11:07,433
Uh...?

235
00:11:07,433 --> 00:11:09,368
Is that what you meant to tell me?

236
00:11:09,368 --> 00:11:12,104
Well, that's not exactly what I meant
to tell you...

237
00:11:12,104 --> 00:11:14,607
Oh, honey, then you do care about me.

238
00:11:14,607 --> 00:11:16,108
Of course, I do.

239
00:11:16,108 --> 00:11:18,110
You were so upset you couldn't even
go to rehearsal.

240
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:19,478
That's right, honey.

241
00:11:19,478 --> 00:11:20,396
Oh-ho, baby.

242
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,901
Honey, let's eat, would you?

243
00:11:25,901 --> 00:11:26,902
I'm hungry.

244
00:11:26,902 --> 00:11:28,404
Look at all that wonderful food!

245
00:11:28,904 --> 00:11:29,405
What is this?

246
00:11:31,907 --> 00:11:32,908
What is that?

247
00:11:32,908 --> 00:11:34,410
Now, now, baby, now.

248
00:11:34,410 --> 00:11:36,412
Don't "now, baby" me.

249
00:11:36,412 --> 00:11:37,913
What is this?

250
00:11:38,914 --> 00:11:40,916
Oh! Oh, that.

251
00:11:40,916 --> 00:11:43,419
Oh, well, that's, uh...

252
00:11:43,419 --> 00:11:44,920
that's, uh...

253
00:11:45,421 --> 00:11:46,922
a black-lace...

254
00:11:46,922 --> 00:11:48,974
Blue jeans?

255
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:52,178
Now, honey...

256
00:11:52,178 --> 00:11:54,980
So this is why you didn't go to
rehearsal today.

257
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:56,348
Now, wait a minute, honey.

258
00:11:56,348 --> 00:11:58,651
You may have been in the park all
afternoon,

259
00:11:58,651 --> 00:12:00,653
but you weren't feeding the pigeons.

260
00:12:00,653 --> 00:12:03,072
Now, Lucy, if you just give me

261
00:12:03,072 --> 00:12:05,074
a chance to 'splain.

262
00:12:05,074 --> 00:12:06,575
All right.

263
00:12:06,575 --> 00:12:09,078
All right, I want to be fair about
this.

264
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:13,082
'Splain.

265
00:12:16,719 --> 00:12:18,204
Well, you...

266
00:12:30,216 --> 00:12:33,302
You'll have to speak louder than
that.

267
00:12:36,956 --> 00:12:40,059
All right, I'll tell you the truth.

268
00:12:40,059 --> 00:12:41,060
Well, that'll be novel.

269
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:43,062
You haven't tried that before.

270
00:12:44,563 --> 00:12:47,767
I did not go to the park this
afternoon and fed the pigeons.

271
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:50,820
No.

272
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:52,321
I went to rehearsal.

273
00:12:52,321 --> 00:12:53,322
Yeah.

274
00:12:53,322 --> 00:12:56,826
And that's Rosemary's, uh...

275
00:12:56,826 --> 00:12:58,828
black-lace, uh...

276
00:12:58,828 --> 00:13:01,547
Blue jeans.

277
00:13:01,547 --> 00:13:02,915
Yeah.

278
00:13:02,915 --> 00:13:04,917
I tore it by mistake,

279
00:13:04,917 --> 00:13:06,919
so she took it off and she put it in
my pocket.

280
00:13:06,919 --> 00:13:08,921
Ha!

281
00:13:09,922 --> 00:13:12,675
Well, if you don't believe me, ask
the boys in the band.

282
00:13:12,675 --> 00:13:13,676
They were all there.

283
00:13:13,676 --> 00:13:18,180
Well, that must have been a cozy
gathering.

284
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:20,182
Now, look, honey, I went to
rehearsal.

285
00:13:20,182 --> 00:13:21,684
That's part of the costume

286
00:13:21,684 --> 00:13:24,186
that Rosemary wears in the Jezebel
number.

287
00:13:24,687 --> 00:13:27,189
I stepped on it, it tore, she took it
off,

288
00:13:27,189 --> 00:13:28,190
she put in my pocket

289
00:13:28,190 --> 00:13:30,192
and I brought it home for you to fix.

290
00:13:32,495 --> 00:13:34,497
Is that the truth, Ricky?

291
00:13:34,497 --> 00:13:35,498
Cross my heart.

292
00:13:35,498 --> 00:13:38,000
You do believe me, don't you, honey?

293
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,502
Of course, dear.

294
00:13:39,502 --> 00:13:42,004
There is one other question I'd like
to ask you, though.

295
00:13:42,004 --> 00:13:42,822
What's that?

296
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:45,624
Where were you this afternoon?!

297
00:13:48,844 --> 00:13:51,347
Now, look, honey, I told you the
truth

298
00:13:51,347 --> 00:13:53,349
and that's the end of it.

299
00:13:53,349 --> 00:13:54,350
No, it isn't.

300
00:13:54,350 --> 00:13:55,851
All right, if you don't believe me,

301
00:13:55,851 --> 00:13:57,853
come down to the club tonight and see
for yourself.

302
00:13:57,853 --> 00:13:59,855
You're darn right, I will.

303
00:13:59,855 --> 00:14:00,856
All right!
All right!

304
00:14:00,856 --> 00:14:01,857
Well, good-bye.

305
00:14:01,857 --> 00:14:02,858
Good-bye!

306
00:14:18,374 --> 00:14:20,376
Excuse me.

307
00:14:24,563 --> 00:14:26,298
Come on in, Ethel.

308
00:14:26,298 --> 00:14:29,802
I was just...
polishing the doorknob.

309
00:14:33,806 --> 00:14:36,008
I suppose you heard everything.

310
00:14:36,008 --> 00:14:37,243
No, honey, not a thing.

311
00:14:37,676 --> 00:14:39,578
Well, I just quarreled with Ricky.

312
00:14:39,979 --> 00:14:40,813
I don't blame you.

313
00:14:40,813 --> 00:14:42,264
Who does he think he is

314
00:14:42,264 --> 00:14:45,050
going around, tearing girls'
black-lace blue jeans?

315
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:47,887
Didn't hear a thing, huh?

316
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:50,589
Well, I might have caught a word here
and there.

317
00:14:52,775 --> 00:14:54,777
You going to throw all that food out?

318
00:14:54,777 --> 00:14:57,079
Well, Ricky, doesn't want it.

319
00:14:57,079 --> 00:14:58,080
Do you want some?

320
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,865
Um... no, I'm not a bit hungry.

321
00:14:59,865 --> 00:15:03,535
Well, I might just taste it to see
how your recipe is.

322
00:15:06,338 --> 00:15:08,507
(sighs)

323
00:15:14,113 --> 00:15:16,315
What's your next move, honey?

324
00:15:16,315 --> 00:15:18,183
I'm going down to that club tonight.

325
00:15:18,183 --> 00:15:21,520
He's pretty clever asking you to come
down to the club.

326
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:22,321
Huh?

327
00:15:22,321 --> 00:15:24,723
You're not dumb enough to fall for
that, are you?

328
00:15:24,723 --> 00:15:27,526
I should say not.

329
00:15:29,528 --> 00:15:30,779
Fall for what?

330
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:35,067
You go down there tonight; he knows
you're coming;

331
00:15:35,067 --> 00:15:37,569
he's on his good behavior; you're
satisfied;

332
00:15:37,569 --> 00:15:41,540
you come home; and he starts playing
cat and mouse again.

333
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:44,910
Why, that big stinker!

334
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:46,779
Well, gee, what'll I do?

335
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:48,631
You're going to call him up

336
00:15:48,631 --> 00:15:51,133
and tell him you're not coming down.

337
00:15:51,634 --> 00:15:53,135
Yeah!

338
00:15:57,656 --> 00:16:00,192
Why?

339
00:16:00,192 --> 00:16:04,480
Because you're going to sneak in
there without his knowing it

340
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:08,183
and watch the floor show and see
what's really going on.

341
00:16:08,183 --> 00:16:09,935
Gee, that's a wonderful idea.

342
00:16:09,935 --> 00:16:11,570
I'll call right now.

343
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:12,538
Oh, wait a minute.

344
00:16:12,538 --> 00:16:14,356
I can't sneak into the club.

345
00:16:14,356 --> 00:16:15,658
Everybody knows me down there.

346
00:16:15,658 --> 00:16:16,659
That won't work.

347
00:16:16,659 --> 00:16:18,160
Well, we'll think of something.

348
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,161
Well, what?

349
00:16:19,161 --> 00:16:21,163
I don't know, but you call him up

350
00:16:21,163 --> 00:16:23,115
and tell him you're not coming down.

351
00:16:23,615 --> 00:16:24,616
All right.
Just leave it to me.

352
00:16:24,616 --> 00:16:26,118
Okay.

353
00:16:35,711 --> 00:16:38,213
Hello, this is Mrs. Ricky Ricardo.

354
00:16:38,213 --> 00:16:40,265
Would you please tell Mr. Ricardo

355
00:16:40,265 --> 00:16:43,235
that I won't be able to come down to
the club tonight.

356
00:16:43,235 --> 00:16:44,036
That's right.

357
00:16:44,036 --> 00:16:45,237
Thank you.

358
00:16:45,237 --> 00:16:46,889
I've got it.

359
00:16:46,889 --> 00:16:48,390
What?

360
00:16:48,390 --> 00:16:50,843
Where's the best place to see what
he's doing on the stage?

361
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:52,111
Where?

362
00:16:52,111 --> 00:16:53,112
Right on the stage.

363
00:16:53,112 --> 00:16:56,398
Now, he does a number with Rosemary,
doesn't he?

364
00:16:56,398 --> 00:16:57,399
Yeah.

365
00:16:57,399 --> 00:16:59,284
And there are dancing girls...

366
00:16:59,284 --> 00:17:06,792
(music swells)

367
00:17:14,666 --> 00:17:15,667
Right over there

368
00:17:15,667 --> 00:17:18,070
is where the girls go onto the stage.

369
00:17:18,070 --> 00:17:20,339
RICKY: Now make sure you get the
girls out there

370
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:21,724
in time for the Jezebel number.

371
00:17:21,724 --> 00:17:24,376
And tell Bill Caine, the electrician,
to be on his toes.

372
00:17:24,376 --> 00:17:27,096
That's my favorite number and I don't
want it loused up.

373
00:17:27,096 --> 00:17:27,913
Now, get going.

374
00:17:27,913 --> 00:17:28,897
We got to hide.

375
00:17:28,897 --> 00:17:30,399
RICKY: Hey, wait a minute.

376
00:17:30,399 --> 00:17:32,401
There's something else I want to show
you in here.

377
00:18:05,517 --> 00:18:12,191
(band begins playing)

378
00:18:22,484 --> 00:18:28,407
Would be better had I never known

379
00:18:28,407 --> 00:18:33,078
A lover such as you

380
00:18:33,078 --> 00:18:45,624
Forsaken dreams are all for the siren
call of your arms

381
00:18:45,624 --> 00:18:51,363
Like a demon love possess me you

382
00:18:51,363 --> 00:18:55,767
Obsess me constantly

383
00:18:55,767 --> 00:19:08,180
Whatever star is mine that my fate's
design should be

384
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:11,383
Jezebel

385
00:19:11,383 --> 00:19:15,787
Jezebel

386
00:19:16,188 --> 00:19:22,995
If ever a devil was born without a
pair of horns

387
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:26,198
It was you

388
00:19:26,198 --> 00:19:30,202
Jezebel

389
00:19:30,202 --> 00:19:34,640
It was you

390
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:39,578
If ever an angel fell

391
00:19:39,578 --> 00:19:42,381
Jezebel

392
00:19:42,381 --> 00:19:45,984
It was you

393
00:19:45,984 --> 00:19:49,988
Jezebel

394
00:19:49,988 --> 00:19:53,992
It was you

395
00:19:53,992 --> 00:20:02,467
If ever a pair of eyes promised
paradise

396
00:20:02,467 --> 00:20:10,976
Deceiving me, grieving me, leaving me
blue

397
00:20:10,976 --> 00:20:15,063
Jezebel

398
00:20:15,063 --> 00:20:20,185
It was you.

399
00:21:24,583 --> 00:21:31,256
If ever a pair of eyes promised
paradise

400
00:21:31,256 --> 00:21:38,263
Deceiving me, grieving me, leaving me
blue...

401
00:21:39,264 --> 00:21:42,467
Jezebel

402
00:21:42,868 --> 00:21:46,605
Jezebel

403
00:21:46,605 --> 00:21:53,195
If ever the devil's plan was made to
torment man

404
00:21:53,195 --> 00:21:56,698
It was you

405
00:21:56,698 --> 00:22:03,705
Night and day, every way...

406
00:22:04,706 --> 00:22:08,210
Jezebel

407
00:22:08,210 --> 00:22:10,712
Jezebel...

408
00:22:12,064 --> 00:22:24,276
Jezebel!

409
00:22:27,062 --> 00:22:30,882
(crash backstage)

410
00:22:56,091 --> 00:22:58,093
Lucy!

411
00:23:02,114 --> 00:23:04,399
Lucy.

412
00:23:04,399 --> 00:23:06,902
Oh, did I wake you up, dear?

413
00:23:06,902 --> 00:23:09,905
Oh, that's all right.

414
00:23:10,906 --> 00:23:12,407
I went to bed early.

415
00:23:12,407 --> 00:23:13,408
Oh, you did?

416
00:23:13,408 --> 00:23:14,910
Yeah, about 8:30.

417
00:23:14,910 --> 00:23:16,411
What time is it?

418
00:23:16,411 --> 00:23:17,412
It's about 2:30.

419
00:23:17,412 --> 00:23:18,914
Oh, really?

420
00:23:18,914 --> 00:23:21,416
You know, the funniest thing happened
tonight

421
00:23:21,416 --> 00:23:22,834
down at the club.
What?

422
00:23:22,834 --> 00:23:25,904
A strange girl got into the chorus
line.

423
00:23:25,904 --> 00:23:26,705
Oh, really?

424
00:23:27,205 --> 00:23:27,706
Yeah.

425
00:23:28,206 --> 00:23:30,008
She was terrible, too.

426
00:23:32,010 --> 00:23:34,613
She was real ugly.

427
00:23:34,613 --> 00:23:39,017
And she had the worst figure I've
ever seen.

428
00:23:39,017 --> 00:23:42,287
And she didn't know any of the steps
at all.

429
00:23:42,687 --> 00:23:44,689
Well, how could a thing like that

430
00:23:44,689 --> 00:23:46,291
possibly happen, dear?

431
00:23:46,291 --> 00:23:48,693
I haven't got the slightest idea.

432
00:23:50,562 --> 00:23:53,064
(screams)

433
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,803
Oh, you knew it all the time.

434
00:24:02,374 --> 00:24:03,875
Come here.

435
00:24:17,622 --> 00:24:19,741

Yoo-hoo!

Morning, Lucy, I brought up your
mail.

5
00:00:30,814 --> 00:00:33,316
Thanks, Ethel.

6
00:00:34,818 --> 00:00:37,821
A bill, a bill, a letter for Ricky,
an ad...

00:00:37,821 --> 00:00:40,323
Oh, a postcard, isn't that pretty.

8
00:00:40,323 --> 00:00:41,825
Oh, it's from the Bishers.

00:00:41,825 --> 00:00:43,326
"Dear Ricky and Lucy:

10
00:00:43,326 --> 00:00:46,329
"Having a wonderful time here in

Well, go ahead, tell me what the rest
of the card says.

week.

A.M. or P.M.?

25
00:01:14,641 --> 00:01:15,859
Really, Ethel, I'm surprised at you!

26
00:01:15,859 --> 00:01:17,861
You know, this is a federal offense.

27
00:01:17,861 --> 00:01:19,362
If it wasn't for our friendship,

28
00:01:19,362 --> 00:01:21,364
I'd turn you over to the FBI.

29
00:01:21,364 --> 00:01:22,866
Thanks, terribly.

30
00:01:22,866 --> 00:01:23,867

Reading another person's mail is just
awful.

32
00:01:25,869 --> 00:01:28,171
A person's mail is something sacred.

33
00:01:28,171 --> 00:01:29,672
It's like, like a diary.

34
00:01:29,672 --> 00:01:31,174
Why, Ricky and I wouldn't think

35
00:01:31,174 --> 00:01:32,675
of reading each other's mail.

36
00:01:32,675 --> 00:01:34,527
Now, take this letter, for instance.

37
00:01:34,527 --> 00:01:35,728
It's addressed to Ricky

38
00:01:35,728 --> 00:01:37,464
and it's from the War Department.

39
00:01:37,464 --> 00:01:39,599
Now, I'm curious, but I'm certainly
not going to...

40
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:40,884
War Department?!

41
00:01:40,884 --> 00:01:44,888
Gee, you don't think Ricky's been...

42
00:01:44,888 --> 00:01:45,889
been...

43
00:01:45,889 --> 00:01:47,107
Drafted!

44
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:48,475
Oh, please, Ethel.

45
00:01:48,475 --> 00:01:50,977
I, I wasn't going to say it out loud.

46
00:01:50,977 --> 00:01:53,980
Oh, look!

47
00:01:56,049 --> 00:01:57,283
Cheap glue.

48
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:02,522
"You are hereby ordered to report

49
00:02:02,922 --> 00:02:05,325
to Fort Dix, New Jersey, Monday at
3:00."

50
00:02:05,325 --> 00:02:07,760
And it's signed, "Maurice Thompson,

51
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,879
Colonel Infantry Commanding Officer."

52
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:11,331
It's true!

53
00:02:11,831 --> 00:02:13,833
Ricky's been drafted!

54
00:02:13,833 --> 00:02:16,336
Now, Lucy, you've got to be brave.

55
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:18,805
I'll be brave.

56
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:22,642
(wailing)

57
00:02:22,642 --> 00:02:24,310
Is that being brave?

58
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:27,564
It is for a coward like me.

59
00:02:27,564 --> 00:02:29,065
Oh, now, Lucy, pull yourself
together.

60
00:02:29,065 --> 00:02:31,067
You know what you ought to do?

61
00:02:31,067 --> 00:02:32,569
What?

62
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:33,570
Go downtown and buy a new hat.

63
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:36,072
Oh, Ethel, please don't make jokes.

64
00:02:36,072 --> 00:02:37,574
I'm not joking.

65
00:02:37,574 --> 00:02:39,576
It'll take your mind off your
troubles.

66
00:02:39,576 --> 00:02:41,578
No use sitting around here moping.

67
00:02:41,578 --> 00:02:43,580
Well, maybe shopping would help,

68
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:45,081
and while I'm downtown, I'll buy some
yarn

69
00:02:45,081 --> 00:02:48,585
so I can knit Ricky some socks to
wear with his uniform.

70
00:02:48,585 --> 00:02:50,587
That's a good idea!
Now, get your coat.

71
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:51,588
All right.

72
00:02:51,588 --> 00:02:54,090
Oh, I got to glue this back together
again..

73
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:55,592
I'll fix it.

74
00:02:55,592 --> 00:02:57,093
I've had lots of practice at this.

75
00:02:57,093 --> 00:02:58,094
Oh, all right.

76
00:02:58,094 --> 00:02:59,596
Oh, you know, I know where

77
00:02:59,596 --> 00:03:01,297
there's a dilly of a hat!

78
00:03:01,297 --> 00:03:03,716
To take my mind off my troubles, you
know.

79
00:03:03,716 --> 00:03:05,051
Yes.

80
00:03:05,051 --> 00:03:06,052
Yes.

81
00:03:24,537 --> 00:03:26,139
FRED: Ethel!

82
00:03:26,139 --> 00:03:27,740
Hiya, Fred.

83
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:31,828
Hi, Rick, is Ethel up here?

84
00:03:31,828 --> 00:03:33,329
No, I haven't seen her.

85
00:03:33,329 --> 00:03:36,082
She and Lucy must be out shopping
someplace.

86
00:03:36,082 --> 00:03:39,085
Uh-oh, that'll cost me.

87
00:03:39,085 --> 00:03:40,753
Hey, we got a card from the Bishers.

88
00:03:40,753 --> 00:03:41,955
They're in Florida.

89
00:03:41,955 --> 00:03:45,158
Yeah, how do you like that guy
catching a 115-pound sailfish?

90
00:03:46,793 --> 00:03:49,195
How did you know that he caught a
hundred and...

91
00:03:49,195 --> 00:03:50,847
Oh, Ethel.

92
00:03:50,847 --> 00:03:54,350
Some people build model airplanes.

93
00:03:54,350 --> 00:03:56,603
Ethel reads postcards.

94
00:03:56,603 --> 00:04:00,773
Oh, good, I got my orders to go to
Fort Dix Monday.

95
00:04:01,174 --> 00:04:02,609
Orders! Fort Dix!

96
00:04:02,609 --> 00:04:04,110
Hold on, Fred, hold on.

97
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:05,612
I haven't been drafted.

98
00:04:05,612 --> 00:04:07,113
Take it easy.

99
00:04:07,113 --> 00:04:09,616
No, I'm just taking a show down there
to entertain the boys,

100
00:04:10,116 --> 00:04:11,117
and you know how the Army is.

101
00:04:11,117 --> 00:04:13,620
You can't even scratch yourself
without orders.

102
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:16,122
A show! Hey, that ought to be a lot
of fun.

103
00:04:16,122 --> 00:04:17,624
Well, why don't you come along?

104
00:04:17,624 --> 00:04:20,326
You can do one of your old Vaudeville
routines?

105
00:04:20,326 --> 00:04:24,097
Great! You know, I used to do a Civil
War act in Vaudeville.

106
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:27,884
I played the North, and my partner
played the South.

107
00:04:27,884 --> 00:04:29,168
I still got the costumes.

108
00:04:29,168 --> 00:04:29,969
Really?

109
00:04:30,436 --> 00:04:31,437
Want to do it with me?

110
00:04:31,437 --> 00:04:33,539
Why sure, I'll be perfect for it--

111
00:04:33,539 --> 00:04:34,524
Stonewall Ricardo

112
00:04:34,524 --> 00:04:36,025
from south Havana.

113
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:39,028
I'll show you how the thing goes.

114
00:04:39,028 --> 00:04:39,529
All right, Fred.

115
00:04:40,029 --> 00:04:41,030
Hey, I can use that broom there

116
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:42,031
for the musket.

117
00:04:42,031 --> 00:04:43,683
Ta da...

118
00:04:43,683 --> 00:04:46,619
(humming "Dixie")

119
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:49,122
Uh-oh, we're supposed to go out to
dinner Monday night,

120
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:51,858
but I'll just tell Ethel I'd rather
do this.

121
00:04:51,858 --> 00:04:53,076
Look, whatever you do

122
00:04:53,576 --> 00:04:55,578
don't tell Ethel where you're going

123
00:04:55,578 --> 00:04:58,381
because if you tell Ethel, she'll
tell Lucy,

124
00:04:58,381 --> 00:05:00,883
and Lucy will want to get into the
act.

125
00:05:00,883 --> 00:05:02,735
Well, why don't you let her sing a
song or something?

126
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:04,637
It wouldn't be patriotic.

127
00:05:04,637 --> 00:05:05,938
Patriotic?

128
00:05:05,938 --> 00:05:07,757
Have you ever heard Lucy sing?

129
00:05:08,257 --> 00:05:09,609
No.

130
00:05:09,609 --> 00:05:14,063
Our fighting men have been through
enough.

131
00:05:14,063 --> 00:05:15,448
Okay, not a word to Ethel.

132
00:05:15,848 --> 00:05:18,217
I'll just tell her I'm not available
Monday night,

133
00:05:18,217 --> 00:05:19,819
and I won't tell her why.

134
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:22,021
And boy, that'll drive her crazy.

135
00:05:22,021 --> 00:05:22,855
(both chuckling)

136
00:05:22,855 --> 00:05:25,658
Now, spread out and I'll show you how
this thing...

137
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:26,659
Okay.
Spread out.

138
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:28,161
(singing)

139
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:29,162
Hi.

140
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:30,163
Hi.

141
00:05:49,966 --> 00:05:51,968
Ricky, did you read the mail, dear?

142
00:05:51,968 --> 00:05:53,469
Mm-hmm.

143
00:05:53,469 --> 00:05:54,921
Well?

144
00:05:54,921 --> 00:05:56,122
Well what?

145
00:05:56,122 --> 00:05:59,058
Well, was there anything interesting
or different?

146
00:05:59,058 --> 00:06:00,309
No...

147
00:06:00,309 --> 00:06:02,478
Oh, yes, there was something.

148
00:06:02,478 --> 00:06:04,831
Oh? What?

149
00:06:04,831 --> 00:06:07,367
Ben Bisher caught a 115-pound
sailfish.

150
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:11,337
Oh. Don't you have anything else to
tell me, Ricky?

151
00:06:11,337 --> 00:06:12,939
About what?

152
00:06:12,939 --> 00:06:16,142
About, about, about...

153
00:06:16,142 --> 00:06:19,495
(wailing)

154
00:06:19,495 --> 00:06:22,348
What's new.

155
00:06:22,348 --> 00:06:24,300
Lucy, are you all right?

156
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:25,802
I'm fine.

157
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:27,804
Well, honey, what are you crying
about?

158
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:28,805
Did something happen?

159
00:06:28,805 --> 00:06:30,740
Yes, yes, that's it, something
happened.

160
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:32,175
Well, what?

161
00:06:32,175 --> 00:06:33,976
Well, I bought a new hat

162
00:06:33,976 --> 00:06:36,229
and I don't know if you'll like it.

163
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:37,730
Oh, honey, is that all?

164
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:39,232
Well, let me see it.

165
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:41,234
Oh, all right.

166
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,508
Why, honey, I like it.

167
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:50,626
It's real cute.

168
00:06:50,626 --> 00:06:53,362
I'm glad.

169
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:10,179
Hi, Ethel.

170
00:07:10,179 --> 00:07:11,464
Hi.

171
00:07:19,472 --> 00:07:21,274
It's all true, Ethel.

172
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:25,228
Ricky's been drafted and he's trying
to spare me

173
00:07:25,228 --> 00:07:27,280
by not telling me about it.

174
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,983
(wailing)

175
00:07:30,983 --> 00:07:33,386
Oh, Ethel, you're such a good friend

176
00:07:33,386 --> 00:07:35,388
to take my troubles so hard.

177
00:07:35,388 --> 00:07:38,224
Thanks, but I've got troubles of my
own.

178
00:07:38,224 --> 00:07:41,027
Fred just told me he's going with
Ricky Monday.

179
00:07:41,027 --> 00:07:42,628
What?

180
00:07:42,628 --> 00:07:48,718
He wouldn't tell me where, bless his
fat little heart.

181
00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:51,888
You mean, he's been drafted?

182
00:07:51,888 --> 00:07:55,341
No, they're not that hard up.

183
00:07:55,341 --> 00:07:58,211
He must have enlisted.

184
00:07:58,611 --> 00:08:01,414
(wailing)

185
00:08:09,455 --> 00:08:11,858
Ethel, we got to pull ourselves
together.

186
00:08:11,858 --> 00:08:13,693
If our men are going to be

187
00:08:13,693 --> 00:08:15,178
so brave and so wonderful,

188
00:08:15,178 --> 00:08:16,963
the least we can do is make it

189
00:08:16,963 --> 00:08:19,081
as easy as possible for them.

190
00:08:19,081 --> 00:08:20,583
Yes.

191
00:08:22,869 --> 00:08:25,922
I'm knitting some socks for Fred,
too.

192
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:28,508
That's nice.

193
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:30,643
We got to be brave, Lucy.

194
00:08:30,643 --> 00:08:32,678
Brave.

195
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:36,282
We've got to keep a stiff upper lip.

196
00:08:38,284 --> 00:08:40,786
Stiff.

197
00:08:40,786 --> 00:08:46,809
(wailing)

198
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:57,770
Halt! Parade rest!

199
00:08:57,770 --> 00:09:07,964
(humming "Dixie")

200
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:09,615
Right shoulder, arms!

201
00:09:09,615 --> 00:09:12,001
One, two, three!

202
00:09:14,003 --> 00:09:15,004
No, no, no!

203
00:09:15,004 --> 00:09:17,506
Who told you to throw your gun away?

204
00:09:17,506 --> 00:09:18,507
I'm sorry, Fred.

205
00:09:18,507 --> 00:09:19,508
Oh, you're sorry.

206
00:09:19,508 --> 00:09:21,010
What good does that do me?

207
00:09:21,010 --> 00:09:22,511
Come on, now, try it again.

208
00:09:22,511 --> 00:09:24,013
All right.

209
00:09:24,013 --> 00:09:25,514
Left face!

210
00:09:25,514 --> 00:09:27,016
Forward march!

211
00:09:27,016 --> 00:09:29,018
Hut!

212
00:09:29,018 --> 00:09:30,519
Hut!

213
00:09:30,519 --> 00:09:32,738
Hut!

214
00:09:33,139 --> 00:09:34,106
Hut!

215
00:09:34,106 --> 00:09:34,941
(coughing)

216
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:38,911
What's the matter with you, Ricky?

217
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:40,413
Why did you hut it?

218
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:42,415
I didn't hut it, I was coughing!

219
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:44,417
Well, how can I know whether you're
coughing or hutting?

220
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:45,918
I don't know where you're going.

221
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:47,420
I'm going this way, and you hut, hut,
hut.

222
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:49,422
You've been doing it all afternoon.

223
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:50,423
Now, what's the matter with you?

224
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:52,425
Well, I'm sorry, Fred.

225
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:54,427
I just don't seem to be able to
concentrate.

226
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:55,928
I'm worried.

227
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:56,929
About what?

228
00:09:56,929 --> 00:09:58,431
Well, maybe you can help me.

229
00:09:58,431 --> 00:10:01,350
You've been married for a long while,
haven't you?

230
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:04,303
Now, why bring that up when we're
having such a good time?

231
00:10:05,554 --> 00:10:08,557
Well, maybe you know women better
than I do.

232
00:10:08,557 --> 00:10:10,776
Lucy's been acting strange lately.

233
00:10:10,776 --> 00:10:13,579
Strange?
How can you tell?

234
00:10:13,579 --> 00:10:14,780
Look, I'm serious.

235
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:18,534
I mean, for one thing, she breaks
into tears

236
00:10:18,534 --> 00:10:20,036
for no reason at all,

237
00:10:20,036 --> 00:10:21,537
and she seems terribly nervous.

238
00:10:21,537 --> 00:10:23,923
And the other day, I walked into the
room

239
00:10:23,923 --> 00:10:26,392
and she hid whatever she was doing
behind her back.

240
00:10:26,392 --> 00:10:27,660
It looked like knitting.

241
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:29,011
Knitting?!

242
00:10:29,011 --> 00:10:29,996
Yeah.

243
00:10:29,996 --> 00:10:35,301
Well, Ricky, my boy, congratulations!

244
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:36,802
Congratulations?

245
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:39,472
Why, it's as plain as the nose on
your face.

246
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:41,073
You're going to be a father.

247
00:10:41,073 --> 00:10:43,876
Me? Father?

248
00:10:43,876 --> 00:10:45,978
When a woman cries for no reason,

249
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:48,397
sits down and knits tiny little
things,

250
00:10:48,898 --> 00:10:50,116
what else?

251
00:10:50,116 --> 00:10:51,717
Me? Father?

252
00:10:51,717 --> 00:10:52,568
Of course!

253
00:10:52,568 --> 00:10:55,087
Me? Father?

254
00:10:55,087 --> 00:10:57,990
Yeah, you father, Lucy mother,

255
00:10:57,990 --> 00:10:59,992
me Tarzan!

256
00:11:04,747 --> 00:11:05,998
Oh, gosh.

257
00:11:05,998 --> 00:11:07,867
Well, now that we've straightened out

258
00:11:07,867 --> 00:11:10,336
your paternal status, let's go on
with the routine.

259
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:11,671
Okay.

260
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:14,173
Of course, it could be something
else.

261
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:16,676
When are you going to take facts like
I do, Ricky?

262
00:11:17,076 --> 00:11:18,778
Ethel is nervous and weepy lately,
too.

263
00:11:18,778 --> 00:11:20,379
She's been knitting little things

264
00:11:20,379 --> 00:11:21,847
and hiding them from me.

265
00:11:21,847 --> 00:11:24,967
But you don't think that I...

266
00:11:24,967 --> 00:11:25,968
that I...

267
00:11:27,970 --> 00:11:30,973
No! Oh, no!

268
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:32,591
Fred!

269
00:11:32,591 --> 00:11:36,228
Congratulations, old boy!

270
00:11:36,228 --> 00:11:39,532
Imagine that, both of them!

271
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:41,534
I can't imagine it.

272
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:43,536
Isn't that wonderful!

273
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:45,538
Let's give them a shower.

274
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:47,039
What for?

275
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:49,041
I mean a surprise party shower.

276
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:52,545
And we can try our act out on the
crowd.

277
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:54,547
All right, we'll give them a surprise
party Sunday night

278
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:56,048
before we leave for Fort Dix.

279
00:11:56,048 --> 00:11:57,049
Good deal!

280
00:11:57,049 --> 00:12:00,052
Gee whiz, Lucy's going to be a mother

281
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:02,488
and I'm going to be a father.

282
00:12:02,488 --> 00:12:05,341
I know just how you feel, son.

283
00:12:05,341 --> 00:12:08,344
Ethel's going to be a mother

284
00:12:08,344 --> 00:12:11,347
and I'm going to be a f... f... f...

285
00:12:32,218 --> 00:12:34,220
Ethel, does this look right?

286
00:12:38,224 --> 00:12:39,692
Right for what?

287
00:12:39,692 --> 00:12:41,193
Well, you don't have to get nasty
about it.

288
00:12:41,193 --> 00:12:43,696
I suppose yours is going to win a
prize.

289
00:12:43,696 --> 00:12:45,197
It's better than yours.

290
00:12:45,197 --> 00:12:46,198
Let's see.

291
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:49,702
Yeah, I guess you're right.

292
00:12:49,702 --> 00:12:52,204
Gee, I guess I'm past the sock stage.

293
00:12:52,204 --> 00:12:54,206
I better try for a blanket.

294
00:12:56,208 --> 00:12:58,210
I think you're past the blanket
stage.

295
00:12:58,210 --> 00:13:00,212
You'd better try for a tent.

296
00:13:00,212 --> 00:13:01,714
Oh, well, I'm surprised we can knit
at all,

297
00:13:01,714 --> 00:13:04,216
what with our husbands going into the
Army.

298
00:13:04,216 --> 00:13:06,719
Our two wonderful little boys.

299
00:13:06,719 --> 00:13:10,055
Yeah. Gee, they're so anxious to be
good soldiers.

300
00:13:10,055 --> 00:13:11,323
You know what they were doing

301
00:13:11,323 --> 00:13:12,925
when I went up to the apartment a
little while ago?

302
00:13:12,925 --> 00:13:14,126
What?

303
00:13:14,126 --> 00:13:14,927
Drilling.

304
00:13:14,927 --> 00:13:16,128
Drilling.
Yeah.

305
00:13:16,128 --> 00:13:18,531
Marching up and down with a broom and
a mop.

306
00:13:18,531 --> 00:13:22,601
Oh, I wish there was something more
we could do for them

307
00:13:22,601 --> 00:13:25,037
besides just knitting socks and
tents.

308
00:13:27,039 --> 00:13:30,342
I know, let's give them a going-away
party.

309
00:13:30,342 --> 00:13:32,011
A surprise party!

310
00:13:32,011 --> 00:13:34,296
Yeah, we'll give it Sunday night just
before they leave.

311
00:13:34,296 --> 00:13:35,114
That's a wonderful idea.

312
00:13:35,514 --> 00:13:36,515
Who will we ask?

313
00:13:36,515 --> 00:13:38,517
Well, let's see now, there's the
Sedgewicks,

314
00:13:38,517 --> 00:13:41,487
the Orsattis, the Bezelles, Billy
Josefi...

315
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:47,910
Ethel, do you think the boys found
out about the party tonight?

316
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:50,913
No. They can't think about anything
but going into the Army.

317
00:13:50,913 --> 00:13:53,415
Yeah. Gee, this is their last night
as civilians.

318
00:13:53,415 --> 00:13:55,201
Now, remember, we're not going to
argue with them,

319
00:13:55,201 --> 00:13:56,702
no matter what happens.

320
00:13:56,702 --> 00:13:59,205
I wouldn't think of it.

321
00:13:59,205 --> 00:14:00,706
Where are they now?

322
00:14:00,706 --> 00:14:02,508
They're downstairs drilling.

323
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:04,577
Bless their little britches.

324
00:14:04,577 --> 00:14:05,878
Now, here's the plan for the party:

325
00:14:05,878 --> 00:14:08,380
I told everybody that I'd leave the
front door unlocked.

326
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:09,682
Unlocked.
Yeah.

327
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:12,484
And that they should tiptoe in and
hide someplace.

328
00:14:12,484 --> 00:14:14,720
How we gonna keep the boys occupied
so they won't notice?

329
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,388
Oh, now, don't worry.

330
00:14:16,388 --> 00:14:17,690
We'll manage some way.

331
00:14:22,194 --> 00:14:23,696
Who left this door unlocked?

332
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:25,197
I don't know.

333
00:14:25,197 --> 00:14:28,000
Listen, do you think the girls
suspect anything

334
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,485
about the party tonight?

335
00:14:29,985 --> 00:14:30,986
No, with all that knitting

336
00:14:30,986 --> 00:14:32,872
and acting like little mothers,

337
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:34,707
they don't know anything else is
going on.

338
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:38,210
Listen, I told everybody

339
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:40,212
that I was going to leave the back
door unlocked,

340
00:14:40,212 --> 00:14:43,499
and that they should sneak in through
the kitchen.

341
00:14:43,499 --> 00:14:45,751
So I want you to keep your eye on the
kitchen door.

342
00:14:45,751 --> 00:14:47,353
Well, how we gonna hide them from the
girls?

343
00:14:47,353 --> 00:14:49,171
Well, look, whenever the people start
coming in,

344
00:14:49,171 --> 00:14:50,673
we'll just have to figure out some
way

345
00:14:51,173 --> 00:14:53,175
to get the girls back into the
bedroom.

346
00:14:53,175 --> 00:14:55,177
Watch it now, here they come.

347
00:14:55,177 --> 00:14:56,178
I don't know.

348
00:14:56,178 --> 00:14:57,680
Oh, hi, fellas.

349
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,665
Hi.
Hi, girls.

350
00:15:09,992 --> 00:15:13,245
(chuckling nervously)

351
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:16,248
(all start speaking at once)

352
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:21,253
(knocking)

353
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:22,488
Did you hear anything?

354
00:15:22,488 --> 00:15:24,206
I thought I did.

355
00:15:24,206 --> 00:15:25,424
(knocking)

356
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:27,376
I think someone's at the door.

357
00:15:27,376 --> 00:15:28,377
I'll get it.

358
00:15:28,377 --> 00:15:29,878
No, no, I'll get it!

359
00:15:29,878 --> 00:15:30,879
I'll get it!

360
00:15:30,879 --> 00:15:32,381
Oh, all right.

361
00:15:37,386 --> 00:15:38,837
No, there's no one here.

362
00:15:38,837 --> 00:15:42,608
Ricky, would you get me a drink of
water, please, dear?

363
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:43,609
Oh, all right.

364
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:45,110
I'd like a glass of water, too, Fred.

365
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:46,111
Well, I'll get them both.

366
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:47,613
No!
No!

367
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:51,066
I can't drink a glass of water

368
00:15:51,066 --> 00:15:52,568
unless Fred brings it to me

369
00:15:52,568 --> 00:15:54,036
with his own little hands.

370
00:15:54,036 --> 00:15:55,037
Okay, I'll get 'em both.

371
00:15:55,037 --> 00:15:56,538
No!
No!

372
00:15:56,538 --> 00:15:59,041
Ricky... Ricky, honey, you wouldn't
want me to have anything

373
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:01,543
that you didn't bring me your little
ole self,

374
00:16:01,543 --> 00:16:03,045
now, would you, baby?

375
00:16:03,045 --> 00:16:05,047
Well, honey, what difference would it
make...

376
00:16:05,047 --> 00:16:06,548
Well, it does make a difference,
though, honey.

377
00:16:06,548 --> 00:16:08,550
I can't tell you exactly what it is,

378
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:10,052
but there is a difference.

379
00:16:10,052 --> 00:16:11,553
All right, all right.

380
00:16:11,553 --> 00:16:13,055
Well, we'll both go.

381
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:14,056
LUCY: Okay.

382
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:19,545
Shh!

383
00:16:19,545 --> 00:16:20,746
Where?

384
00:16:20,746 --> 00:16:21,947
The closet!

385
00:16:26,185 --> 00:16:27,686
Who locked that door?

386
00:16:27,686 --> 00:16:28,988
Well, unlock it.

387
00:16:35,944 --> 00:16:37,446
We brought you milk.

388
00:16:37,446 --> 00:16:38,447
Milk?

389
00:16:38,447 --> 00:16:39,948
It's better for you.

390
00:16:39,948 --> 00:16:41,450
Oh, thanks.

391
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:50,042
How's the milk, girls?

392
00:16:50,042 --> 00:16:52,044
ETHEL: Fine.

393
00:16:52,044 --> 00:16:55,047
LUCY: It's all right if you like
milk.

394
00:16:55,047 --> 00:16:56,048
Uh, Lucy...

395
00:16:56,548 --> 00:16:57,549
Hmm?

396
00:16:57,549 --> 00:16:58,550
Your nose is shiny.

397
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:00,552
It is? I just powdered it.

398
00:17:00,552 --> 00:17:02,054
Well, stand still a minute, will you?

399
00:17:02,054 --> 00:17:04,056
I want to see how my hair looks.

400
00:17:04,056 --> 00:17:05,557
Oh, you!

401
00:17:05,557 --> 00:17:08,193
Okay, I'll go powder it.

402
00:17:08,193 --> 00:17:10,729
Ethel's nose is shiny, too.

403
00:17:10,729 --> 00:17:12,147
It is not, is it, Fred?

404
00:17:12,147 --> 00:17:13,148
Well, I can't tell,

405
00:17:13,148 --> 00:17:15,150
there's such a bright reflection
coming off...

406
00:17:15,150 --> 00:17:18,654
Now, listen, Fred Mertz, it...

407
00:17:18,654 --> 00:17:19,655
Oh, all right.

408
00:17:19,655 --> 00:17:21,657
I'll go powder my nose.

409
00:17:26,161 --> 00:17:27,162
Where?

410
00:17:27,162 --> 00:17:28,163
The closet!

411
00:17:28,163 --> 00:17:29,164
Shh!

412
00:17:37,172 --> 00:17:38,590
Well, here we are.

413
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:39,425
Do we look any better?

414
00:17:39,425 --> 00:17:40,926
Oh, yes, fine.
Look great now.

415
00:17:49,935 --> 00:17:51,437
Uh, Ricky, I'm thirsty again.

416
00:17:51,437 --> 00:17:53,939
Would you get me a drink of water,
dear?

417
00:17:53,939 --> 00:17:57,743
Well, honey, you haven't finished
this one yet.

418
00:17:57,743 --> 00:17:59,244
Oh.

419
00:18:01,246 --> 00:18:02,531
More milk.

420
00:18:02,531 --> 00:18:05,484
Ethel, you just had a full glass of
milk.

421
00:18:05,484 --> 00:18:07,836
I don't know why I seem to be so
thirsty tonight.

422
00:18:07,836 --> 00:18:10,839
I must have had something salty for
dinner.

423
00:18:10,839 --> 00:18:13,342
All right, all right, more milk.

424
00:18:13,342 --> 00:18:14,843
I'll get you some more, too, honey.

425
00:18:14,843 --> 00:18:16,345
All right.

426
00:18:19,848 --> 00:18:20,699
Shh!

427
00:18:20,699 --> 00:18:21,967
The closet?

428
00:18:21,967 --> 00:18:23,469
The closet.

429
00:18:39,735 --> 00:18:41,236
Here you are, girls.

430
00:18:49,244 --> 00:18:50,746
Uh, Lucy?

431
00:18:50,746 --> 00:18:51,747
What?

432
00:18:51,747 --> 00:18:53,248
Your nose is shiny again.

433
00:18:53,248 --> 00:18:56,752
Oh, now, Ricky, really, it couldn't
be shiny...

434
00:18:56,752 --> 00:18:58,253
Oh, all right, dear.

435
00:18:58,253 --> 00:18:59,755
And Ethel...

436
00:18:59,755 --> 00:19:01,256
I know, I'm going.

437
00:19:05,761 --> 00:19:06,762
Where?

438
00:19:06,762 --> 00:19:07,763
The closet!

439
00:19:17,573 --> 00:19:20,359
Hey, Fred, come on, I got a wonderful
idea.

440
00:19:20,359 --> 00:19:21,860
Good.

441
00:19:33,372 --> 00:19:36,375
(guffawing)

442
00:19:38,377 --> 00:19:40,379
Oh, Lucy, you're crazy!

443
00:19:40,379 --> 00:19:43,882
I'm glad you kids didn't lose your
sense of humor.

444
00:19:43,882 --> 00:19:45,551
Why should we lose our sense of
humor?

445
00:19:45,551 --> 00:19:46,802
Yeah.

446
00:19:46,802 --> 00:19:48,303
Well, you know how women act

447
00:19:48,303 --> 00:19:50,305
when they're in your condition.

448
00:19:50,305 --> 00:19:52,791
My condition?
What's my condition?

449
00:19:52,791 --> 00:19:53,609
Well, honey...

450
00:19:54,109 --> 00:19:54,927
The same as Ethel's.

451
00:19:54,927 --> 00:19:56,195
Ethel's?

452
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:57,696
Sure, we know all about it.

453
00:19:57,696 --> 00:19:58,964
Come on, honey, sit down.

454
00:19:58,964 --> 00:20:00,866
You have to take it real easy, you
know,

455
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:01,867
and have a good rest,

456
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:03,368
be real comfortable all the time.

457
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:05,037
Fred, what are you talking about?

458
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:06,455
Come on, darling, sit down now.

459
00:20:06,455 --> 00:20:08,140
Why?

460
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:11,543
(humming)

461
00:20:11,543 --> 00:20:13,328
Coochie, coochie, coochie.

462
00:20:13,328 --> 00:20:14,830
Now, wait a minute.

463
00:20:14,830 --> 00:20:17,132
You guys act like somebody's going to
have a baby.

464
00:20:17,132 --> 00:20:18,634
Well, someone is.

465
00:20:18,634 --> 00:20:20,652
(gasps)

466
00:20:22,287 --> 00:20:23,889
Well, don't look at me!

467
00:20:24,756 --> 00:20:26,758
(gasps)

468
00:20:26,758 --> 00:20:28,360
Well, don't look at me!

469
00:20:29,962 --> 00:20:34,650
Well, don't look at us!

470
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:35,901
Well, what made you think

471
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:38,387
anybody was going to have a baby?

472
00:20:38,387 --> 00:20:41,356
Well what were all those little
things that you were knitting?

473
00:20:41,356 --> 00:20:42,858
Knitting!

474
00:20:42,858 --> 00:20:44,860
Oh, honey, we were knitting socks

475
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:47,613
for you and Fred to take to Fort Dix
tomorrow.

476
00:20:47,613 --> 00:20:49,915
(laughing)

477
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:50,916
You knew about that?

478
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:53,919
Yes, and we're just dying to see you
in your uniforms.

479
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:55,687
Well, come on, Rick, let's put them
on.

480
00:20:55,687 --> 00:20:56,955
Yeah, we'll put them on!

481
00:20:56,955 --> 00:20:57,456
Let's go, Fred!

482
00:20:57,456 --> 00:20:58,957
We'll put them right on.

483
00:20:59,958 --> 00:21:02,527
Oh, imagine them thinking we were
going to have babies!

484
00:21:02,527 --> 00:21:05,797
Yeah, they certainly can jump at some
wrong conclusions.

485
00:21:05,797 --> 00:21:07,683
Yeah. Gee, I wish there were

486
00:21:07,683 --> 00:21:10,302
some wrong conclusions that we could
jump to.

487
00:21:10,302 --> 00:21:11,503
RICKY: Are you ready, girls?!

488
00:21:11,903 --> 00:21:13,855
Yes!
Yeah, we're ready.

489
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:17,359
Ooh, we're going to get to see our
soldier boys!

490
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:19,861
RICKY: Are you ready, Colonel Mertz?

491
00:21:19,861 --> 00:21:21,113
Colonel?

492
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:23,148
FRED: Ready, General Ricardo!

493
00:21:23,148 --> 00:21:24,950
General?

494
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:27,452
(humming "Dixie")

495
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:38,463
Ethel, they're fighting on opposite
sides!

496
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:44,002
(all laughing)

497
00:21:45,504 --> 00:21:48,006
Oh, Ricky, you should have seen

498
00:21:48,006 --> 00:21:50,008
the expression on your face!

499
00:21:50,008 --> 00:21:52,010
Well, honey, how was I supposed to
know?

500
00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:55,180
Well, we all did some pretty fancy
jumping to conclusions!

501
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:56,565
You know what?
What?

502
00:21:56,565 --> 00:21:58,033
We invited everyone here

503
00:21:58,033 --> 00:21:59,685
for a going-away party!

504
00:21:59,685 --> 00:22:00,686
No kidding!

505
00:22:00,686 --> 00:22:02,187
Well, you know something?

506
00:22:02,187 --> 00:22:04,056
We invited them over here for a
shower.

507
00:22:04,056 --> 00:22:05,440
A shower?

508
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:06,942
(laughter)

509
00:22:06,942 --> 00:22:08,894
ALL: The closet!

510
00:22:13,198 --> 00:22:14,700
Oh, look at these poor people!

511
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:15,701
Easy!

512
00:22:15,701 --> 00:22:17,703
Easy!

513
00:22:17,703 --> 00:22:18,704
Easy!

514
00:22:28,714 --> 00:22:30,215
Pull them apart!
Pull them apart!

515
00:22:30,716 --> 00:22:31,717
Unglue, unglue.

516
00:22:31,717 --> 00:22:33,719
Unglue them there, pull them apart!

517
00:22:36,855 --> 00:22:40,225
ANNOUNCER: Lucy and Ricky will be
back with a little surprise.

518
00:22:40,225 --> 00:22:41,426
Stand by.

519
00:22:42,227 --> 00:22:48,166
(clock chiming)

520
00:22:58,226 --> 00:22:59,227
(screaming)

521
00:22:59,227 --> 00:23:01,229
(all laughing)

522
00:23:01,229 --> 00:23:02,731
Oh, look!

523
00:23:02,731 --> 00:23:04,232
Fred!
Ethel!
Lucy!

524
00:23:05,233 --> 00:23:06,234
Fred!

525
00:23:06,234 --> 00:23:07,736
Merry Christmas!
Merry Christmas!

526
00:23:07,736 --> 00:23:09,237
(all laughing)

527
00:23:09,237 --> 00:23:11,239
Merry Christmas, Fred.

528
00:23:11,239 --> 00:23:13,742
We're all Santa Clauses.

529
00:23:13,742 --> 00:23:14,743
Yeah.

530
00:23:14,743 --> 00:23:16,244
How about that.

531
00:23:16,244 --> 00:23:17,746
Let's put our presents under the
tree.

532
00:23:18,246 --> 00:23:19,748
Okay, okay, here we go.

533
00:23:19,748 --> 00:23:20,749
Oh, that's nice.

534
00:23:20,749 --> 00:23:21,750
(laughter)

535
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:23,251
Gee!

536
00:23:23,251 --> 00:23:26,254
Hey, Santa, you put on

537
00:23:26,254 --> 00:23:27,756
a little weight, didn't you?

538
00:23:27,756 --> 00:23:29,257
How about you?

539
00:23:29,257 --> 00:23:30,258
Yeah.

540
00:23:30,258 --> 00:23:32,260
How about you, Ethel?

541
00:23:32,761 --> 00:23:35,764
Fred, where'd you ever find such a
big pillow?

542
00:23:35,764 --> 00:23:37,265
Huh? Why aren't you answering me?

543
00:23:37,265 --> 00:23:38,767
I'm not wearing a pillow.

544
00:23:38,767 --> 00:23:40,268
Oh!

545
00:23:40,268 --> 00:23:41,770
Come on, let's open all our presents.

546
00:23:41,770 --> 00:23:42,270
All right.

547
00:23:42,270 --> 00:23:43,271
Okay.

548
00:23:43,271 --> 00:23:44,773
Oh, no, no, let's sing first.

549
00:23:44,773 --> 00:23:45,774
Sing?
Sing?
Sing?

550
00:23:45,774 --> 00:23:46,274
Well, yeah.

551
00:23:46,775 --> 00:23:48,276
Everything is so wonderful,

552
00:23:48,276 --> 00:23:51,780
and spending Christmas with our good
friends...

553
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:53,782
I just feel like serenading the
world.

554
00:23:53,782 --> 00:23:54,900
Okay.

555
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:56,318
I know a wonderful Cuban melody.

556
00:23:56,318 --> 00:23:57,319
It's called "Cascabeles."

557
00:23:57,319 --> 00:23:58,320
FRED: Well, let's hear it.

558
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:59,321
Go ahead, sing it.
All right.

559
00:23:59,321 --> 00:24:01,823
Cascabeles, cascabeles

560
00:24:01,823 --> 00:24:03,325
Cantan todo el día

561
00:24:03,325 --> 00:24:05,327
Cascabeles, cascabeles

562
00:24:05,327 --> 00:24:06,828
Traen la alegria

563
00:24:06,828 --> 00:24:07,829
Hey!

564
00:24:07,829 --> 00:24:09,331
That's "Jingle Bells."

565
00:24:09,331 --> 00:24:10,332
"Jingle Bells"?

566
00:24:10,332 --> 00:24:11,633
Sure.

567
00:24:11,633 --> 00:24:12,634
Well, how about that.

568
00:24:12,634 --> 00:24:14,636
You Americans steal all our good
songs.

569
00:24:14,636 --> 00:24:15,637
(laughing)

570
00:24:15,637 --> 00:24:18,140
Hey, let's all sing it, huh, Santa
Clauses?

571
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:19,141
All right.
All right.
All right.

572
00:24:19,141 --> 00:24:24,146
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle
all the way

573
00:24:24,146 --> 00:24:27,149
Oh, what fun it is to ride in a
one-horse open sleigh

574
00:24:27,149 --> 00:24:31,153
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle
all the way

575
00:24:31,153 --> 00:24:35,157
Oh, what fun it is to ride in a
one-horse open sleigh

576
00:24:35,157 --> 00:24:38,643
Dashing through the snow, in a
one-horse open sleigh

577
00:24:38,643 --> 00:24:42,247
O'er the fields we go, laughing all
the way

578
00:24:42,681 --> 00:24:46,001
Bells on bobtail ring, making spirits
bright

579
00:24:46,001 --> 00:24:48,003
What fun it is to ride and sing

580
00:24:48,003 --> 00:24:49,504
A sleighing song tonight

581
00:24:49,504 --> 00:24:53,508
Oh, jingle bells, jingle bells,
jingle all the way

582
00:24:53,508 --> 00:24:57,012
Oh, what fun it is to ride in a
one-horse open sleigh

583
00:24:57,012 --> 00:25:01,016
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle
all the way

584
00:25:01,016 --> 00:25:04,519
Oh, what fun it is to ride in a
one-horse open sleigh.

585
00:25:04,519 --> 00:25:08,023
(laughing merrily)

586
00:25:20,035 --> 00:25:21,536
Ow!

587
00:25:40,906 --> 00:25:44,109
ALL: Merry Christmas, everybody!

588
00:25:46,244 --> 00:25:48,246

1
00:00:46,846 --> 00:00:48,581
Mm... that was good, Lucy.

2
00:00:48,581 --> 00:00:49,449
Want some more?

3
00:00:49,449 --> 00:00:51,618
I have eight or nine pieces left in
the kitchen.

4
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:53,353
No, three's my limit.

5
00:00:53,353 --> 00:00:54,654
Ha!

6
00:00:56,823 --> 00:00:59,426
Well, I guess I'd better go put on a
new face.

7
00:00:59,426 --> 00:01:00,727
Yeah, me too.

8
00:01:00,727 --> 00:01:03,763
Say, did you see that little
polka-dot dress at Orbach's?

9
00:01:03,763 --> 00:01:05,498
The one with the white, ruffled
collar?

10
00:01:05,498 --> 00:01:07,667
LUCY: Wasn't that the cutest thing

11
00:01:07,667 --> 00:01:08,968
you've ever seen?

12
00:01:08,968 --> 00:01:10,703
What's that for?

13
00:01:10,703 --> 00:01:13,306
Well, I'm always hoping that this
time will be the charm.

14
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:14,607
What do you mean?

15
00:01:14,607 --> 00:01:16,776
Ethel keeps going out to put on a new
face

16
00:01:16,776 --> 00:01:18,945
but she always comes back with the
old one.

17
00:01:22,415 --> 00:01:23,716
Well, you know how women are.

18
00:01:23,716 --> 00:01:25,018
Yeah.

19
00:01:25,018 --> 00:01:26,319
If Lucy doesn't have any lipstick on,

20
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:27,187
she thinks she's naked.

21
00:01:27,187 --> 00:01:28,488
"Niked"?

22
00:01:28,488 --> 00:01:30,657
Yeah, you know-- not wearing a thing.

23
00:01:30,657 --> 00:01:32,826
A thin what?

24
00:01:34,127 --> 00:01:36,729
Clothes, clothes, clothes.

25
00:01:36,729 --> 00:01:40,633
"Niked"-- not wearing no thin
clothes.

26
00:01:40,633 --> 00:01:42,368
Nah, me either.

27
00:01:42,368 --> 00:01:44,971
Uh-huh, same old one.

28
00:01:46,706 --> 00:01:48,875
Same old one here, too.

29
00:01:48,875 --> 00:01:50,610
What are they talking about?

30
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:52,779
I don't know, but whatever it is,

31
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:54,514
ours aren't young enough.

32
00:01:54,514 --> 00:01:56,683
We were just teasing you, honey,
because you said

33
00:01:57,117 --> 00:01:59,719
you were going to go in and put on a
new face, and you didn't.

34
00:01:59,719 --> 00:02:01,888
Oh, Ethel, did you ever wish

35
00:02:01,888 --> 00:02:05,358
there was something else to marry
besides men?

36
00:02:05,358 --> 00:02:06,659
Often.

37
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:08,394
Well, what are we gonna do tonight

38
00:02:08,394 --> 00:02:10,997
besides sit around and sneer at each
other?

39
00:02:10,997 --> 00:02:13,166
Shall I look in the paper?

40
00:02:13,166 --> 00:02:14,033
Yeah.

41
00:02:14,033 --> 00:02:15,335
I better call Jerry.

42
00:02:15,335 --> 00:02:17,070
Wouldn't it be quicker to look in the
paper?

43
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:19,239
This is for something else.

44
00:02:19,239 --> 00:02:20,106
Oh.

45
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:23,576
I'm having some trouble finding some
apache dancers for my show.

46
00:02:23,576 --> 00:02:25,311
Apache dancers?

47
00:02:25,311 --> 00:02:26,179
Yeah.

48
00:02:26,613 --> 00:02:29,215
(hooting)

49
00:02:30,517 --> 00:02:31,384
Lucy.

50
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:32,685
Lucy!

51
00:02:32,685 --> 00:02:33,553
What?

52
00:02:33,553 --> 00:02:34,854
Not that kind, honey.

53
00:02:34,854 --> 00:02:36,589
It's for the Parisian number.
Oh.

54
00:02:36,589 --> 00:02:37,891
The French kind.

55
00:02:37,891 --> 00:02:39,192
A French Indian?

56
00:02:39,192 --> 00:02:40,493
Oui, oui.

57
00:02:40,493 --> 00:02:41,361
Oui, oui

58
00:02:41,361 --> 00:02:42,228
Oui, oui

59
00:02:42,228 --> 00:02:43,530
Oui, oui...

60
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:44,397
No, no, Lucy.

61
00:02:44,397 --> 00:02:46,132
You know, where the tough Frenchman

62
00:02:46,132 --> 00:02:48,735
grabs the girl by the hair and throws
her over his shoulder

63
00:02:48,735 --> 00:02:50,904
and slams her down on the floor and
steps on her.

64
00:02:50,904 --> 00:02:52,639
Oh!

65
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:53,506
Oh.

66
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:56,109
(humming tango)

67
00:02:58,711 --> 00:03:01,748
(squawking melodramatically)

68
00:03:06,085 --> 00:03:07,820
(gasping)

69
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:08,688
Wait.

70
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:09,989
Oh!

71
00:03:09,989 --> 00:03:13,459
Ah-ah-ahhhh!

72
00:03:13,459 --> 00:03:15,628
(gasping and yelling)

73
00:03:15,628 --> 00:03:16,930
Lucy.

74
00:03:17,363 --> 00:03:18,665
Lucy.

75
00:03:18,665 --> 00:03:20,400
Lucy!

76
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,267
What?

77
00:03:21,267 --> 00:03:23,002
I got your message.

78
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:26,039
You want to be in the show, right?

79
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:27,340
Right.

80
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:29,509
And you think you can do the dance,
right?

81
00:03:29,509 --> 00:03:30,810
Right.

82
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:32,979
Well, honey, you don't have to go
into all this routines.

83
00:03:32,979 --> 00:03:34,280
I don't?

84
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,148
No, honey.

85
00:03:35,148 --> 00:03:37,750
All you have to do is just come out
and ask me--

86
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:39,919
"Ricky, can I be in the show?"

87
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:40,787
Really?

88
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:42,088
Of course.

89
00:03:42,088 --> 00:03:44,257
Ricky, can I be in the show?

90
00:03:44,257 --> 00:03:45,992
No.

91
00:03:47,293 --> 00:03:48,161
Jerry.
You're mean.

92
00:03:48,161 --> 00:03:49,896
You didn't even let me finish the
audition.

93
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:51,197
Hold on a minute, Jerry, will you?

94
00:03:51,197 --> 00:03:52,498
You give everybody else a chance...

95
00:03:52,498 --> 00:03:53,800
What do you mean, "what's going on?"

96
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,101
My wife is acting crazy again, Jerry.

97
00:03:55,535 --> 00:03:57,704
Now, look, you just hold on like I
told you to do, Jerry--

98
00:03:58,137 --> 00:03:59,439
just wait a minute.

99
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:01,608
iAy, que barbaridad!

100
00:04:01,608 --> 00:04:03,776
(yelling gibberish)

101
00:04:05,511 --> 00:04:07,247
Relax, Lucy, relax.

102
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:08,548
Oh, he makes me so mad.

103
00:04:08,548 --> 00:04:09,849
There are just two things

104
00:04:09,849 --> 00:04:12,018
keeping me from dancing in that show.

105
00:04:12,018 --> 00:04:13,319
Your feet?

106
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:14,621
No.

107
00:04:14,621 --> 00:04:17,223
A partner and some rehearsal.

108
00:04:17,223 --> 00:04:20,260
It's a wonderful opportunity for
somebody.

109
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,127
Even if you had a partner,

110
00:04:21,127 --> 00:04:22,428
Ricky wouldn't hire you.

111
00:04:22,428 --> 00:04:23,730
Well, you heard what he said.

112
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:25,465
He's having trouble finding somebody.

113
00:04:25,465 --> 00:04:27,634
Maybe if I had a partner and we were
really good,

114
00:04:28,067 --> 00:04:29,369
Ricky couldn't turn me down.

115
00:04:29,369 --> 00:04:32,839
It's a wonderful opportunity for...
somebody.

116
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:34,574
Yeah, but who?

117
00:04:34,574 --> 00:04:35,875
Well...

118
00:04:35,875 --> 00:04:36,743
Gee, I wonder

119
00:04:37,176 --> 00:04:40,647
what Fred Astaire is doing these
days.

120
00:04:45,852 --> 00:04:47,153
Lucy.

121
00:04:47,153 --> 00:04:48,454
Coming.

122
00:04:49,322 --> 00:04:51,057
Hi, Ethel.

123
00:04:51,057 --> 00:04:52,358
Hi.

124
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:56,262
Uh...

125
00:04:56,262 --> 00:04:57,563
(chuckles nervously)

126
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:01,034
Something on your mind, Ethel?

127
00:05:01,034 --> 00:05:02,769
No... yes.

128
00:05:02,769 --> 00:05:04,937
Well, that covers the territory
pretty well.

129
00:05:04,937 --> 00:05:06,673
Lucy, were you serious last night

130
00:05:06,673 --> 00:05:09,275
about finding that partner for the
apache dance?

131
00:05:09,275 --> 00:05:10,143
I certainly was.

132
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:12,745
Well, I've got him for you-- Fred.

133
00:05:12,745 --> 00:05:14,047
Fred!

134
00:05:14,047 --> 00:05:15,348
Astaire!

135
00:05:17,083 --> 00:05:18,384
Ta-da!

136
00:05:24,891 --> 00:05:26,192
Oh, Mertz.

137
00:05:26,192 --> 00:05:29,228
Now, Lucy, before you make up your
mind, listen.

138
00:05:29,228 --> 00:05:31,397
Fred used to be a headliner in
vaudeville.

139
00:05:31,397 --> 00:05:32,699
Why, he can dance circles

140
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:34,867
around any of the younger men today.

141
00:05:34,867 --> 00:05:37,036
He's the king of the apache dancers.

142
00:05:37,036 --> 00:05:38,338
There, I said it.

143
00:05:38,771 --> 00:05:40,506
Do I get my new hat?

144
00:05:40,506 --> 00:05:41,374
Yes.

145
00:05:41,374 --> 00:05:43,976
Well, thanks a lot, Fred, but I don't
think...

146
00:05:43,976 --> 00:05:46,145
Oh, now, listen, Lucy.
He's really not half bad.

147
00:05:46,145 --> 00:05:47,447
He might work out fine.

148
00:05:47,447 --> 00:05:48,748
Why don't you give him a chance?

149
00:05:48,748 --> 00:05:50,049
Yeah.

150
00:05:50,049 --> 00:05:50,917
Well, all right.

151
00:05:50,917 --> 00:05:54,387
I suppose a fat apache is better than
none.

152
00:05:54,387 --> 00:05:56,556
ETHEL: Okay, you're on your own.

153
00:05:56,556 --> 00:05:57,857
See you later.

154
00:05:57,857 --> 00:05:58,725
Bye.

155
00:05:58,725 --> 00:06:00,893
Now we can start rehearsing, huh?

156
00:06:00,893 --> 00:06:02,195
Oh, all right.

157
00:06:03,496 --> 00:06:05,231
Now, let's get going.

158
00:06:05,665 --> 00:06:07,400
Well, I don't know much about this,
but...

159
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,135
Well, I'm gonna show you-- now, here.

160
00:06:09,135 --> 00:06:11,304
Put your hands together behind your
back.

161
00:06:11,304 --> 00:06:12,605
Put 'em up a little higher.

162
00:06:12,605 --> 00:06:15,208
Now turn around.

163
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:18,244
Now... Now we face each other and
look in each other's eyes.

164
00:06:20,847 --> 00:06:21,714
Where are you?

165
00:06:21,714 --> 00:06:23,015
I'm down here.

166
00:06:23,015 --> 00:06:26,052
Well, it's impossible to look into
each other's eyes.

167
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:27,787
No, it isn't; we've got to do it.

168
00:06:27,787 --> 00:06:29,522
All apache dancers do it.

169
00:06:29,522 --> 00:06:31,691
Now, you come down a little and I'll
come up.

170
00:06:31,691 --> 00:06:32,992
All right.

171
00:06:34,293 --> 00:06:35,595
Hey... whoa...
right in there.

172
00:06:36,028 --> 00:06:36,896
Hold that.

173
00:06:36,896 --> 00:06:37,764
Yeah.

174
00:06:37,764 --> 00:06:40,366
Now we put our heads together.

175
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,403
Now stare in each other's eyes.

176
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:44,270
All right.

177
00:06:46,005 --> 00:06:47,740
Now we go forward.

178
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:48,608
Okay.

179
00:06:49,041 --> 00:06:49,909
Are you ready?

180
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:50,777
Yep.

181
00:06:50,777 --> 00:06:52,945
Da, da, da, de--

182
00:06:52,945 --> 00:06:55,548
(groaning)

183
00:06:55,548 --> 00:06:56,849
Forward, I said forward.

184
00:06:57,283 --> 00:06:58,151
I went forward.

185
00:06:58,151 --> 00:07:00,319
I mean I go forward and you go
backward.

186
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:01,621
Well, why didn't you say that?

187
00:07:01,621 --> 00:07:02,488
I did.

188
00:07:02,488 --> 00:07:03,790
You did not.

189
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:04,657
Now, don't argue with me.

190
00:07:04,657 --> 00:07:05,958
I'm the one who knows about this.

191
00:07:05,958 --> 00:07:07,260
All right.

192
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:08,561
Oh, come on, let's try it again.

193
00:07:08,995 --> 00:07:11,164
Put your hands behind your back.

194
00:07:11,164 --> 00:07:12,031
All right.

195
00:07:12,031 --> 00:07:13,766
Now, turn around.

196
00:07:13,766 --> 00:07:16,369
Now, put our heads together.

197
00:07:16,369 --> 00:07:17,236
All right.

198
00:07:17,236 --> 00:07:18,538
Look in each other's eyes.

199
00:07:18,538 --> 00:07:19,839
Okay.

200
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:20,706
Now, are you ready?

201
00:07:20,706 --> 00:07:21,574
Yeah.

202
00:07:21,574 --> 00:07:24,610
Da, da, da...

203
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:27,213
Da, da, da, da da, da dum-- bam

204
00:07:27,647 --> 00:07:31,551
Da, da, da...

205
00:07:31,551 --> 00:07:34,153
Da, da, da, da da, da dum-- bam

206
00:07:34,153 --> 00:07:36,322
(groaning)

207
00:07:38,925 --> 00:07:40,660
Oh, Fred, I'm sorry.

208
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:41,961
You're sorry.

209
00:07:41,961 --> 00:07:43,262
Yeah, that helps a lot.

210
00:07:43,262 --> 00:07:46,299
Fred, I'll be careful next time.

211
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:48,468
Try it yourself this time, will you?

212
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:49,335
All right.

213
00:07:49,335 --> 00:07:51,938
All right, now, put your hands behind
your back.

214
00:07:51,938 --> 00:07:52,805
All right.

215
00:07:52,805 --> 00:07:54,974
All right, now.

216
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:55,842
(yells)

217
00:07:55,842 --> 00:07:57,143
Stand still, will you?

218
00:07:57,577 --> 00:07:58,444
All right, yeah.

219
00:07:58,444 --> 00:07:59,312
Are you ready?

220
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:00,179
Yeah.

221
00:08:00,179 --> 00:08:02,782
Da, da, da...

222
00:08:02,782 --> 00:08:06,252
Da, da, da, da da, da dum-- bam

223
00:08:06,252 --> 00:08:08,855
Da, da, da...

224
00:08:08,855 --> 00:08:11,457
Da, da, da, da da, da dum-- bam

225
00:08:11,457 --> 00:08:15,361
(groaning)

226
00:08:15,361 --> 00:08:19,265
I guess I dah-ed when I should have
dum-ed.

227
00:08:19,265 --> 00:08:20,132
Yeah.

228
00:08:20,132 --> 00:08:22,301
Oh, Fred, I'm sorry.

229
00:08:22,301 --> 00:08:25,338
You're sorry and I'm crippled.

230
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:27,073
Oh, come on, let's go on from here.

231
00:08:27,073 --> 00:08:28,808
Let's try something else.

232
00:08:28,808 --> 00:08:29,675
Okay.
Here.

233
00:08:29,675 --> 00:08:31,410
Now I grab you by the wrist

234
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:33,145
and hurl you to the floor.

235
00:08:33,145 --> 00:08:34,447
What?

236
00:08:34,447 --> 00:08:37,917
I grab you by the wrist and hurl you
to the floor.

237
00:08:37,917 --> 00:08:39,218
Okay.

238
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:46,158
I said I grab you by the wrist

239
00:08:46,592 --> 00:08:48,327
and hurl you to the floor.

240
00:08:48,327 --> 00:08:49,195
Okay.

241
00:08:52,231 --> 00:08:53,533
What's the matter with you?

242
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:54,834
Are you nailed down?

243
00:08:56,135 --> 00:08:58,738
Well, Fred, maybe you weren't doing
it right.

244
00:08:58,738 --> 00:09:01,340
Now, you said you take me by the
wrist

245
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:03,075
and you hurl me to the floor.

246
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:06,546
Is that what you mean?

247
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:08,281
Yes, that's exactly what I mean.

248
00:09:08,281 --> 00:09:10,449
But there's a little bug in it
someplace.

249
00:09:10,449 --> 00:09:12,184
We've got to figure out

250
00:09:12,184 --> 00:09:14,787
how to get you down here and me up
there.

251
00:09:14,787 --> 00:09:15,655
Lucy!
What?

252
00:09:15,655 --> 00:09:17,390
Lucy, I've got the most wonderful
news.

253
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:18,257
What?

254
00:09:18,691 --> 00:09:20,426
Well, this is going to cost me a new
hat,

255
00:09:20,426 --> 00:09:22,161
but I found the perfect partner for
you.

256
00:09:22,161 --> 00:09:23,029
Really? Who?

257
00:09:23,029 --> 00:09:24,330
I'm sorry, Fred,

258
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:26,499
but I'm about to dethrone you

259
00:09:26,499 --> 00:09:28,668
as king of the apache dancers.

260
00:09:28,668 --> 00:09:30,403
You're a little late.

261
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:31,704
I've just abdicated.

262
00:09:33,873 --> 00:09:34,740
Who was it?

263
00:09:35,174 --> 00:09:36,909
The owner of the French laundry has a
nephew

264
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:39,512
who just got here from Paris, and
he's an apache dancer.

265
00:09:39,512 --> 00:09:41,247
Really?
What's his name?

266
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:44,717
His name is-- now, I want to say it

267
00:09:44,717 --> 00:09:46,018
just like he did--

268
00:09:46,018 --> 00:09:49,055
his name is Jean-Valjean Raymond.

269
00:09:49,488 --> 00:09:52,091
(nasally): Onh?

270
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:55,561
Jean-Valjean Raymond.

271
00:09:55,561 --> 00:09:58,164
Jean-Valjean Raymond.

272
00:09:58,598 --> 00:09:59,465
Onh.
Onh.

273
00:09:59,465 --> 00:10:01,634
I asked him to come over here this
afternoon.

274
00:10:01,634 --> 00:10:02,935
Is that all right?
Yeah, that's wonderful.

275
00:10:02,935 --> 00:10:05,104
Ricky will be at rehearsal all day.

276
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:06,839
Oh, I envy you spending all afternoon

277
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:08,574
with a romantic Frenchman.

278
00:10:08,574 --> 00:10:10,309
Oh, Ethel, don't be silly.

279
00:10:10,309 --> 00:10:12,044
This is strictly business.

280
00:10:12,044 --> 00:10:13,346
Onh?

281
00:10:13,346 --> 00:10:14,647
Onh.

282
00:10:16,382 --> 00:10:20,286
(doorbell buzzing)

283
00:10:25,491 --> 00:10:26,792
Madame Ricardo?

284
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:28,094
Yes?

285
00:10:28,094 --> 00:10:29,829
I am Jean-Valjean Raymond.

286
00:10:29,829 --> 00:10:31,130
Oh!

287
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:33,733
Won't you come in, please?

288
00:10:33,733 --> 00:10:36,335
It was so good of you to come this
afternoon.

289
00:10:36,335 --> 00:10:37,203
(gasps)

290
00:10:37,203 --> 00:10:38,504
What's the matter?

291
00:10:38,504 --> 00:10:39,372
Oh, madame.

292
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:41,974
But you have such a beautiful hand!

293
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:43,275
Oh, really?

294
00:10:43,275 --> 00:10:46,312
Well, I have another one just like
it.

295
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:53,686
Please, we better get to the dancing.

296
00:10:53,686 --> 00:10:56,288
Oh, but you don't understand, madame.

297
00:10:56,722 --> 00:10:59,325
The apache dance is a dance of amour.

298
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:01,060
One must warm up to it.

299
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:03,229
Yeah, well, I think you started
warming up

300
00:11:03,229 --> 00:11:04,530
on the way over here.

301
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:06,265
I can't help it.

302
00:11:06,265 --> 00:11:07,566
I can't help it.

303
00:11:07,566 --> 00:11:09,301
There's a pounding in my heart.

304
00:11:09,301 --> 00:11:12,338
You don't watch out, there'll be a
pounding on your head.

305
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:14,073
Lucy, Ricky's coming.

306
00:11:14,073 --> 00:11:14,940
Ricky?!

307
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:16,676
I just saw him coming up the front
stairs.

308
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:17,543
Oh, no! Quickly, quickly!

309
00:11:17,543 --> 00:11:18,844
Vite?
My husband.

310
00:11:18,844 --> 00:11:20,579
Oh, vite!

311
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:22,748
Here, here.

312
00:11:33,159 --> 00:11:34,026
Hi, honey.

313
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:35,327
Oh!

314
00:11:35,327 --> 00:11:36,195
Oh, hello, Ricky.

315
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:37,930
What are you doing here?

316
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:39,665
I live here, remember?

317
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:44,437
I mean, what are you doing home in
the afternoon?

318
00:11:44,437 --> 00:11:45,738
Oh, I forgot this music, honey.

319
00:11:45,738 --> 00:11:46,605
I need it for rehearsal.

320
00:11:46,605 --> 00:11:50,943
Oh, gee, it's a shame you can't stay
for a minute.

321
00:11:50,943 --> 00:11:53,546
Oh, I guess I can stay a minute or
two.

322
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:55,281
Oh, no, no, you better go.

323
00:11:55,281 --> 00:11:57,450
What's the matter with you?

324
00:11:57,883 --> 00:12:00,052
Well, I guess I'm just excited

325
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:04,390
because you're...
h-home in the afternoon.

326
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:06,125
Well!

327
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:08,294
If you're going to get that excited,

328
00:12:08,294 --> 00:12:09,595
I should never leave.

329
00:12:09,595 --> 00:12:11,764
(squawking)

330
00:12:14,366 --> 00:12:15,668
I'll see you tonight.

331
00:12:15,668 --> 00:12:16,969
Oh, good-bye, dear.

332
00:12:16,969 --> 00:12:19,572
I better get my hat; it looks like
rain.

333
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:20,873
Oh, I'll get it, I'll get it.

334
00:12:20,873 --> 00:12:22,608
All right, thank you.

335
00:12:27,813 --> 00:12:28,681
There.

336
00:12:28,681 --> 00:12:29,982
Thank you, honey.

337
00:12:29,982 --> 00:12:31,717
Maybe I should take an umbrella, too.

338
00:12:31,717 --> 00:12:33,886
Oh, I'll get it, I'll get it.

339
00:12:33,886 --> 00:12:35,621
No, I guess not.

340
00:12:38,657 --> 00:12:41,694
Still, I hate to get soaked on the
way down to the club.

341
00:12:41,694 --> 00:12:43,863
Ah, the heck with it.

342
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:48,200
I'll see you tonight, honey.

343
00:12:50,369 --> 00:12:51,670
(sighs)

344
00:12:53,405 --> 00:12:54,273
Is he gone?

345
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:55,574
Huh?

346
00:12:55,574 --> 00:12:56,876
Your husband, is he gone?

347
00:12:56,876 --> 00:12:58,177
Oh, yes, he's gone.

348
00:12:58,177 --> 00:13:03,382
Oh, ma cherie, now I know how you
really feel about me.

349
00:13:03,382 --> 00:13:04,683
Kiss me!

350
00:13:04,683 --> 00:13:05,551
No!

351
00:13:05,551 --> 00:13:07,286
Why are you American women

352
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:08,154
so stubborn?

353
00:13:08,154 --> 00:13:10,322
Why are you Frenchmen so amorous?

354
00:13:10,322 --> 00:13:12,057
I don't know.

355
00:13:12,057 --> 00:13:15,094
Just fortunate, I guess.

356
00:13:16,395 --> 00:13:17,263
Kiss me.

357
00:13:17,263 --> 00:13:18,130
No!

358
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:20,299
But if all you wanted me was to dance
with you,

359
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:23,335
why did you hide me from your
husband?

360
00:13:23,335 --> 00:13:25,070
Because I want to get a job dancing
in his show

361
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:27,673
and I don't want him to know that I'm
rehearsing with you.

362
00:13:27,673 --> 00:13:30,276
Am I not romantic to you?

363
00:13:30,709 --> 00:13:32,444
Yes, you are not romantic to me.

364
00:13:32,444 --> 00:13:33,746
Now, please go.

365
00:13:33,746 --> 00:13:34,613
Very well.

366
00:13:34,613 --> 00:13:36,348
I shall go.

367
00:13:36,348 --> 00:13:37,650
Thank goodness.

368
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:39,819
But...
I shall return

369
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:42,855
and I shall look for ways

370
00:13:42,855 --> 00:13:46,325
to make myself more romantic

371
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:49,795
in your beautiful, big, blue eyes.

372
00:13:49,795 --> 00:13:51,964
Ewww...

373
00:13:56,302 --> 00:13:58,470
Vive la romance.

374
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:02,374
Well!

375
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:23,195
What are you doing, dear?

376
00:14:23,195 --> 00:14:24,496
Oh, just getting comfortable.

377
00:14:24,496 --> 00:14:26,232
Put your shoe back on.

378
00:14:26,232 --> 00:14:29,702
I promised the Mertzes we'd go to the
movies with them tonight.

379
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:31,437
They'll be up in a few minutes.

380
00:14:31,437 --> 00:14:33,172
Oh... all right.

381
00:14:34,907 --> 00:14:35,774
Lucy?

382
00:14:35,774 --> 00:14:38,811
Yes, dear, you have to shave.

383
00:14:38,811 --> 00:14:40,546
Shave, shave, shave.

384
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:44,016
All this shaving is liable to wear my
chin away.

385
00:14:44,016 --> 00:14:46,185
Okay, Andy Gump.

386
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:05,704
Shh! shh!

387
00:15:05,704 --> 00:15:07,006
What are you doing here?

388
00:15:07,006 --> 00:15:09,174
Oh, this is more romantic.

389
00:15:09,174 --> 00:15:10,910
We will elope together.

390
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:12,645
Elope? Are you out of your mind?

391
00:15:12,645 --> 00:15:13,946
Now, get out of here.

392
00:15:13,946 --> 00:15:14,813
No, please don't.

393
00:15:14,813 --> 00:15:16,115
Oh!

394
00:15:16,115 --> 00:15:17,850
(yelling)

395
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:20,452
(crashing)

396
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,621
What happened?

397
00:15:22,621 --> 00:15:26,091
The ladder-- she went down without
me.

398
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:28,260
Fine, now what are you going to do?

399
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:29,561
RICKY: Lucy?

400
00:15:29,995 --> 00:15:31,297
(yells)

401
00:15:31,297 --> 00:15:32,164
Shh!

402
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:33,465
Lucy?

403
00:15:33,465 --> 00:15:34,333
What is it?!

404
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:36,068
No hot water again.

405
00:15:36,068 --> 00:15:37,369
Did you tell Ethel

406
00:15:37,369 --> 00:15:39,104
to fix the hot- water heater?

407
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:40,406
Yes, I talked to her.

408
00:15:40,406 --> 00:15:42,141
Well, she better fix it

409
00:15:42,141 --> 00:15:43,442
or I'm going to move.

410
00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:45,177
I cut myself to pieces in here.

411
00:15:56,889 --> 00:16:00,359
Feels like I shaved with the top of a
tin can.

412
00:16:00,359 --> 00:16:01,660
Tin can?

413
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:02,528
Yeah.

414
00:16:03,829 --> 00:16:06,865
You know, it wouldn't be such a bad
idea to move, at that.

415
00:16:06,865 --> 00:16:10,336
How would you like to live in the
country and commute?

416
00:16:10,336 --> 00:16:11,637
Oh, I'd like that.

417
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:13,372
Uh, honey, you'd better go get your
shirt on.

418
00:16:13,372 --> 00:16:15,107
The Mertzes will be here any minute.

419
00:16:15,107 --> 00:16:16,842
Oh, we have lots of time.

420
00:16:16,842 --> 00:16:18,577
Want a cigarette?

421
00:16:18,577 --> 00:16:21,180
Yeah, light it for me, dear.

422
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:22,481
All right.

423
00:16:27,252 --> 00:16:28,120
Hey, look at me.

424
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:30,289
I'm making like Paul Henreid.

425
00:16:30,289 --> 00:16:32,024
(Lucy laughing stiffly)

426
00:16:34,193 --> 00:16:37,663
Uh, put it in my mouth, dear.

427
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:40,265
Do you want me to smoke it for you?

428
00:16:40,265 --> 00:16:42,868
You know, living in the country

429
00:16:42,868 --> 00:16:45,471
wouldn't be a bad idea at all

430
00:16:45,471 --> 00:16:48,507
with the trees and the flowers...

431
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:50,242
the birds singing...

432
00:16:50,242 --> 00:16:54,146
tweet-tweet, tweet-tweet,
tweet-tweet.

433
00:16:54,146 --> 00:16:56,315
Tweet-tweet.

434
00:16:56,315 --> 00:16:58,050
Where would you like to live,

435
00:16:58,050 --> 00:16:59,785
Long Island or Westchester?

436
00:16:59,785 --> 00:17:01,520
Westchester.

437
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,689
Yeah, you know,

438
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:05,858
it would be real wonderful

439
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:10,629
to be away from the crowd and the
noise and the nightclubs.

440
00:17:10,629 --> 00:17:12,364
And the smoke.

441
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:18,437
We could get a place in New Jersey.
That's nice...

442
00:17:18,437 --> 00:17:19,738
(Jean-Valjean yelling)

443
00:17:19,738 --> 00:17:20,606
What's that?

444
00:17:20,606 --> 00:17:21,907
What's that?

445
00:17:21,907 --> 00:17:23,642
Hey, there's a man out here!

446
00:17:23,642 --> 00:17:24,943
Hey, hold it now.

447
00:17:24,943 --> 00:17:26,245
Hold on.

448
00:17:26,245 --> 00:17:27,112
I'll get...

449
00:17:27,112 --> 00:17:29,281
Hold on, now, hold on.

450
00:17:29,281 --> 00:17:31,450
(sighing)

451
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:33,185
Oh, thank you, monsieur.

452
00:17:33,185 --> 00:17:35,354
I thought I was going to fall.

453
00:17:35,354 --> 00:17:37,523
Who are you, and what are you doing
outside that window?

454
00:17:37,523 --> 00:17:38,824
Yeah, how about that?

455
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:41,860
My ladder fell.

456
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:44,463
I came here to elope with madame.

457
00:17:44,463 --> 00:17:46,198
Elope! What's going on here?

458
00:17:46,198 --> 00:17:48,801
How can you say a thing like that?

459
00:17:48,801 --> 00:17:49,668
What do you mean you came here...?

460
00:17:49,668 --> 00:17:52,271
Please, please, this is no time to
argue.

461
00:17:52,271 --> 00:17:54,440
If we stay here much longer,

462
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:57,042
her stupid husband will return

463
00:17:57,042 --> 00:17:58,343
and find us here.

464
00:17:58,343 --> 00:18:00,079
Watch what you're saying!

465
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:01,814
He's my stupid husband!

466
00:18:01,814 --> 00:18:03,115
He's my husband.

467
00:18:03,115 --> 00:18:05,284
All right, you, now you tell me
what's going on

468
00:18:05,717 --> 00:18:07,453
or I'll punch you right in the nose.

469
00:18:07,453 --> 00:18:08,320
(yelling)

470
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:12,224
Don't try to get away, you gigolo!

471
00:18:12,224 --> 00:18:13,092
Gigolo!

472
00:18:13,525 --> 00:18:15,260
I am very insulted.

473
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:17,863
I challenge you to a duel.

474
00:18:17,863 --> 00:18:19,164
LUCY: A duel!

475
00:18:20,466 --> 00:18:23,068
You got yourself a deal, brother.

476
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:25,237
Very well.

477
00:18:25,237 --> 00:18:27,840
Tomorrow at dawn

478
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:30,442
behind Radio City Music Hall.

479
00:18:32,177 --> 00:18:34,346
What do you mean, "tomorrow at dawn

480
00:18:34,346 --> 00:18:36,515
behind Radio City Music Hall"?

481
00:18:36,515 --> 00:18:38,250
Right now-- I'm ready now.

482
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:39,118
Very well.

483
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:40,419
I challenge you.

484
00:18:40,419 --> 00:18:42,588
You choose the weapons.

485
00:18:42,588 --> 00:18:45,190
These are good enough for me,
brother.

486
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:46,058
Put 'em up.
Come on.

487
00:18:46,058 --> 00:18:46,925
Ricky, Ricky.

488
00:18:46,925 --> 00:18:49,528
Please, please, please-- too crude.

489
00:18:49,528 --> 00:18:51,697
Very vulgar.
It must be pistols.

490
00:18:51,697 --> 00:18:52,564
"Pee-stoles"?

491
00:18:52,564 --> 00:18:53,866
"Pee-stoles"?

492
00:18:55,601 --> 00:18:57,769
Who's got any "pee-stoles"?

493
00:18:57,769 --> 00:19:01,240
I'll hit you on top of the head with
a conga drum, you bum.

494
00:19:02,541 --> 00:19:06,011
Qu'est-ce que c'est "conga drum, you
bum"?

495
00:19:06,011 --> 00:19:08,614
Well, it's a long...

496
00:19:08,614 --> 00:19:09,915
and it's...

497
00:19:09,915 --> 00:19:11,216
and you...

498
00:19:11,216 --> 00:19:12,951
It'll hurt you.

499
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:15,120
It must be pistols.

500
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:17,723
Where are we going to get pistols?

501
00:19:17,723 --> 00:19:19,892
I have such a terrible temper

502
00:19:19,892 --> 00:19:21,627
that I always carry with me

503
00:19:21,627 --> 00:19:22,928
dueling pistols.

504
00:19:22,928 --> 00:19:23,795
Oh, no.
Oh, no!

505
00:19:23,795 --> 00:19:25,097
Okay, that's good enough for me.

506
00:19:25,097 --> 00:19:27,699
Ricky, you don't know what you're
doing.

507
00:19:27,699 --> 00:19:29,868
Come on, honey, this is liable to be
a bit messy.

508
00:19:29,868 --> 00:19:31,170
Ricky, I'm not worth it.

509
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:32,471
I'm not worth it.
Out.

510
00:19:32,471 --> 00:19:34,206
I'm not worth it.
Out! Out!

511
00:19:34,206 --> 00:19:36,375
All right, I'm ready.

512
00:19:36,375 --> 00:19:38,544
Where did you go?

513
00:19:38,544 --> 00:19:39,845
Hey, Frenchy!

514
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:41,146
All right.

515
00:19:42,447 --> 00:19:46,351
Please, put that thing away before
you kill somebody.

516
00:19:46,785 --> 00:19:48,954
You mean we're not going to duel?

517
00:19:48,954 --> 00:19:50,255
I hope not.

518
00:19:50,255 --> 00:19:51,557
Whew!

519
00:19:51,557 --> 00:19:55,027
That's the closest I've ever been to
a duel

520
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:56,328
in my whole life.

521
00:19:56,328 --> 00:19:58,497
Me, too.

522
00:19:58,931 --> 00:20:01,099
What do you mean, "me, too"?

523
00:20:01,099 --> 00:20:02,401
It was a bum steer.

524
00:20:02,401 --> 00:20:04,570
I was told that it was safe

525
00:20:05,003 --> 00:20:07,172
to challenge people over here

526
00:20:07,172 --> 00:20:10,642
because American men would be afraid
to duel.

527
00:20:11,076 --> 00:20:12,377
American men, eh?

528
00:20:14,112 --> 00:20:18,016
I guess I fooled you with my Brooklyn
accent, eh?

529
00:20:20,185 --> 00:20:24,523
I guess I made what you call a
boo-boo.

530
00:20:24,523 --> 00:20:25,824
I guess you did.

531
00:20:25,824 --> 00:20:27,559
What about all this stuff

532
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:29,294
about eloping with my wife?

533
00:20:29,294 --> 00:20:31,029
Is that another, uh... boo-boo?

534
00:20:31,029 --> 00:20:32,331
Oh, super-size.

535
00:20:32,331 --> 00:20:35,367
I was also told that American women

536
00:20:35,367 --> 00:20:38,403
expect Frenchmen to be romantic.

537
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:41,440
I have a wife and five children of my
own.

538
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,609
Then what are you doing here?

539
00:20:43,609 --> 00:20:45,777
I came here to be your wife's dance
partner

540
00:20:46,211 --> 00:20:47,512
in the apache dance.

541
00:20:47,512 --> 00:20:49,248
Oh.

542
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:51,850
Ohhh...

543
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:54,886
Oh, I smell a red-headed rat.

544
00:20:56,622 --> 00:20:59,224
I tell you what we're going to do,
amigo.

545
00:20:59,224 --> 00:21:00,525
This thing loaded?

546
00:21:00,525 --> 00:21:01,393
But yes.

547
00:21:01,393 --> 00:21:02,694
Ay!

548
00:21:02,694 --> 00:21:04,863
We're going to teach my wife a lesson

549
00:21:04,863 --> 00:21:06,598
she will never forget.

550
00:21:06,598 --> 00:21:08,333
You and I are going to do...

551
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:13,105
Well, we're ready to go to the
movies.

552
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:14,406
Lucy...
(yells)

553
00:21:14,406 --> 00:21:15,274
what's the matter?

554
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:17,442
They're in there.
They're going to fight a duel.

555
00:21:17,442 --> 00:21:18,310
A duel!
Yes!

556
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:19,177
Who's dueling?

557
00:21:19,611 --> 00:21:20,912
Did he come back?

558
00:21:20,912 --> 00:21:22,214
Yes!
Who's dueling?

559
00:21:22,214 --> 00:21:23,081
How did it happen?

560
00:21:23,081 --> 00:21:24,816
He called him a gigolo.

561
00:21:24,816 --> 00:21:26,118
Who's dueling?

562
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:26,985
Swords?

563
00:21:26,985 --> 00:21:28,287
Pistols.

564
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:29,154
Who's dueling?

565
00:21:29,154 --> 00:21:30,889
Ricky and Jean-Valjean Raymond.

566
00:21:30,889 --> 00:21:33,492
All four of them?

567
00:21:33,492 --> 00:21:35,227
(gunshots)

568
00:21:37,396 --> 00:21:39,131
(wailing)

569
00:21:39,998 --> 00:21:41,300
(gunshots stop)

570
00:21:45,203 --> 00:21:47,372
LUCY: Oh, no.

571
00:21:50,409 --> 00:21:53,879
Sorry, madame, c'est la vie.

572
00:21:53,879 --> 00:21:55,614
Is he...?

573
00:21:59,084 --> 00:22:01,687
Oh, Ricky!

574
00:22:01,687 --> 00:22:02,988
Don't, madame.

575
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:04,289
It isn't a pretty sight.

576
00:22:04,289 --> 00:22:05,590
(wailing)

577
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:09,061
Oh, this is all my fault.

578
00:22:09,061 --> 00:22:10,796
I killed him.

579
00:22:10,796 --> 00:22:12,531
Oh, you poor little thing.

580
00:22:12,531 --> 00:22:13,832
No, you didn't.
He did.

581
00:22:13,832 --> 00:22:16,868
You... you crepe suzette.

582
00:22:19,471 --> 00:22:21,640
If I hadn't wanted to do that apache
dance,

583
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:22,941
this never would have happened.

584
00:22:23,375 --> 00:22:25,977
Oh, if I only had it to do over
again,

585
00:22:25,977 --> 00:22:29,881
I'd just be happy being Mrs. Ricky
Ricardo.

586
00:22:29,881 --> 00:22:33,785
Oh, Ethel, if I only had another
chance.

587
00:22:35,954 --> 00:22:36,822
All right

588
00:22:36,822 --> 00:22:38,557
I'll give you one more chance.

589
00:22:38,557 --> 00:22:40,292
Ricky!

590
00:22:40,292 --> 00:22:42,027
Ricky, you're all right.

591
00:22:42,461 --> 00:22:44,196
Oh, sure I'm all right.

592
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:46,798
Honey, what happened?

593
00:22:46,798 --> 00:22:50,268
We both made a boo-boo.

594
00:22:50,268 --> 00:22:52,003
Oh, yoo-hoo.

595
00:22:54,172 --> 00:22:56,341
Vive la romance.

596
00:23:01,113 --> 00:23:04,149
Oh, honey, you should have seen your
face

597
00:23:04,583 --> 00:23:06,752
when I popped out of that room.

598
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:09,354
Well, you scared me out of ten years'
growth.

599
00:23:09,354 --> 00:23:12,391
Oh, well, honey, I just wanted to
teach you a lesson.

600
00:23:12,391 --> 00:23:13,692
That's all.

601
00:23:13,692 --> 00:23:16,294
Yeah, I guess I had it coming to me.

602
00:23:16,294 --> 00:23:18,029
Well, good night, baby.

603
00:23:18,029 --> 00:23:19,765
Good night, sweetheart.

604
00:23:26,271 --> 00:23:28,440
(sighing)

605
00:23:47,526 --> 00:23:49,261
(yells)

606
00:23:55,333 --> 00:23:57,936
Hey! what's that for?!

607
00:23:57,936 --> 00:23:59,237
Well, I've just been thinking it
over.

608
00:23:59,237 --> 00:24:00,539
That wasn't funny at all.

609
00:24:00,539 --> 00:24:02,274
That was a terrible thing to do to
me.

610
00:24:02,274 --> 00:24:04,009
How could you play such a dirty trick

611
00:24:04,009 --> 00:24:05,744
when you know the effect it would
have on me?

612
00:24:06,178 --> 00:24:09,214
Of all the inconsiderate, no-good,
lowdown...

613
00:24:09,214 --> 00:24:10,949
I don't think that I'll ever

614
00:24:10,949 --> 00:24:12,684
speak to you again.

615

Captioned by Media Access Group at
WGBH access.wgbh.org

616
00:24:34,806 --> 00:24:38,710
The part of Jean-Valjean Raymond was
played by Jeff Mencken.

617
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:07,772
I Love Lucy is a Desilu Production.


1
00:00:36,069 --> 00:00:38,237
Ha, ha, that's it, partner.

2
00:00:38,237 --> 00:00:39,972
Game and rubber.

3
00:00:39,972 --> 00:00:41,274
How do you like that, Ricky?

4
00:00:41,274 --> 00:00:42,575
We didn't take a single trick.

5
00:00:42,575 --> 00:00:45,611
Yeah. Fortunately, you only bid six
spades-- double.

6
00:00:45,611 --> 00:00:46,913
Oh...

7
00:00:46,913 --> 00:00:50,383
When I was leading diamonds and you
didn't have any diamonds,

8
00:00:50,383 --> 00:00:52,118
why didn't you play trumps?

9
00:00:52,118 --> 00:00:52,985
I didn't have any trumps.

10
00:00:52,985 --> 00:00:54,287
I thought you knew that.

11
00:00:54,287 --> 00:00:56,889
Why do you think I was kicking you
under the table?

12
00:00:56,889 --> 00:00:58,191
You didn't kick me.

13
00:00:58,191 --> 00:00:59,926
Well, then, who did I kick?

14
00:00:59,926 --> 00:01:02,528
Is there any liniment in the house?

15
00:01:03,396 --> 00:01:05,131
Oh, Fred, I'm sorry.

16
00:01:05,131 --> 00:01:07,300
I didn't know I was kicking you.

17
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:08,601
Oh, I rather enjoyed it.

18
00:01:08,601 --> 00:01:11,204
I thought we were playing shinsies.

19
00:01:11,204 --> 00:01:13,806
Well, here it is.

20
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:19,879
14,625 points for us...
and 73 points for you.

21
00:01:19,879 --> 00:01:23,349
Let's see, you owe us 14,000... at,
uh...

22
00:01:23,349 --> 00:01:26,386
let's see five and carry two...

23
00:01:26,386 --> 00:01:28,121
85 cents.

24
00:01:30,723 --> 00:01:32,024
Pay them, Ricky.

25
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,495
I'll get my purse.

26
00:01:38,531 --> 00:01:39,399
(groans)

27
00:01:39,399 --> 00:01:42,001
Yeah, I've been sitting still too
long

28
00:01:42,001 --> 00:01:43,302
I'll tell you that.

29
00:01:43,302 --> 00:01:45,905
Oh, I have, too.

30
00:01:48,074 --> 00:01:49,809
"Shine On Harvest Moon"--

31
00:01:49,809 --> 00:01:51,544
what are you doing with this old
tune, Ricky?

32
00:01:51,544 --> 00:01:52,845
Oh, we're doing it in the show.

33
00:01:52,845 --> 00:01:54,580
You know, an old-fashioned June moon
number.

34
00:01:55,014 --> 00:01:55,882
Yeah?

35
00:01:55,882 --> 00:01:57,617
Here, sit down.

36
00:01:57,617 --> 00:01:58,484
Oh, sing, Ricky.

37
00:01:58,484 --> 00:01:59,352
All right.

38
00:01:59,352 --> 00:02:01,954
Oh, shine on...

39
00:02:01,954 --> 00:02:06,292
BOTH: Shine on harvest moon

40
00:02:06,292 --> 00:02:08,461
Up in the sky

41
00:02:08,461 --> 00:02:11,497
I ain't had no loving

42
00:02:11,497 --> 00:02:16,702
Since January, February, June or July

43
00:02:16,702 --> 00:02:18,004
Hey, Fred, you're pretty good.

44
00:02:18,004 --> 00:02:19,305
Aw, sure he is.

45
00:02:19,305 --> 00:02:20,606
Let's take it from the top again.

46
00:02:20,606 --> 00:02:21,908
All right.

47
00:02:21,908 --> 00:02:29,715
ALL: Oh, shine on, shine on, harvest
moon, up in the sky

48
00:02:29,715 --> 00:02:33,619
I ain't had no loving

49
00:02:34,053 --> 00:02:40,126
(Lucy screeching along:)
Since January, February, June or July

50
00:02:40,126 --> 00:02:42,728
Show time ain't no time

51
00:02:42,728 --> 00:02:45,331
To stay outdoors...

52
00:02:45,331 --> 00:02:47,066
And spoon

53
00:02:47,066 --> 00:02:49,669
Shine on...

54
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:50,970
Shine on...

55
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:52,271
Hold it, hold it!

56
00:02:52,271 --> 00:02:54,440
Hold it.

57
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:56,609
Somebody's singing off key.

58
00:02:56,609 --> 00:02:58,344
Yeah, watch that, will you?

59
00:02:58,344 --> 00:03:00,079
Somebody's singing off key.

60
00:03:02,248 --> 00:03:04,417
Well, who was it?

61
00:03:04,417 --> 00:03:06,152
Who was it?

62
00:03:06,152 --> 00:03:08,754
Well, there's only one way to find
out.

63
00:03:08,754 --> 00:03:10,490
Ahh.

64
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:11,791
Fred?

65
00:03:11,791 --> 00:03:13,526
Ahh.

66
00:03:13,526 --> 00:03:14,827
Ethel?

67
00:03:14,827 --> 00:03:16,128
Ahh.

68
00:03:16,128 --> 00:03:17,430
Lucy?

69
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:20,466
(off key): Ahh.

70
00:03:21,334 --> 00:03:25,238
At ease, mounties, we found our man.

71
00:03:25,238 --> 00:03:26,539
You have not.

72
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:28,274
I hit the right note.

73
00:03:28,274 --> 00:03:30,009
The piano needs tuning.

74
00:03:30,009 --> 00:03:32,612
Oh, honey, why don't you just go and
sit down

75
00:03:33,045 --> 00:03:35,214
and listen to the rest of us, huh?

76
00:03:35,214 --> 00:03:38,251
No, either we all sing or nobody
sings.

77
00:03:53,866 --> 00:03:55,601
Well, all right then.

78
00:03:55,601 --> 00:03:58,204
If nobody wants to sing, I'll just
sing by myself.

79
00:03:58,204 --> 00:03:59,939
ALL: No!

80
00:04:01,674 --> 00:04:05,144
Well, of all the insulting...

81
00:04:05,144 --> 00:04:06,445
Now, honey, come on.

82
00:04:06,445 --> 00:04:08,180
Fix us a snack, huh?
I'm hungry.

83
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:09,482
No, you can't insult me

84
00:04:09,482 --> 00:04:11,651
and then expect me to feed you.

85
00:04:11,651 --> 00:04:12,952
Oh, honey.

86
00:04:12,952 --> 00:04:15,121
Come on, Fred, let's see what's out
there.

87
00:04:15,555 --> 00:04:16,422
Coming, maestro.

88
00:04:16,422 --> 00:04:18,591
Oh, dear, I might just as well fix it
for them--

89
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:20,326
they'll just get the kitchen all
messy.

90
00:04:20,326 --> 00:04:22,495
No, wait a minute, Lucy, I want to
talk to you.

91
00:04:22,495 --> 00:04:23,362
What about?

92
00:04:23,362 --> 00:04:25,097
Well, come sit down.

93
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:27,700
You got to help me.

94
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:29,869
My women's club wants Ricky.

95
00:04:29,869 --> 00:04:32,038
Well, I'd be very glad to help them
out, Ethel,

96
00:04:32,038 --> 00:04:34,206
but I'm not through with him yet.

97
00:04:35,074 --> 00:04:37,677
No, I didn't mean that.

98
00:04:37,677 --> 00:04:38,978
I mean, we want him to sing

99
00:04:38,978 --> 00:04:41,147
at a benefit my club is giving next
week,

100
00:04:41,147 --> 00:04:42,882
and I can't get up the nerve to ask
him.

101
00:04:42,882 --> 00:04:43,749
You ask him.

102
00:04:43,749 --> 00:04:48,521
Well... how would you like to have
the both of us?

103
00:04:50,256 --> 00:04:52,858
Is that the only way we can get
Ricky?

104
00:04:52,858 --> 00:04:54,160
Never mind that.

105
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,762
Do you want us or don't you?

106
00:04:56,762 --> 00:04:58,497
Well...

107
00:04:58,497 --> 00:04:59,365
all right.

108
00:04:59,365 --> 00:05:01,100
Do you think you can get him to do
it?

109
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:02,401
Sure, if I wheedle him.

110
00:05:02,401 --> 00:05:04,136
How soon? I got to have the posters
printed

111
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:06,739
and the signs made for the front of
the theater, you know.

112
00:05:06,739 --> 00:05:08,908
You go ahead and have them made, I'll
work on Ricky.

113
00:05:08,908 --> 00:05:11,077
I'll start on him tonight just as
soon as you and Fred leave.

114
00:05:11,077 --> 00:05:13,679
Oh, good, we'll go right now.

115
00:05:13,679 --> 00:05:15,414
Fred?

116
00:05:15,414 --> 00:05:18,017
Come on, it's getting late.
We gotta go.

117
00:05:18,017 --> 00:05:18,884
But I'm hungry.

118
00:05:18,884 --> 00:05:20,186
Oh, come on.

119
00:05:20,186 --> 00:05:22,788
You can live off of that till
breakfast.

120
00:05:22,788 --> 00:05:25,391
Thanks, Lucy, for a lovely evening.

121
00:05:25,391 --> 00:05:26,692
Good-bye.

122
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:39,705
85 cents.

123
00:05:45,778 --> 00:05:48,814
Straighten it up in the morning,
honey.

124
00:05:48,814 --> 00:05:50,983
Okay, dear.

125
00:05:50,983 --> 00:05:52,718
Anything you say.

126
00:06:14,407 --> 00:06:16,142
Hi.

127
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:19,612
Hello.

128
00:06:19,612 --> 00:06:22,648
You know, I was watching you tonight.

129
00:06:22,648 --> 00:06:23,949
You're cute.

130
00:06:23,949 --> 00:06:25,685
Thank you.

131
00:06:25,685 --> 00:06:28,721
You sure look handsome in that
smoking jacket.

132
00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:30,022
I do?

133
00:06:30,022 --> 00:06:31,757
Yeah... I love you.

134
00:06:33,492 --> 00:06:36,529
Lucy, what do you want?

135
00:06:36,529 --> 00:06:40,433
Nothing, I just love you, that's all.

136
00:06:40,433 --> 00:06:42,168
Well, that's nice.

137
00:06:42,168 --> 00:06:44,336
Do you love me?

138
00:06:44,336 --> 00:06:46,072
Sure, I love you.

139
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:49,108
Would you climb the highest mountain
for me?

140
00:06:49,108 --> 00:06:50,409
Uh-huh.

141
00:06:50,843 --> 00:06:53,879
Would you swim the widest ocean?

142
00:06:53,879 --> 00:06:56,048
Yeah.

143
00:06:56,048 --> 00:06:58,651
Would you do anything in the world
for me?

144
00:06:58,651 --> 00:06:59,952
Yup--

145
00:06:59,952 --> 00:07:02,988
anything but sing at Ethel's club
next week.

146
00:07:11,664 --> 00:07:15,134
I don't know what you're talking
about.

147
00:07:16,435 --> 00:07:19,472
And who told you?

148
00:07:19,472 --> 00:07:20,773
Fred told me.

149
00:07:20,773 --> 00:07:23,375
Oh, that big blabbermouth.

150
00:07:23,375 --> 00:07:25,111
All right, if that's the way you feel
about it,

151
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:27,279
I'll just tell Ethel we can't make
it.

152
00:07:27,279 --> 00:07:29,014
What did you say?

153
00:07:29,014 --> 00:07:32,051
I said, I'll just tell Ethel that we
can't make it.

154
00:07:32,051 --> 00:07:34,653
What do you mean "we"?

155
00:07:34,653 --> 00:07:35,955
Well, for your information,

156
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:38,991
Ethel asked me to appear at that
benefit, too.

157
00:07:38,991 --> 00:07:40,726
I thought perhaps we could sing a
duet together.

158
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,895
Oh, no.

159
00:07:43,763 --> 00:07:46,365
Oh, Ricky, wouldn't you do it for me?

160
00:07:46,365 --> 00:07:47,666
No.

161
00:07:47,666 --> 00:07:48,534
But I can't...

162
00:07:48,534 --> 00:07:49,401
No.

163
00:07:50,703 --> 00:07:52,438
No!

164
00:07:52,438 --> 00:07:54,607
Lucy, I am not going to appear

165
00:07:54,607 --> 00:07:55,908
at that benefit.

166
00:07:55,908 --> 00:07:57,209
Do you understand?

167
00:07:57,209 --> 00:08:01,113
And I don't want to hear another word
about it, right?

168
00:08:01,113 --> 00:08:02,414
That's better.

169
00:08:03,282 --> 00:08:07,186
(wailing)

170
00:08:07,186 --> 00:08:08,487
(wailing)

171
00:08:08,487 --> 00:08:10,656
Ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay.

172
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:11,957
(wailing)

173
00:08:11,957 --> 00:08:13,692
Now, Lucy!

174
00:08:15,427 --> 00:08:16,295
Lucy!

175
00:08:16,295 --> 00:08:18,898
(wailing)

176
00:08:18,898 --> 00:08:21,500
Lucy...

177
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,669
All right, honey, all right.

178
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:25,838
All right, I'll do it with you.

179
00:08:25,838 --> 00:08:28,007
You will?

180
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:31,043
Yes, I will.

181
00:08:31,043 --> 00:08:32,344
I have an arrangement

182
00:08:32,344 --> 00:08:34,079
that you might be able to do.

183
00:08:34,079 --> 00:08:35,381
I'll bring it home tomorrow night

184
00:08:35,381 --> 00:08:36,682
and we can rehearse it.

185
00:08:36,682 --> 00:08:38,851
Oh, Ricky, you're wonderful!

186
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:40,586
Mmm!

187
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:46,225
LUCY (singing scales): Ahh.

188
00:08:46,225 --> 00:08:47,960
Ahh.

189
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,261
Ahh.

190
00:08:49,261 --> 00:08:50,996
Ahh.

191
00:08:50,996 --> 00:08:52,298
Ahh.

192
00:08:52,298 --> 00:08:54,033
(no sound)

193
00:08:58,804 --> 00:09:00,105
Ahh.

194
00:09:00,105 --> 00:09:01,407
Ahh.

195
00:09:01,407 --> 00:09:02,708
Ahh.

196
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:04,009
Ahh.

197
00:09:04,009 --> 00:09:05,311
Ahh.

198
00:09:05,311 --> 00:09:07,046
Ahh.

199
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:07,913
Ahh.

200
00:09:07,913 --> 00:09:09,648
(no sound)

201
00:09:22,661 --> 00:09:23,963
Ahh.

202
00:09:23,963 --> 00:09:25,264
Ahh.

203
00:09:25,264 --> 00:09:26,565
Ahh.

204
00:09:26,565 --> 00:09:27,433
Ahh.

205
00:09:27,433 --> 00:09:28,734
Ahh.

206
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:30,035
Ahh.

207
00:09:30,035 --> 00:09:31,337
Ahh.

208
00:09:31,337 --> 00:09:33,072
(buzzer sounds)

209
00:09:46,518 --> 00:09:47,386
(buzzer sounds)

210
00:09:52,591 --> 00:09:55,194
(buzzer sounding)

211
00:09:56,061 --> 00:09:58,230
(knocking)

212
00:10:03,002 --> 00:10:05,170
Hi, honey, I forgot my key.

213
00:10:05,170 --> 00:10:06,472
Where's the song, where's the song?

214
00:10:06,472 --> 00:10:07,339
Is this it?

215
00:10:07,339 --> 00:10:08,641
That's the song.

216
00:10:08,641 --> 00:10:09,508
Ha-ha!

217
00:10:09,508 --> 00:10:13,412
"Auf Wiedersehen"?

218
00:10:13,412 --> 00:10:16,448
That's a nice Cuban melody.

219
00:10:16,448 --> 00:10:18,183
Well, I thought it would be very good
for you.

220
00:10:18,617 --> 00:10:19,051
Well, come on, let's try it.

221
00:10:19,485 --> 00:10:20,352
All right.

222
00:10:20,352 --> 00:10:21,220
Here, give me that.

223
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:22,955
This is your part,

224
00:10:22,955 --> 00:10:25,124
and this is mine.

225
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:26,859
All of this is mine?

226
00:10:26,859 --> 00:10:28,160
Yeah.

227
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:32,064
Oh, honey, that isn't fair to you.

228
00:10:32,064 --> 00:10:34,233
Well, sweetheart, you are the star.

229
00:10:34,233 --> 00:10:35,534
(giggles)

230
00:10:35,534 --> 00:10:37,269
So you sing all the words

231
00:10:37,269 --> 00:10:38,570
that are written on your music,

232
00:10:38,570 --> 00:10:40,739
and I'll sing everything on mine.

233
00:10:40,739 --> 00:10:41,607
Okay.
All right?

234
00:10:41,607 --> 00:10:42,908
(clears throat)

235
00:10:45,077 --> 00:10:45,945
Are you ready?

236
00:10:45,945 --> 00:10:47,680
Yep.

237
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,415
Okay, let's try it.

238
00:10:49,415 --> 00:10:51,583
(playing piano)

239
00:10:51,583 --> 00:10:58,090
Come, let us stroll down lovers' lane

240
00:10:58,524 --> 00:11:04,163
Once more to sing love's old refrain

241
00:11:04,596 --> 00:11:07,633
Soon we must say...

242
00:11:07,633 --> 00:11:08,934
Auf...

243
00:11:08,934 --> 00:11:12,404
Wiedersehen...

244
00:11:12,404 --> 00:11:13,706
Auf...

245
00:11:13,706 --> 00:11:19,778
Wiedersehen, my dear.

246
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:26,285
Here in your arms I can't remain

247
00:11:26,285 --> 00:11:31,924
So let me kiss you once again

248
00:11:32,791 --> 00:11:35,828
Soon we must say...

249
00:11:35,828 --> 00:11:37,129
Auf...

250
00:11:37,129 --> 00:11:40,599
Wiedersehen...

251
00:11:40,599 --> 00:11:42,334
Auf...

252
00:11:42,334 --> 00:11:48,407
Wiedersehen, my dear.

253
00:11:48,407 --> 00:11:54,480
Your love will cling to me

254
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:58,817
Through the lonely daytime

255
00:11:58,817 --> 00:12:05,758
Each night will bring to me

256
00:12:05,758 --> 00:12:13,565
The magic memory of Maytime.

257
00:12:13,565 --> 00:12:20,072
I know my heart won't beat again...

258
00:12:21,373 --> 00:12:27,012
Until the day we meet again

259
00:12:27,012 --> 00:12:31,350
Sweetheart, good-bye...

260
00:12:32,217 --> 00:12:33,519
Auf...

261
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:36,555
Wiedersehen...

262
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:39,158
Auf...

263
00:12:39,158 --> 00:12:46,965
Wiedersehen, my dear.

264
00:12:53,472 --> 00:12:54,773
What's the matter?

265
00:12:54,773 --> 00:12:56,508
Didn't you like the song?

266
00:12:56,508 --> 00:12:58,677
Auf!

267
00:13:04,316 --> 00:13:05,617
What's wrong with it?

268
00:13:05,617 --> 00:13:07,352
What's wrong with it?

269
00:13:07,352 --> 00:13:09,521
I sound like a hungry seal.

270
00:13:11,256 --> 00:13:12,558
Honey, don't be silly.

271
00:13:12,558 --> 00:13:13,859
The audience will love us.

272
00:13:13,859 --> 00:13:17,329
Well, they might love you, but
they're going throw me a fish.

273
00:13:17,329 --> 00:13:20,365
Ricky Ricardo, you bring me another
song.

274
00:13:20,365 --> 00:13:22,534
Well, I am very sorry, honey,

275
00:13:22,534 --> 00:13:24,703
but that is the only song that I have

276
00:13:24,703 --> 00:13:26,438
that will fit your voice.

277
00:13:26,438 --> 00:13:29,475
We'll just have to forget all about
the benefit.

278
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:32,511
Well, you look again, you'll be able
to find me one.

279
00:13:32,511 --> 00:13:33,378
No, I wan't.

280
00:13:33,378 --> 00:13:35,547
Not much you want.

281
00:13:36,849 --> 00:13:39,017
You find me another song tomorrow

282
00:13:39,017 --> 00:13:40,752
or just dun't come home.

283
00:13:43,355 --> 00:13:44,656
(barking:)
Auf!

284
00:13:44,656 --> 00:13:45,524
Auf!

285
00:13:45,524 --> 00:13:47,693
Auf!

286
00:14:00,706 --> 00:14:02,441
Hey, Lucy, look.

287
00:14:02,441 --> 00:14:04,176
Isn't this wonderful?

288
00:14:04,176 --> 00:14:05,911
Look at that.

289
00:14:05,911 --> 00:14:07,646
Pretty good, huh?

290
00:14:08,947 --> 00:14:10,682
Lucy? What's the matter?

291
00:14:14,153 --> 00:14:15,888
Lucy?

292
00:14:15,888 --> 00:14:18,490
Ricky did say he'd do it, didn't he?

293
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:19,791
Lucy?

294
00:14:19,791 --> 00:14:21,527
(banging on piano keys)

295
00:14:22,828 --> 00:14:25,864
This is the right name, isn't it?

296
00:14:25,864 --> 00:14:30,202
Well, yes, with one minor change:

297
00:14:34,973 --> 00:14:37,576
Mrs. Ricky Ricardo!

298
00:14:37,576 --> 00:14:39,745
Oh, no...

299
00:14:39,745 --> 00:14:41,480
and the show's tonight.

300
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:44,082
You were so sure you could wheedle
him.

301
00:14:44,082 --> 00:14:45,817
So you can't get Ricky.

302
00:14:45,817 --> 00:14:47,119
You still have me.

303
00:14:47,119 --> 00:14:49,288
After all, what's Ricky got that I
haven't got,

304
00:14:49,288 --> 00:14:51,456
except a band, a reputation...

305
00:14:51,456 --> 00:14:53,192
And talent.

306
00:14:54,493 --> 00:14:55,794
Well, now, let's not be unkind.

307
00:14:55,794 --> 00:14:57,529
Do you want me or don't you?

308
00:14:57,963 --> 00:14:58,830
Oh, I don't know.

309
00:14:59,264 --> 00:15:01,867
It's too late to have any new posters
printed

310
00:15:01,867 --> 00:15:04,036
and you are Mrs. Ricky Ricardo,

311
00:15:04,036 --> 00:15:06,205
but it's like expecting Clark Gable

312
00:15:06,205 --> 00:15:07,940
and getting Hubert Grimset.

313
00:15:10,976 --> 00:15:13,579
Hubert Grimset?
I never heard of him.

314
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:15,314
Exactly.

315
00:15:17,482 --> 00:15:20,519
Well, you must admit, I'm better than
nothing.

316
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:21,820
There you've got me.

317
00:15:23,555 --> 00:15:27,025
Just what were you intending to do in
this show tonight?

318
00:15:27,459 --> 00:15:30,495
Well, I'm not sure.

319
00:15:30,495 --> 00:15:31,363
I could sing.

320
00:15:31,797 --> 00:15:33,966
(gasping)

321
00:15:33,966 --> 00:15:38,737
But I'm not going to by popular
demand.

322
00:15:38,737 --> 00:15:41,340
I could dance, but I don't have a
partner.

323
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:43,075
Oh, dear.

324
00:15:43,075 --> 00:15:45,677
Oh...

325
00:15:45,677 --> 00:15:47,412
I know!

326
00:15:47,412 --> 00:15:50,015
Ricky's got a closet full of costumes
left from his shows.

327
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:50,882
I'll find one that fits me

328
00:15:51,316 --> 00:15:52,618
and I'll build a whole act around it.

329
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:53,919
Oh, let me help you.

330
00:15:53,919 --> 00:15:55,654
Haven't you ever seen this stuff in
here?

331
00:15:55,654 --> 00:15:56,955
No.

332
00:15:56,955 --> 00:15:57,823
BOTH: Ohh!

333
00:15:57,823 --> 00:15:58,690
(talking excitedly)

334
00:15:59,124 --> 00:16:00,425
ETHEL: What a treasure trove.

335
00:16:00,425 --> 00:16:03,028
There's more stuff in there than you
can shake a stick at.

336
00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:04,763
Hey, here's a clown suit.

337
00:16:04,763 --> 00:16:06,064
This might do.

338
00:16:06,064 --> 00:16:06,932
Let's see.

339
00:16:06,932 --> 00:16:08,667
You'll get a lot of laughs with that.

340
00:16:08,667 --> 00:16:10,836
I'll say I will.

341
00:16:11,703 --> 00:16:13,438
Oh, moths.

342
00:16:13,438 --> 00:16:15,173
Yeah.

343
00:16:15,607 --> 00:16:16,475
Hey, what's this?

344
00:16:16,908 --> 00:16:17,776
I don't know.

345
00:16:17,776 --> 00:16:18,644
(gasps)

346
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:21,246
Why it's half...
half a horse.

347
00:16:21,246 --> 00:16:22,981
Say, those moths were hungrier

348
00:16:23,415 --> 00:16:24,283
than I thought.

349
00:16:24,283 --> 00:16:26,451
Hey, look, here's the rest of it.

350
00:16:26,451 --> 00:16:28,186
Oh, Ethel!

351
00:16:28,186 --> 00:16:29,488
This is it, this is it!

352
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:30,789
We'll do a horse act.

353
00:16:30,789 --> 00:16:33,392
But it takes two people to do a horse
act.

354
00:16:33,392 --> 00:16:35,127
Well, what are you doing tonight?

355
00:16:35,127 --> 00:16:37,296
Me? I'm the chairman.

356
00:16:37,296 --> 00:16:39,464
So?

357
00:16:39,464 --> 00:16:40,766
I guess I could.

358
00:16:40,766 --> 00:16:42,501
Yeah, come on, let's try it on.

359
00:16:42,934 --> 00:16:44,236
Okay.

360
00:16:45,103 --> 00:16:46,838
Lucy!

361
00:16:52,477 --> 00:16:53,779
Ethel!

362
00:16:53,779 --> 00:16:54,646
Now!

363
00:16:54,646 --> 00:16:55,947
Ethel!
Oh...

364
00:16:55,947 --> 00:16:59,418
That's your half right there.

365
00:16:59,418 --> 00:17:01,153
No, sir, that's your half.

366
00:17:01,153 --> 00:17:02,888
Ethel, now let's be sensible about
this.

367
00:17:02,888 --> 00:17:04,623
Who's the big name in this twosome?

368
00:17:04,623 --> 00:17:06,358
I'm Mrs. Ricky Ricardo.

369
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:08,093
Listen, Lucy, when you're inside a
horse,

370
00:17:08,093 --> 00:17:10,696
it doesn't matter if you're Mrs.
Hubert Grimset.

371
00:17:12,431 --> 00:17:14,166
I'm only doing this benefit for you.

372
00:17:14,166 --> 00:17:16,768
I should think you could do this one
little thing for me.

373
00:17:16,768 --> 00:17:19,371
Listen, Lucy, even for sweet charity,

374
00:17:19,371 --> 00:17:21,973
I am not going to be the back end of
a horse.

375
00:17:24,576 --> 00:17:25,444
Ethel, now, be sensible.

376
00:17:25,444 --> 00:17:27,612
Who's going to recognize you?

377
00:17:27,612 --> 00:17:29,348
You just said so yourself.

378
00:17:29,348 --> 00:17:31,083
Well...

379
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:32,818
Come on, now try it on.

380
00:17:32,818 --> 00:17:34,119
(moaning)

381
00:17:34,119 --> 00:17:38,023
Why do these things always happen to
me?

382
00:17:38,457 --> 00:17:39,758
Take off your shoes.

383
00:17:39,758 --> 00:17:40,625
Take off my shoes?
Yes.

384
00:17:41,059 --> 00:17:43,228
You have to step into this thing.

385
00:17:43,228 --> 00:17:44,963
This is the front.
That's right.

386
00:17:44,963 --> 00:17:45,831
Into the feet?
Yeah.

387
00:17:46,264 --> 00:17:47,566
Now, I'll hold onto you.

388
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:51,036
Oh, if my family in Albuquerque could
see me,

389
00:17:51,036 --> 00:17:52,771
they'd die of shame.

390
00:17:54,506 --> 00:17:56,241
Speaking of Albuquerque--

391
00:17:56,241 --> 00:17:59,277
is it true that your father drinks
goat's milk?

392
00:17:59,277 --> 00:18:01,446
I only hope this fit the horse better

393
00:18:01,446 --> 00:18:02,748
than it does me.

394
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:04,049
Turn around now.

395
00:18:04,049 --> 00:18:06,651
That's it.

396
00:18:06,651 --> 00:18:07,519
There.

397
00:18:07,519 --> 00:18:10,122
There, that looks wonderful!

398
00:18:10,122 --> 00:18:14,025
Are you sure nobody can tell who I
am?

399
00:18:14,025 --> 00:18:18,363
I defy anybody to recognize you.

400
00:18:18,363 --> 00:18:19,664
Hi, Lucy.

401
00:18:19,664 --> 00:18:21,400
I got something for you.

402
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,701
Hello, Fred.

403
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:26,605
Hello, Ethel.

404
00:18:33,979 --> 00:18:35,714
What did I tell you?

405
00:18:35,714 --> 00:18:37,015
Oh, now, Ethel...

406
00:18:37,015 --> 00:18:40,051
Fred had to know that was you in that
costume,

407
00:18:40,051 --> 00:18:41,353
didn't you Fred?

408
00:18:41,353 --> 00:18:43,522
What costume?

409
00:18:43,522 --> 00:18:45,690
That's all, brother-- count me out.

410
00:18:45,690 --> 00:18:46,992
Oh, Ethel!

411
00:18:46,992 --> 00:18:48,293
Oh, no.

412
00:18:48,293 --> 00:18:49,594
Oh, Ethel!

413
00:18:49,594 --> 00:18:50,896
Nothing doing.

414
00:18:50,896 --> 00:18:52,631
Lucy, I stopped by the club, and
Ricky asked me

415
00:18:52,631 --> 00:18:53,498
to bring you this.
Music?

416
00:18:53,932 --> 00:18:55,667
It's the number he's going to do with
you tonight

417
00:18:55,667 --> 00:18:56,535
at Ethel's benefit.

418
00:18:56,535 --> 00:18:58,703
Oh, Ethel, he's going to do it!

419
00:18:58,703 --> 00:19:00,005
Thank goodness.

420
00:19:00,005 --> 00:19:00,872
He wants you to look it over,

421
00:19:00,872 --> 00:19:02,174
and he'll join you there later.

422
00:19:02,174 --> 00:19:03,909
He's bringing the costumes.
Oh, wonderful.

423
00:19:03,909 --> 00:19:05,644
"Underneath the Bamboo Tree."

424
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:08,680
Oh, Ethel, this is that cute song and
dance number

425
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:10,849
that Ricky had in the show last year.

426
00:19:10,849 --> 00:19:12,150
I know it backwards.

427
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:14,319
Da-da...
da-da, da-da

428
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:16,488
Da-da...
da-da, da-da...

429
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:17,789
What's all this?

430
00:19:17,789 --> 00:19:18,657
Oh, those are jokes--

431
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:20,392
Ricky's got a cane that he taps on
the floor with

432
00:19:20,392 --> 00:19:22,561
when he wants the music to stop...

433
00:19:22,561 --> 00:19:23,428
(tapping)

434
00:19:23,428 --> 00:19:25,163
And you tell one of these jokes.

435
00:19:25,163 --> 00:19:26,898
Oh, good, I love to tell jokes.

436
00:19:26,898 --> 00:19:28,633
Hey, rehearse them with me, will you,
Fred?

437
00:19:28,633 --> 00:19:29,501
Why, sure I will.

438
00:19:29,935 --> 00:19:32,103
Dya-dya...
dya-dya, dya-dya

439
00:19:32,103 --> 00:19:34,272
Dya-dya...
dya-dya, dya-dya

440
00:19:34,272 --> 00:19:36,441
Dya-dya...
dya-dya, dya-dya

441
00:19:36,441 --> 00:19:37,742
Tap, tap, tap.

442
00:19:37,742 --> 00:19:38,610
Tap, tap, tap.

443
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:39,478
Hi, Lucy.

444
00:19:39,478 --> 00:19:40,779
Hiya, Ricky.

445
00:19:40,779 --> 00:19:41,646
You know, a funny thing happened to
me

446
00:19:41,646 --> 00:19:42,948
on the way to the theater this
evening.

447
00:19:42,948 --> 00:19:43,815
What?

448
00:19:43,815 --> 00:19:45,116
Well, a tramp come up to me in the
street

449
00:19:45,116 --> 00:19:47,719
and told me that he hadn't had a bite
in weeks.

450
00:19:47,719 --> 00:19:48,587
What did you do?

451
00:19:48,587 --> 00:19:49,888
I bit him.

452
00:19:51,623 --> 00:19:52,924
Oh, brother.

453
00:19:55,527 --> 00:19:58,129
You keep out of this, Whirlaway.

454
00:20:02,467 --> 00:20:04,636
Come on, let's get to my jokes.

455
00:20:04,636 --> 00:20:06,805
Da-da...
da-da, da-da.

456
00:20:06,805 --> 00:20:07,672
Tap, tap, tap.

457
00:20:07,672 --> 00:20:08,974
Did you hear...

458
00:20:08,974 --> 00:20:10,275
No, no, no, I forgot to tell you--

459
00:20:10,275 --> 00:20:11,142
that's Ricky's line.

460
00:20:11,142 --> 00:20:13,311
Did you hear about the big fire

461
00:20:13,311 --> 00:20:14,613
down at the shoe factory?

462
00:20:14,613 --> 00:20:15,914
What happened?

463
00:20:15,914 --> 00:20:18,083
200 soles were lost.

464
00:20:18,083 --> 00:20:20,252
Ho, ho, ho-- what a boffola.

465
00:20:21,553 --> 00:20:24,155
He must be saving the good jokes for
me.

466
00:20:24,155 --> 00:20:25,457
Tap, tap, tap.

467
00:20:25,457 --> 00:20:26,758
You know, there are two things...

468
00:20:26,758 --> 00:20:28,059
Wo, wo, wo...

469
00:20:28,059 --> 00:20:29,361
That's Ricky's line, too.

470
00:20:29,361 --> 00:20:30,662
Oh, I was afraid of that.

471
00:20:30,662 --> 00:20:32,831
You know, there are two things that I
can't...

472
00:20:32,831 --> 00:20:33,698
Wait a minute.

473
00:20:33,698 --> 00:20:35,433
Who does he think he is?

474
00:20:35,433 --> 00:20:38,036
He's got all the funny lines for
himself.

475
00:20:38,036 --> 00:20:39,771
Well, I'm not going to do it with
him.

476
00:20:39,771 --> 00:20:40,639
Oh, now, Lucy.

477
00:20:40,639 --> 00:20:42,807
If you don't do it, Ricky won't.

478
00:20:42,807 --> 00:20:44,109
Well, I don't care.

479
00:20:44,109 --> 00:20:46,278
Oh, Lucy, I never thought I'd live

480
00:20:46,278 --> 00:20:47,579
to ask this question,

481
00:20:47,579 --> 00:20:49,314
but will you please sing

482
00:20:49,314 --> 00:20:50,615
at our benefit tonight?

483
00:20:50,615 --> 00:20:51,483
No.

484
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:52,784
Oh, please.

485
00:20:52,784 --> 00:20:53,652
No.

486
00:20:54,085 --> 00:20:54,953
I'll be in such a mess.

487
00:20:54,953 --> 00:20:56,254
I told all the women...

488
00:20:56,254 --> 00:20:58,423
Wait a minute, wait a minute, I got
an idea.

489
00:20:58,423 --> 00:20:59,291
Okay, I'll do it.

490
00:20:59,291 --> 00:21:00,592
Good.

491
00:21:00,592 --> 00:21:01,459
You two skedaddle.

492
00:21:01,893 --> 00:21:03,628
I have a little studying to do.

493
00:21:03,628 --> 00:21:04,930
Oh, come on, Fred.
Let's leave her while she's...

494
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:06,665
All right, all right.

495
00:21:09,701 --> 00:21:11,436
Tap, tap, tap.

496
00:21:11,436 --> 00:21:13,605
(miming)

497
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:29,654
Oh, thank you, Mrs. Thompson, thank
you.

498
00:21:29,654 --> 00:21:32,257
And now, club members and guests

499
00:21:32,257 --> 00:21:34,426
comes the piece de resistance--

500
00:21:34,426 --> 00:21:38,330
that means the best part of the
evening--

501
00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:45,270
Mr. And Mrs. Ricky Ricardo in "Songs
and Witty Sayings."

502
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:48,740
(band strikes up jaunty music)

503
00:22:00,018 --> 00:22:05,657
We'll build a bungalow big enough for
two

504
00:22:05,657 --> 00:22:07,392
Big enough for two

505
00:22:07,392 --> 00:22:08,259
My honey!

506
00:22:08,259 --> 00:22:09,995
Yes, me and you

507
00:22:09,995 --> 00:22:11,296
Ha, ha, ha, ha

508
00:22:11,296 --> 00:22:13,465
And when we're married

509
00:22:13,465 --> 00:22:16,067
Happy we'll be...

510
00:22:16,067 --> 00:22:19,104
Under the bamboo...

511
00:22:19,104 --> 00:22:21,706
Underneath the bamboo tree.

512
00:22:21,706 --> 00:22:23,441
(tapping)

513
00:22:23,441 --> 00:22:24,309
Say, Lucy?

514
00:22:24,309 --> 00:22:25,176
Yeah, Ricky.

515
00:22:25,176 --> 00:22:26,478
You know, a funny thing happened to
me

516
00:22:26,478 --> 00:22:27,779
on the way to the theater tonight.

517
00:22:27,779 --> 00:22:28,647
What?

518
00:22:28,647 --> 00:22:29,948
A tramp came up to me in the street

519
00:22:29,948 --> 00:22:32,117
and said he hadn't had a bite in
weeks.

520
00:22:32,117 --> 00:22:34,285
What'd you do, bite him?

521
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:48,166
If... you'd... be...

522
00:22:48,166 --> 00:22:53,371
M-i-n-e, mine, I'll be t-h-i-n-e,
thine

523
00:22:53,371 --> 00:22:59,010
And I'll l-o-v-e, love you all the
t-i-m-e, time.

524
00:22:59,010 --> 00:23:00,311
(tapping)

525
00:23:00,311 --> 00:23:01,179
Say, Lucy?

526
00:23:01,613 --> 00:23:02,914
Yeah, Ricky.

527
00:23:02,914 --> 00:23:04,649
Did you hear about the big fire

528
00:23:04,649 --> 00:23:05,950
down in the shoe factory?

529
00:23:05,950 --> 00:23:08,119
I'll bet some heel started it.

530
00:23:16,361 --> 00:23:18,963
You're supposed to say, "what
happened?"

531
00:23:18,963 --> 00:23:19,831
Huh?

532
00:23:19,831 --> 00:23:20,699
"What happened?"

533
00:23:20,699 --> 00:23:23,301
200 soles were lost!

534
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:31,543
You...
are... the...

535
00:23:31,543 --> 00:23:36,748
B-e-s-t, best of all r-e-s-t, rest

536
00:23:36,748 --> 00:23:39,350
And I'll l-o-v-e, love you

537
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:42,387
All the t-i-m-e, time.

538
00:23:42,387 --> 00:23:43,254
(tapping)

539
00:23:43,254 --> 00:23:44,556
Go ahead.

540
00:23:48,026 --> 00:23:51,062
I'm onto your tricks.

541
00:23:51,062 --> 00:23:52,363
You start it this time.
Go ahead.

542
00:23:52,363 --> 00:23:53,665
Okay.

543
00:23:53,665 --> 00:23:54,966
You know, there are two things

544
00:23:54,966 --> 00:23:57,135
that I can't eat for breakfast--

545
00:23:57,135 --> 00:23:58,436
lunch and dinner.

546
00:24:05,810 --> 00:24:08,847
We'll...
have... an...

547
00:24:08,847 --> 00:24:13,184
L-a-r-k, lark up in the p-a-r-k, park

548
00:24:13,184 --> 00:24:18,389
And I'll k-i-s-s, kiss you in the
d-a-r-k, dark.

549
00:24:18,823 --> 00:24:19,691
(tapping)

550
00:24:19,691 --> 00:24:21,426
Go ahead.

551
00:24:23,161 --> 00:24:24,462
I got you this time.

552
00:24:24,462 --> 00:24:26,631
I got a joke that you never heard in
your whole life.

553
00:24:26,631 --> 00:24:28,800
Okay, go ahead, spill it, brother.

554
00:24:30,535 --> 00:24:34,005
Did you hear about the girl that was
so dumb

555
00:24:34,005 --> 00:24:37,475
that she thought a football coach had
four wheels?

556
00:24:37,475 --> 00:24:38,343
Ha, ha, ha--

557
00:24:38,343 --> 00:24:39,644
four wheels!

558
00:24:39,644 --> 00:24:40,945
(laughing)

559
00:24:40,945 --> 00:24:41,813
(laughing)

560
00:24:43,114 --> 00:24:45,717
How many wheels does it have?

561
00:24:52,223 --> 00:24:56,127
Oh, what's the use.

562
00:24:56,127 --> 00:25:02,634
And when we're married, happy we'll
be

563
00:25:02,634 --> 00:25:06,104
Under the bamboo...

564
00:25:06,104 --> 00:25:08,706
Under the bamboo...

565
00:25:08,706 --> 00:25:14,345
Under the bamboo tree.

00:00:35,201 --> 00:00:36,069
Oh...

2
00:00:39,105 --> 00:00:41,274
Oh, brother, am I beat.

3
00:00:41,707 --> 00:00:43,443
Well, what a sale, huh?

4
00:00:43,443 --> 00:00:45,611
Oh, these little piggies

5
00:00:45,611 --> 00:00:48,214
may never go to market again.

6
00:00:48,214 --> 00:00:50,383
Wouldn't you know I wouldn't be able
to find anything

7
00:00:50,383 --> 00:00:51,684
and you got the cutest dress in town.

8
00:00:51,684 --> 00:00:53,419
Truthfully, Ethel, isn't this

9
00:00:53,419 --> 00:00:56,022
the biggest bargain you've ever seen?

10
00:00:56,022 --> 00:00:57,323
Absolutely.

11
00:00:57,323 --> 00:00:59,058
Oh... course, now it's a question

12
00:00:59,058 --> 00:01:00,793
of how to get Ricky to let me keep
it.

13
00:01:00,793 --> 00:01:02,095
Oh, he'll have to let you keep it.

14
00:01:02,095 --> 00:01:03,830
You got it at a sale; they won't take
it back.

15
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:05,565
Yeah, well, that's the gamble I'm
taking.

16
00:01:05,565 --> 00:01:07,300
I have to get Ricky to say that I can
keep it

17
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:09,902
without letting him know that even if
he says I can't keep it,

18
00:01:09,902 --> 00:01:11,637
I'll have to keep it because the
store

19
00:01:11,637 --> 00:01:12,939
will make me keep it anyway.

20
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,409
Well, that ought to confuse him
enough.

21
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:19,445
Oh, I guess I'll be able to smooch
him into it.

22
00:01:19,445 --> 00:01:20,746
Sure.

23
00:01:20,746 --> 00:01:22,482
Well, I'll just get this out of his
sight

24
00:01:22,482 --> 00:01:23,783
until I get him good and mellow

25
00:01:23,783 --> 00:01:26,385
and then I'll spring it on him.

26
00:01:26,385 --> 00:01:28,988
Well, I guess I'll go down and smooch
Fred

27
00:01:28,988 --> 00:01:32,458
and see if I can talk him into
letting me keep this.

28
00:01:37,663 --> 00:01:38,965
So long, Lucy.

29
00:01:38,965 --> 00:01:40,700
Good-bye, dear.

30
00:01:51,544 --> 00:01:52,845
Is that you, Ricky?

31
00:01:52,845 --> 00:01:54,147
Yeah, honey.

32
00:01:54,147 --> 00:01:55,448
Hello, baby!

33
00:01:55,448 --> 00:01:56,749
Hi.

34
00:01:56,749 --> 00:01:57,617
Ho-ho.

35
00:01:57,617 --> 00:01:58,918
Your cheeks are cold.

36
00:01:58,918 --> 00:02:01,087
Oh, let me take off your coat, honey.

37
00:02:01,087 --> 00:02:02,388
Are your feet wet?

38
00:02:02,822 --> 00:02:04,123
No.

39
00:02:04,123 --> 00:02:06,726
Well, sit down, darling, you must be
awfully tired.

40
00:02:06,726 --> 00:02:08,461
Put the tootsies up.
That's a boy.

41
00:02:08,461 --> 00:02:09,762
There you are.

42
00:02:09,762 --> 00:02:13,666
Oh, you great, big, handsome husband,
you.

43
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:16,702
Mmm...

44
00:02:16,702 --> 00:02:17,570
Lucy.

45
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:18,871
Yes, dear.

46
00:02:18,871 --> 00:02:20,173
What have you done?

47
00:02:21,474 --> 00:02:23,643
Nothing, I'm just glad that I have

48
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:26,245
the cutest, sweetest, most wonderful
husband

49
00:02:26,245 --> 00:02:27,980
in the whole wide world.

50
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:29,282
Kiss me.

51
00:02:31,884 --> 00:02:33,619
You have something to tell me.

52
00:02:33,619 --> 00:02:34,487
What is it?

53
00:02:34,487 --> 00:02:37,523
Well, I don't think you're ready for
it yet.

54
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:47,934
I know!

55
00:02:47,934 --> 00:02:49,235
You bought something!

56
00:02:50,102 --> 00:02:52,271
Boy, am I losing my touch.

57
00:02:52,271 --> 00:02:54,440
How much is it going to cost me?

58
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:56,609
How much is it going to cost me?

59
00:02:56,609 --> 00:02:58,778
Now, Ricky, don't get mad till I show
it to you.

60
00:02:58,778 --> 00:03:00,947
You've got to agree it's a bargain.

61
00:03:02,248 --> 00:03:04,850
Isn't it the cutest thing you've ever
seen?

62
00:03:04,850 --> 00:03:06,152
How much?

63
00:03:06,152 --> 00:03:08,754
Notice the full skirt and the
sensational neckline?

64
00:03:08,754 --> 00:03:09,622
How much?

65
00:03:09,622 --> 00:03:10,923
Isn't it a divine color, Ricky?

66
00:03:10,923 --> 00:03:12,225
How much?

67
00:03:12,225 --> 00:03:13,526
Of course, I'll have to shorten it a
little.

68
00:03:13,526 --> 00:03:15,261
How much?!

69
00:03:15,261 --> 00:03:17,430
About 2? inches.

70
00:03:19,165 --> 00:03:20,900
I'll have that done tomorrow.

71
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:23,936
Let me see that, let me see that.

72
00:03:23,936 --> 00:03:25,238
?Este vestidito?

73
00:03:25,238 --> 00:03:26,973
?Esta cochita tan flaquita?

74
00:03:26,973 --> 00:03:28,708
?Este pedacito de tela?

75
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:30,876
$59.95!

76
00:03:30,876 --> 00:03:33,913
Y despues de todo eso hay que pagar
tambien,

77
00:03:33,913 --> 00:03:35,214
plus sales tax!

78
00:03:36,515 --> 00:03:39,118
Well, that means you like it, doesn't
it?

79
00:03:39,118 --> 00:03:40,853
Now, Lucy, you don't need that dress.

80
00:03:40,853 --> 00:03:41,721
You got plenty of clothes.

81
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:42,588
No, I haven't.

82
00:03:42,588 --> 00:03:44,323
I looked in my closet this morning

83
00:03:44,323 --> 00:03:46,058
and you know what?

84
00:03:46,058 --> 00:03:48,661
I haven't a thing to wear.
I haven't a thing to wear.

85
00:03:48,661 --> 00:03:49,528
Well, I haven't.

86
00:03:49,528 --> 00:03:51,264
Honey, you got a closet full of
clothes.

87
00:03:51,264 --> 00:03:53,432
Well, all my friends have seen me in
them.

88
00:03:53,432 --> 00:03:56,035
Well, then get yourself a new set of
friends.

89
00:03:56,902 --> 00:03:58,204
Very funny.

90
00:03:58,204 --> 00:04:00,373
Look, honey, I'm not going to pay for
that dress.

91
00:04:00,806 --> 00:04:01,674
Then I will!

92
00:04:01,674 --> 00:04:02,975
All right, you pay for it.

93
00:04:02,975 --> 00:04:04,710
I'm not going to stand here and
argue.

94
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:06,879
I got to get dressed to go to the
show.

95
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:08,180
She's going to pay for it.

96
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:09,482
(chuckles)

97
00:04:09,482 --> 00:04:10,349
Well, I will!

98
00:04:10,349 --> 00:04:12,518
I'll show you, I'll get a job!

99
00:04:12,518 --> 00:04:13,819
Job?

100
00:04:13,819 --> 00:04:14,687
You?

101
00:04:14,687 --> 00:04:15,988
Ha!

102
00:04:15,988 --> 00:04:18,157
I could make money if I wanted to.

103
00:04:18,157 --> 00:04:20,326
Where are you ever get a job?

104
00:04:20,326 --> 00:04:23,362
How about using me in your club as a
singer?

105
00:04:25,531 --> 00:04:26,832
As a dancer?

106
00:04:28,567 --> 00:04:29,869
Chorus girl?

107
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:32,905
Parking cars?

108
00:04:35,074 --> 00:04:36,809
Oh...

109
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:39,845
See you later, honey.

110
00:04:40,713 --> 00:04:42,448
Ricky!

111
00:04:42,448 --> 00:04:44,617
Where are you going?

112
00:04:45,484 --> 00:04:47,219
Going down to the club.

113
00:04:47,219 --> 00:04:49,388
Well, put some clothes on!

114
00:04:49,388 --> 00:04:53,726
Well, I'd love to, honey, but, uh, I
haven't a thing to wear.

115
00:04:53,726 --> 00:04:55,027
Oh...

116
00:05:05,004 --> 00:05:07,173
Good morning, Lucy.

117
00:05:10,209 --> 00:05:11,510
Lucy?

118
00:05:13,245 --> 00:05:14,980
Well, this is a switch.

119
00:05:18,017 --> 00:05:20,186
Lucy, I haven't got any breakfast.

120
00:05:20,186 --> 00:05:21,921
It's on the stove.
Get it yourself.

121
00:05:21,921 --> 00:05:23,222
Now, Lucy...

122
00:05:23,222 --> 00:05:25,391
Listen, I am no longer the doting
housewife.

123
00:05:25,391 --> 00:05:28,427
If you are going to send me out into
the world of business

124
00:05:28,427 --> 00:05:29,729
to earn my own money

125
00:05:29,729 --> 00:05:32,331
you can just treat me like a fellow
businessman.

126
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,669
All right, fellow businessman.

127
00:05:43,609 --> 00:05:45,344
Hey, pardon me,

128
00:05:45,344 --> 00:05:47,513
will you pass the sugar, mister?

129
00:05:51,417 --> 00:05:54,019
Any good jobs open, mac?

130
00:05:54,019 --> 00:05:55,321
Lots of them.

131
00:05:55,755 --> 00:05:57,490
I just have to take my choice.

132
00:05:57,490 --> 00:05:58,357
Stenographer.

133
00:05:58,791 --> 00:05:59,658
Nah.

134
00:05:59,658 --> 00:06:00,960
Bookkeeper.

135
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,261
Nah.

136
00:06:02,261 --> 00:06:03,129
Cook.
No!

137
00:06:05,297 --> 00:06:06,599
Lady wrestler.

138
00:06:06,599 --> 00:06:10,503
Hmm...

139
00:06:11,804 --> 00:06:13,973
Oh, this is terribly unfair.

140
00:06:13,973 --> 00:06:14,840
What is?

141
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:15,708
Well, apparently,

142
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:17,443
you can't get a job in this town

143
00:06:17,443 --> 00:06:18,744
unless you can do something.

144
00:06:20,913 --> 00:06:22,648
Yeah, how about that?

145
00:06:22,648 --> 00:06:24,383
Well, good-bye, fellow worker.

146
00:06:24,383 --> 00:06:25,684
Good-bye.

147
00:06:25,684 --> 00:06:27,853
Oh, listen, honey, I won't be home

148
00:06:27,853 --> 00:06:29,155
till late tonight.

149
00:06:29,155 --> 00:06:31,757
Jerry has me booked in some charity
affair or something.

150
00:06:31,757 --> 00:06:33,058
Okay.

151
00:06:33,058 --> 00:06:34,794
I'll see you later, bye.

152
00:06:34,794 --> 00:06:36,095
Bye.

153
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:39,131
Good morning, Lucy.

154
00:06:39,131 --> 00:06:40,866
Hi.

155
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:44,336
Well, how did you make out last
night?

156
00:06:44,336 --> 00:06:46,505
Did you get to keep the dress?

157
00:06:46,505 --> 00:06:47,807
I can keep it if I pay for it.

158
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:48,674
I'm going to get a job.

159
00:06:48,674 --> 00:06:51,710
Job? You? Ha!

160
00:06:53,446 --> 00:06:55,614
Well, you don't have to get nasty
about it.

161
00:06:55,614 --> 00:06:58,217
There's a lot of things in here that
I can do.

162
00:06:58,217 --> 00:06:59,518
What, for instance?

163
00:06:59,518 --> 00:07:01,687
Well, I could be a...

164
00:07:01,687 --> 00:07:02,988
um...

165
00:07:02,988 --> 00:07:05,157
Well, I could...

166
00:07:05,157 --> 00:07:06,892
I could be a baby-sitter.

167
00:07:06,892 --> 00:07:08,194
Yeah.

168
00:07:08,194 --> 00:07:09,495
50 cents an hour.

169
00:07:09,495 --> 00:07:10,796
Oh...

170
00:07:10,796 --> 00:07:12,531
Gee, it's disgusting the measly wages

171
00:07:12,531 --> 00:07:13,399
they pay baby-sitters.

172
00:07:13,399 --> 00:07:15,134
At that rate it would take you

173
00:07:15,134 --> 00:07:16,435
a year to pay for that dress.

174
00:07:16,435 --> 00:07:18,170
Look at that-- "Baby-sitter, 50 cents
an hour.

175
00:07:18,170 --> 00:07:20,339
"Baby-sitter, 50 cents an hour.

176
00:07:20,339 --> 00:07:22,074
"Baby-sitter, $50 an...

177
00:07:22,074 --> 00:07:24,243
Five dollars an hour!"

178
00:07:24,243 --> 00:07:25,978
Oh, that must be a misprint.

179
00:07:25,978 --> 00:07:27,713
No, it isn't, right there--

180
00:07:27,713 --> 00:07:29,882
"Baby-sitter, five dollars an hour."

181
00:07:29,882 --> 00:07:32,918
I'm going to call up and see if
that's right.

182
00:07:32,918 --> 00:07:34,220
Susquehanna seven...

183
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:35,955
Listen, Lucy, if they're willing to
pay

184
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:37,690
five dollars an hour for a
baby-sitter,

185
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:39,425
there's a catch in it someplace.

186
00:07:39,425 --> 00:07:41,594
I don't care.

187
00:07:41,594 --> 00:07:44,630
I wonder what kind of a baby it could
be?

188
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:46,365
Listen, for five dollars an hour

189
00:07:46,365 --> 00:07:48,100
I'll sit with a baby gorilla.

190
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:49,401
Hello?

191
00:07:49,401 --> 00:07:52,438
Hello, I'm calling about your ad in
the paper.

192
00:07:52,438 --> 00:07:54,607
Five dollars an hour for
baby-sitting,

193
00:07:54,607 --> 00:07:55,908
is that correct?

194
00:07:55,908 --> 00:07:59,378
Well, why do you pay so much?

195
00:07:59,378 --> 00:08:01,981
I mean, what kind of a baby is it?

196
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:04,583
A little boy.

197
00:08:04,583 --> 00:08:05,885
A little boy what?

198
00:08:08,487 --> 00:08:10,656
I mean, is it human?

199
00:08:11,957 --> 00:08:12,825
What is it?

200
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:14,560
It's all right, it's just a little
boy.

201
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,295
There's something fishy!

202
00:08:16,295 --> 00:08:19,765
Yes, yes, yes, you can bring him
around this afternoon.

203
00:08:19,765 --> 00:08:24,537
The name is Mrs. Ricardo, 623 east
68th street.

204
00:08:24,537 --> 00:08:25,838
About 2:00?

205
00:08:25,838 --> 00:08:27,139
Fine.

206
00:08:27,139 --> 00:08:28,440
All right, good-bye.

207
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:31,043
Just think, Ethel, if she leaves him
here

208
00:08:31,043 --> 00:08:33,212
four hours this afternoon, I'll make
$20.

209
00:08:33,646 --> 00:08:34,947
If you're still alive.

210
00:08:34,947 --> 00:08:36,682
Oh, don't be so pessimistic.

211
00:08:36,682 --> 00:08:37,983
It's just a little boy.

212
00:08:37,983 --> 00:08:39,285
Now, what do you think

213
00:08:39,285 --> 00:08:41,453
I better have ready for him when he
gets here?

214
00:08:41,453 --> 00:08:43,188
A little girl.

215
00:08:45,791 --> 00:08:48,394
(doorbell buzzes)

216
00:08:50,129 --> 00:08:50,996
Mrs. Ricardo?

217
00:08:50,996 --> 00:08:52,298
Mrs. Hudson?

218
00:08:52,298 --> 00:08:53,599
Yes.
Oh, come in, please.

219
00:08:53,599 --> 00:08:54,466
Thank you.

220
00:08:54,466 --> 00:08:55,768
This must be your little boy.

221
00:08:56,201 --> 00:08:57,503
Yes, this is our little Jimmy.

222
00:08:57,503 --> 00:09:00,105
Hello, Jimmy, want me to help you off
with your...

223
00:09:00,105 --> 00:09:02,708
I can take it off myself!

224
00:09:04,009 --> 00:09:06,178
Uh, what's the matter, Jimmy?

225
00:09:06,178 --> 00:09:07,479
Don't you like me?

226
00:09:07,479 --> 00:09:08,781
I like you.

227
00:09:08,781 --> 00:09:10,950
And we're going to have lots of fun
together today,

228
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:11,817
now, aren't we?

229
00:09:12,251 --> 00:09:13,118
Oh, brother!

230
00:09:14,853 --> 00:09:17,022
Well, I'll be running along now

231
00:09:17,022 --> 00:09:18,757
and leave Jimmy with you.

232
00:09:18,757 --> 00:09:20,492
I'm due at the hairdresser.

233
00:09:20,492 --> 00:09:23,095
We're going to be in a show this
evening.

234
00:09:23,095 --> 00:09:24,396
Oh, really?

235
00:09:24,396 --> 00:09:27,866
Well, it's just an amateur contest
that our club is giving.

236
00:09:27,866 --> 00:09:28,734
It's for charity...

237
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:30,035
I'm hungry!

238
00:09:30,035 --> 00:09:31,770
Oh, Jimmy, dear, your mother is
talking.

239
00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:33,505
I'm hungry!
I'm hungry!

240
00:09:33,505 --> 00:09:35,240
Ahh!! Oh...!

241
00:09:39,144 --> 00:09:41,313
Jimmy!

242
00:09:41,313 --> 00:09:43,916
Well, I'll leave you two alone

243
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:46,518
and I'll be back about 5:00.

244
00:09:46,518 --> 00:09:48,687
Well, I'm sure we'll be all right.

245
00:09:48,687 --> 00:09:50,856
Now, Jimmy, you behave.

246
00:09:50,856 --> 00:09:52,157
Yeah.

247
00:09:52,157 --> 00:09:55,628
Oh, all these lovely things.

248
00:09:55,628 --> 00:09:59,531
(clucking tongue)

249
00:09:59,531 --> 00:10:01,700
Well, good-bye.

250
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:03,869
Good-bye.

251
00:10:03,869 --> 00:10:04,737
Ooh.

252
00:10:04,737 --> 00:10:05,604
Hey...

253
00:10:05,604 --> 00:10:06,905
I said I was hungry!

254
00:10:06,905 --> 00:10:07,773
All right, all right.

255
00:10:07,773 --> 00:10:09,508
Yeah, cookies and milk in the
kitchen.

256
00:10:09,508 --> 00:10:10,809
Come on.

257
00:10:13,846 --> 00:10:15,147
Right over there.

258
00:10:21,654 --> 00:10:23,822
(no voice)

259
00:10:49,848 --> 00:10:52,017
Uh, more cookies, Jimmy?

260
00:10:52,017 --> 00:10:52,885
Yeah.

261
00:10:52,885 --> 00:10:54,186
Help yourself.

262
00:10:58,524 --> 00:11:00,693
Here, Elmer, eat that.

263
00:11:02,861 --> 00:11:04,596
What do you have in there?

264
00:11:04,596 --> 00:11:06,331
It's my pet frog, Elmer.

265
00:11:06,331 --> 00:11:07,199
Oh!

266
00:11:07,199 --> 00:11:08,500
Well, put that thing away.

267
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:10,669
How can you carry something like that
around with you?

268
00:11:10,669 --> 00:11:12,404
Aah, women!

269
00:11:14,573 --> 00:11:15,441
What's out here?

270
00:11:15,441 --> 00:11:16,742
Oh, that's the back porch.

271
00:11:16,742 --> 00:11:18,043
Now, don't go out; you'll fall of.

272
00:11:18,043 --> 00:11:19,344
Are you kidding?

273
00:11:19,344 --> 00:11:21,080
No, now, Jimmy, I mean it!

274
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,815
Now, come on, you go in the living
room and you wait for me.

275
00:11:22,815 --> 00:11:24,116
We'll be in...
I'll play games with you.

276
00:11:24,116 --> 00:11:25,417
Now, go ahead.

277
00:11:35,394 --> 00:11:36,695
Well, here I am.

278
00:11:36,695 --> 00:11:37,996
Game time.

279
00:11:37,996 --> 00:11:41,033
Well, I've been waiting for you.

280
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:43,202
What took you so long?

281
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:46,238
Uh, what game would you like to play?

282
00:11:46,238 --> 00:11:47,539
Who wants to play games?

283
00:11:47,973 --> 00:11:48,841
I'm hungry.

284
00:11:48,841 --> 00:11:50,142
Hungry!

285
00:11:50,142 --> 00:11:51,877
How could you possibly be hungry?

286
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:53,612
I'm hungry! I'm hungry!

287
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,215
Ahh! Oh...!

288
00:12:00,119 --> 00:12:01,854
All right!

289
00:12:01,854 --> 00:12:03,155
I made a mistake!

290
00:12:03,155 --> 00:12:04,022
Okay!

291
00:12:04,022 --> 00:12:05,324
Out here!

292
00:12:07,926 --> 00:12:09,228
Over there.

293
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:10,529
Sit down.

294
00:12:17,903 --> 00:12:21,373
Oh, my, look at those dirty hands!

295
00:12:21,373 --> 00:12:23,108
Oh, you go wash your hands.

296
00:12:23,108 --> 00:12:24,409
I don't want to.

297
00:12:24,409 --> 00:12:25,711
You go into the living room,

298
00:12:25,711 --> 00:12:27,880
into the bathroom and wash your
hands!

299
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:28,747
Now, go on.

300
00:12:28,747 --> 00:12:30,048
Aw...

301
00:12:30,048 --> 00:12:30,916
Aww...

302
00:12:36,555 --> 00:12:38,724
I said go wash your hands!

303
00:12:38,724 --> 00:12:40,459
What for? They're clean!

304
00:12:40,459 --> 00:12:42,194
What kind of a nitwit do you think I
am?

305
00:12:42,628 --> 00:12:44,797
I don't know, what kind are you?

306
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:48,267
Well, they're clean.

307
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:50,002
I don't know how you did it so fast

308
00:12:50,002 --> 00:12:51,303
but come on.

309
00:12:52,171 --> 00:12:53,906
What's that for?

310
00:12:53,906 --> 00:12:55,641
You said you were hungry!

311
00:12:55,641 --> 00:12:58,243
You already gave me some of those
lousy cookies.

312
00:12:58,243 --> 00:13:00,846
Well, I know...

313
00:13:00,846 --> 00:13:04,316
Guess you're having a hard time
getting rid of them, aren't you?

314
00:13:04,316 --> 00:13:06,051
That does it, all right, into the
living room

315
00:13:06,051 --> 00:13:07,786
we'll play games, I'll be in.

316
00:13:09,087 --> 00:13:09,955
(huffs)

317
00:13:29,908 --> 00:13:31,643
Well?

318
00:13:33,812 --> 00:13:35,113
Well, what?

319
00:13:35,113 --> 00:13:38,150
Where's my cookies and milk?

320
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:40,319
You said you didn't want any.

321
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:42,921
You won't give me any cookies and
milk!

322
00:13:42,921 --> 00:13:44,656
I'm hungry, I'm hungry, I'm hungry!

323
00:13:44,656 --> 00:13:47,259
(yells)

324
00:13:47,259 --> 00:13:50,295
Do I get my cookies and milk?

325
00:13:50,295 --> 00:13:52,030
Are you sure this time?

326
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:53,332
Sure, I'm sure!

327
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:55,500
All right, sit down!

328
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:08,513
(doorbell buzzes)

329
00:14:18,056 --> 00:14:19,791
(screams)
(screams)

330
00:14:19,791 --> 00:14:22,394
(crying)

331
00:14:22,394 --> 00:14:24,563
What's the matter, what's the matter?

332
00:14:24,563 --> 00:14:26,298
You scared me.

333
00:14:28,901 --> 00:14:31,503
How did you get out there?

334
00:14:31,503 --> 00:14:33,238
I walked out.

335
00:14:33,238 --> 00:14:34,539
But you were...

336
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:13,145
(screams)
(screams)

337
00:15:13,145 --> 00:15:14,446
Quit scaring me!

338
00:15:14,446 --> 00:15:17,049
Now, listen, that's a very funny
trick, that disappearing,

339
00:15:17,049 --> 00:15:18,784
but don't you do it again, see.

340
00:15:22,254 --> 00:15:25,724
I thought you said we were going to
play games.

341
00:15:25,724 --> 00:15:27,459
All right. What kind of a game do you
want to play?

342
00:15:27,459 --> 00:15:29,628
How about cowboys and Indians?

343
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:33,532
What?

344
00:15:33,532 --> 00:15:34,833
Cowboys!

345
00:15:34,833 --> 00:15:37,002
And Indians!

346
00:15:37,002 --> 00:15:39,171
Why, what a dirty trick!

347
00:15:39,171 --> 00:15:42,207
Why didn't your mother tell me you
were twins?

348
00:15:42,207 --> 00:15:45,243
Because nobody will baby-sit with us
when she does.

349
00:15:45,243 --> 00:15:47,412
Yeah, one of us is bad enough,

350
00:15:47,412 --> 00:15:49,581
but two of us-- mur-der!

351
00:15:49,581 --> 00:15:51,316
You can say that again.

352
00:15:51,316 --> 00:15:53,919
Come on, let's play cowboys and
Indians.

353
00:15:53,919 --> 00:15:55,220
Well, now that I know I'm sane,

354
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:56,955
I guess can face anything.

355
00:15:56,955 --> 00:15:59,124
We'll be the Indians and you'll be
the cowboy,

356
00:15:59,124 --> 00:16:00,859
and we'll burn you at the stake.

357
00:16:00,859 --> 00:16:02,594
Burn me at the stake?

358
00:16:02,594 --> 00:16:03,895
Yeah.

359
00:16:03,895 --> 00:16:06,064
Oh, no, no, let's find another game.

360
00:16:09,534 --> 00:16:13,005
What about "here we go round the
maypole"?

361
00:16:13,005 --> 00:16:14,740
Well, that sounds tame enough.

362
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:16,908
I saw a rope we can use on the	back
porch.

363
00:16:16,908 --> 00:16:17,776
Be careful, now.
Don't fall off.

364
00:16:17,776 --> 00:16:19,077
Ah...

365
00:16:19,077 --> 00:16:20,379
Ah...

366
00:16:20,379 --> 00:16:22,981
Say, is all this red stuff real?

367
00:16:22,981 --> 00:16:24,716
Well, it should be!

368
00:16:24,716 --> 00:16:26,885
I paid enough for it.

369
00:16:26,885 --> 00:16:28,186
Here's the rope, Tim.

370
00:16:29,921 --> 00:16:31,656
All right, stand up.

371
00:16:32,090 --> 00:16:33,825
Boy, this is going to be fun.

372
00:16:33,825 --> 00:16:35,560
You hold the middle of the rope
'cause you're the maypole.

373
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:37,295
Okay.

374
00:16:37,295 --> 00:16:41,199
ALL: Here we go round the maypole,
the maypole, the maypole

375
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:45,103
Here we go round the maypole, na, na,
na, na, na, na

376
00:16:45,103 --> 00:16:48,573
Here we go round the maypole, the
maypole, the maypole

377
00:16:48,573 --> 00:16:52,044
Here we go round the maypole, na, na,
na, na, na.

378
00:16:58,984 --> 00:17:01,586
(whooping)

379
00:17:01,586 --> 00:17:03,755
We'll start a fire and burn her at
the stake!

380
00:17:03,755 --> 00:17:05,490
Yeah, these papers will burn swell.

381
00:17:05,490 --> 00:17:08,093
Fellas, you're kidding, I hope!

382
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,262
Fellas!

383
00:17:10,262 --> 00:17:12,431
Fellas!

384
00:17:12,431 --> 00:17:13,732
Help!

385
00:17:13,732 --> 00:17:15,467
Help!

386
00:17:15,467 --> 00:17:16,334
Help!

387
00:17:16,334 --> 00:17:18,503
You gag her, I'll get the stake.

388
00:17:18,503 --> 00:17:19,805
Help!

389
00:17:19,805 --> 00:17:21,106
Help!

390
00:17:21,106 --> 00:17:22,407
Help!

391
00:17:22,407 --> 00:17:28,480
(muffled screaming)

392
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:31,950
(whooping)

393
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:34,553
(muffled cry)

394
00:17:34,553 --> 00:17:35,854
(whooping)

395
00:17:35,854 --> 00:17:38,023
How, me get matches.

396
00:17:38,023 --> 00:17:39,324
(muffled yell)

397
00:17:39,324 --> 00:17:41,059
How, paleface get um hot seat.

398
00:17:41,493 --> 00:17:43,228
(muffled scream)

399
00:17:43,228 --> 00:17:44,529
(phone rings)

400
00:17:44,529 --> 00:17:46,698
(muffled shouting)

401
00:17:46,698 --> 00:17:48,867
Hello.

402
00:17:48,867 --> 00:17:51,903
Hello, hello, Jimmy?
Or is it Timmy?

403
00:17:51,903 --> 00:17:54,072
Let me speak to Mrs. Ricardo.

404
00:17:54,506 --> 00:17:56,241
She can't talk now.

405
00:17:56,241 --> 00:17:58,410
(muffled screams)

406
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:02,747
Timmy, is Mrs. Ricardo on fire?

407
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:07,085
Not yet.

408
00:18:07,085 --> 00:18:10,122
Well, it's a good thing for you she
isn't!

409
00:18:10,122 --> 00:18:14,025
You know your father said he would
spank you both

410
00:18:14,025 --> 00:18:17,496
if you burn just one more sitter at
the stake!

411
00:18:17,496 --> 00:18:19,664
Now, you let me talk to her!

412
00:18:19,664 --> 00:18:21,833
Oh, all right.

413
00:18:21,833 --> 00:18:24,870
Mom wants to talk to you.

414
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:26,171
Take the gag out.

415
00:18:33,979 --> 00:18:35,280
Hello.

416
00:18:36,148 --> 00:18:37,449
Hello!

417
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:42,220
Oh, well, you found out my little
joke.

418
00:18:42,654 --> 00:18:43,955
(Hudson laughing)

419
00:18:43,955 --> 00:18:45,257
(mocking her laughter)

420
00:18:45,257 --> 00:18:49,161
Oh, listen, now, I'm all tied up.

421
00:18:49,161 --> 00:18:51,763
Yeah, well, that makes two of us.

422
00:18:51,763 --> 00:18:53,498
Uh, I wonder, Mrs. Ricardo

423
00:18:53,498 --> 00:18:56,101
if you would take my place with the
boys

424
00:18:56,101 --> 00:18:58,270
at the amateur contest tonight.

425
00:18:58,270 --> 00:18:59,571
What?

426
00:18:59,571 --> 00:19:03,909
If you win, I'll let you keep the
prize money-- $100.

427
00:19:03,909 --> 00:19:05,210
$100?

428
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:06,511
Well...

429
00:19:06,511 --> 00:19:09,548
Oh, thank you, Mrs. Ricardo.

430
00:19:09,548 --> 00:19:10,849
I don't... I didn't...

431
00:19:10,849 --> 00:19:12,584
Hello? Hello?

432
00:19:13,885 --> 00:19:16,922
Okay, boys, meet the new partner in
your act.

433
00:19:16,922 --> 00:19:19,524
You're going to do the act instead of
Mom?

434
00:19:19,524 --> 00:19:21,693
Yeah, but I have a hunch I'd be
better off

435
00:19:21,693 --> 00:19:24,296
if I just let you burn me at the
stake.

436
00:19:25,597 --> 00:19:26,898
Untie me!

437
00:19:28,633 --> 00:19:30,802
(applause)

438
00:19:32,537 --> 00:19:33,838
Very, very fine.

439
00:19:33,838 --> 00:19:35,140
Wasn't that fine?

440
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:36,441
That was little, uh...

441
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:39,477
uh, Willie May, little Willie May,

442
00:19:39,477 --> 00:19:42,514
who played the guitar with her feet.

443
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:45,550
Well, I'll try playing the guitar
with my hands.

444
00:19:45,550 --> 00:19:48,153
She probably does better with her
feet.

445
00:19:48,153 --> 00:19:50,322
(laughter)

446
00:19:50,322 --> 00:19:52,490
Are you ready, girls?
Here we go.

447
00:19:52,490 --> 00:19:54,226
Oh, this is a song, a brand-new
ballad.

448
00:19:54,226 --> 00:19:55,527
It's called

449
00:19:55,527 --> 00:19:58,563
"I'm Breaking My Back, Putting Up a
Front For You."

450
00:19:58,563 --> 00:20:01,600
A one, a two...

451
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:07,672
(band plays Latin swing music)

452
00:20:07,672 --> 00:20:11,576
I bought a 12-room house, a mountain
lodge

453
00:20:11,576 --> 00:20:16,781
A lemon-yellow Cadillac in a blue
garage

454
00:20:16,781 --> 00:20:21,553
I'm a-breaking my back putting up a
front for you

455
00:20:23,288 --> 00:20:27,192
I bought an aeroplane, it's just for
kicks

456
00:20:27,192 --> 00:20:32,397
Holds twice as many passengers as a
DC-6

457
00:20:32,397 --> 00:20:37,602
I'm a-breaking my back putting up a
front for you

458
00:20:37,602 --> 00:20:42,374
Oh... say, my heart goes bang, babe

459
00:20:42,374 --> 00:20:46,278
When I look at you, sister, I'm gone

460
00:20:46,278 --> 00:20:49,314
Who... gives a hang, babe

461
00:20:49,314 --> 00:20:52,350
If my bank account is overdrawn?

462
00:20:52,350 --> 00:20:56,688
I'm getting pedicures and manicures

463
00:20:56,688 --> 00:21:01,459
Just ever since I took a look at that
pan of yours

464
00:21:01,459 --> 00:21:05,797
I'm breaking my back putting up a
front for you

465
00:21:06,231 --> 00:21:08,400
Yeah, let's hear it, boys, let's hear
it!

466
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:11,002
Yep, ah!

467
00:21:11,002 --> 00:21:14,472
(playing Latin swing)

468
00:21:14,472 --> 00:21:18,810
I own a private train, it's pure gold
leaf

469
00:21:18,810 --> 00:21:24,015
On Friday nights I hook it onto the
Super Chief

470
00:21:24,015 --> 00:21:28,787
Breaking my back putting up a front
for you.

471
00:21:28,787 --> 00:21:30,088
Yeah!

472
00:21:30,088 --> 00:21:34,426
I got a French valet, a camp-de-aide

473
00:21:34,426 --> 00:21:39,631
A very famous movie star is my
upstairs maid

474
00:21:39,631 --> 00:21:43,968
Breaking my back putting up a front
for you.

475
00:21:43,968 --> 00:21:45,704
Oh, you girl!

476
00:21:45,704 --> 00:21:49,607
Oh... say, my heart goes bang, babe

477
00:21:49,607 --> 00:21:52,644
When I look at you, sister, I choke

478
00:21:52,644 --> 00:21:56,548
Who gives a hang, babe?

479
00:21:56,548 --> 00:21:59,584
I'm a Cuban who's got to go broke

480
00:21:59,584 --> 00:22:03,488
I bought a diamond ring worth 20
grand

481
00:22:03,488 --> 00:22:08,259
But I would gladly trade it in for a
wedding band

482
00:22:08,693 --> 00:22:13,031
I'm a-breaking my back putting up a
front for you

483
00:22:13,031 --> 00:22:15,200
Oh, yes, you...!

484
00:22:15,633 --> 00:22:21,706
Oh, breaking my back putting up a
front for you.

485
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:23,441
Hey!

486
00:22:23,441 --> 00:22:25,610
(applause)

487
00:22:29,514 --> 00:22:32,117
Thank you, thank you.

488
00:22:32,117 --> 00:22:34,719
Thank you very much, ladies and
gentlemen.

489
00:22:35,153 --> 00:22:36,020
And now...

490
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:38,623
the last contestant of the evening

491
00:22:38,623 --> 00:22:39,924
is, uh...

492
00:22:39,924 --> 00:22:42,527
Mrs. Hudson and the twins.

493
00:22:42,527 --> 00:22:44,696
Uh, are you ready?

494
00:22:44,696 --> 00:22:46,431
Oh, this is your music?

495
00:22:46,431 --> 00:22:47,732
Okay.

496
00:22:47,732 --> 00:22:49,901
They are going to do...

497
00:22:50,335 --> 00:22:52,937
"Ragtime Cowboy Joe."

498
00:22:55,106 --> 00:22:58,143
Here you are, Mr. Rizzo, "Ragtime
Cowboy Joe."

499
00:22:58,143 --> 00:22:59,878
Mrs. Hudson and the twins.

500
00:22:59,878 --> 00:23:01,179
Go ahead.

501
00:23:01,179 --> 00:23:06,384
(playing "Ragtime Cowboy Joe")

502
00:23:13,324 --> 00:23:14,626
(spittoon rings)

503
00:23:15,493 --> 00:23:16,795
(spittoon rings)

504
00:23:18,329 --> 00:23:19,831
(spittoon explodes)

505
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:39,784
ALL: He always sings swinging music
to the cattle

506
00:23:40,218 --> 00:23:43,688
As he swings back and forward in the
saddle

507
00:23:43,688 --> 00:23:48,026
On a horse that you'd think you'd pay
to gait him

508
00:23:48,026 --> 00:23:52,797
And there's such a funny meter to the
roar of his repeater

509
00:23:52,797 --> 00:23:56,267
How they run when they hear that
gallant gun

510
00:23:56,267 --> 00:23:59,304
Because the western folks all know

511
00:23:59,304 --> 00:24:01,906
He's a highfalutin, rootin', tootin'

512
00:24:01,906 --> 00:24:03,641
Son of a gun from Arizona

513
00:24:03,641 --> 00:24:07,545
Ragtime cowboy, swing time cowboy

514
00:24:07,545 --> 00:24:09,714
Ragtime cowboy Joe!

515
00:24:09,714 --> 00:24:11,449
(cap guns shooting)

516
00:24:17,522 --> 00:24:18,823
Elmer, you bad frog!

517
00:24:18,823 --> 00:24:20,558
Get back in your box!

518
00:24:20,558 --> 00:24:21,426
Elmer!

519
00:24:21,426 --> 00:24:22,293
What?

520
00:24:22,293 --> 00:24:24,028
Whoa, whoa...

521
00:24:30,535 --> 00:24:32,270
Ricky: Conga, conga!

522
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:33,571
Conga, conga, conga...

523
00:24:33,571 --> 00:24:35,306
(band plays conga music)

524
00:24:50,054 --> 00:24:53,091
All right, all right!

525
00:24:53,091 --> 00:24:56,127
(applause)

526
00:24:56,127 --> 00:24:57,862
(cheering)

527
00:24:58,296 --> 00:25:06,104
(applause)

528
00:25:06,104 --> 00:25:07,839
Okay, I guess...

529
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:10,008
I guess there's no doubt about it.

530
00:25:10,008 --> 00:25:13,478
The winners of our $100 cash prize--

531
00:25:13,478 --> 00:25:15,213
Mrs. Hudson and the twins.

532
00:25:15,213 --> 00:25:17,382
Here you are Mrs. Hudson, $100.

533
00:25:17,382 --> 00:25:18,249
Thank you, Mr. Ricardo.

534
00:25:18,249 --> 00:25:19,117
You're welcome.

535
00:25:22,587 --> 00:25:24,322

................life to tell......................
1
00:00:27,661 --> 00:00:29,511
Sometimes I get asked,

2
00:00:29,597 --> 00:00:32,748
"What does it take to win?"

3
00:00:32,867 --> 00:00:35,184
And that is, will.

4
00:00:35,302 --> 00:00:39,004
You have to have
the will to kill

5
00:00:39,106 --> 00:00:42,941
because you cannot win
without killing the enemy.

6
00:00:44,211 --> 00:00:47,913
And the other side
of that coin

7
00:00:48,015 --> 00:00:51,850
is that you have
to have the will to die.

8
00:00:53,854 --> 00:00:56,188
If you're gonna go to war,
you've got to make sure

9
00:00:56,290 --> 00:01:00,526
that you have
those two types of will

10
00:01:00,628 --> 00:01:05,130
in the deepest part
of your soul.

11
00:01:08,536 --> 00:01:10,002
But if you believe
in what you're doing,

12
00:01:10,087 --> 00:01:11,904
and the will is there,

13
00:01:12,006 --> 00:01:14,006
then victory is
always possible.

14
00:01:14,108 --> 00:01:15,507
And in fact,

15
00:01:15,576 --> 00:01:19,244
if you have the true will
and the true belief,

16
00:01:19,346 --> 00:01:24,116
victory is imminent
and undeniable.

17
00:01:37,698 --> 00:01:39,865
Reporter:
Insurgents and Jihadists
have found a home

18
00:01:39,917 --> 00:01:42,050
in Iraq's sprawling
Anbar Province.

19
00:01:42,169 --> 00:01:44,603
and have turned it
into a hotbed of violence.

20
00:01:54,715 --> 00:01:57,416
My name is Leif Babin.
I was a lieutenant,

21
00:01:57,518 --> 00:02:00,085
a platoon commander
of Charlie Platoon

22
00:02:00,187 --> 00:02:03,288
that SEAL Team 3
Task Unit Bruiser.

23
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:05,374
Right away, we wanted
to take our performance
to the next level,

24
00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:07,593
and so we trained harder
than anybody.

25
00:02:07,695 --> 00:02:10,362
Every, every type
of operation you could
think of

26
00:02:10,464 --> 00:02:12,431
out in the deserts, you know,
shooting our weapons,

27
00:02:12,533 --> 00:02:14,733
patrolling on foot,
jumping out of planes,

28
00:02:14,802 --> 00:02:16,568
and we had
an awesome group of guys

29
00:02:16,637 --> 00:02:18,303
that, that were
just fired up,

30
00:02:18,372 --> 00:02:19,805
ready to go get after it.

31
00:02:19,907 --> 00:02:22,257
We just had a,
a solid level of trust

32
00:02:22,343 --> 00:02:24,576
across the board, up and down
the chain of command.

33
00:02:24,645 --> 00:02:27,679
It's not about actually
doing the skills

34
00:02:27,781 --> 00:02:30,883
and all the, the tactics
perfectly.

35
00:02:30,968 --> 00:02:33,785
It's about knowing
each other,

36
00:02:33,888 --> 00:02:36,371
and that's where,
where everything really gels.

37
00:02:36,457 --> 00:02:41,059
When you're
with these guys 24/7,

38
00:02:41,162 --> 00:02:42,828
for months at a time,

39
00:02:42,897 --> 00:02:45,197
it's, it is family,
it's the same thing.

40
00:02:45,232 --> 00:02:48,233
It's a group of friends
that hang out together,

41
00:02:48,335 --> 00:02:50,669
live together,
work together,

42
00:02:50,754 --> 00:02:53,522
work out together,
go out together,

43
00:02:53,607 --> 00:02:54,907
and do everything
together.

44
00:02:54,975 --> 00:02:57,075
That's, that's
what a SEAL platoon is.

45
00:03:04,685 --> 00:03:06,251
Leif Babin:
Marc Lee joined
our platoon

46
00:03:06,353 --> 00:03:08,820
after we'd been working
together for about six months.

47
00:03:08,889 --> 00:03:12,207
Right away you could tell
he a presence about him.

48
00:03:12,326 --> 00:03:14,226
You knew he was a
smart guy, a hard worker,

49
00:03:14,311 --> 00:03:16,461
a very strong Christian guy.
His faith was very important
to him.

50
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:20,682
He came in,
and he's just a big dude,
quiet, humble

51
00:03:20,768 --> 00:03:22,467
and pretty fun loving,
you know,

52
00:03:22,519 --> 00:03:24,586
liked to have
a good time.

53
00:03:24,705 --> 00:03:26,555
Me and Marc,
we were in the same
boat crew

54
00:03:26,674 --> 00:03:28,040
going through BUD/S
and Hell Week

55
00:03:28,142 --> 00:03:29,157
and all of that stuff.

56
00:03:29,243 --> 00:03:30,809
You really get
to know people

57
00:03:30,878 --> 00:03:33,745
when people are mad
and tired and hungry.

58
00:03:33,814 --> 00:03:35,013
He would always
be making jokes.

59
00:03:35,115 --> 00:03:37,466
Didn't matter how much
we were hurting.

60
00:03:37,551 --> 00:03:40,285
He was just
absolutely hilarious.

61
00:03:40,387 --> 00:03:42,721
He liked to push
the envelope on stuff.

62
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:44,823
Marc showed up
to Charlie platoon,

63
00:03:44,892 --> 00:03:48,026
he very boldly stated
that, uh, "I've never been
choked out before."

64
00:03:48,128 --> 00:03:51,730
And so Chris Kyle
and a couple of other guys

65
00:03:51,799 --> 00:03:55,500
immediately helped him out
to make sure that that,
that was not the case.

66
00:03:55,603 --> 00:03:57,970
Marc immediately
was one of us

67
00:03:58,038 --> 00:04:00,606
and a big part
of our platoon.

68
00:04:00,674 --> 00:04:03,642
We did a trip, where we were
up and around Las Vegas.

69
00:04:03,744 --> 00:04:07,863
And when he would gamble,
he would get everyone
all riled up.

70
00:04:07,948 --> 00:04:10,432
He would
always be the loud one
at the table.

71
00:04:10,517 --> 00:04:12,017
Jocko Willink:
You know, when you're
playing Blackjack,

72
00:04:12,102 --> 00:04:14,386
the dealer busts,
and everybody else wins.

73
00:04:14,471 --> 00:04:17,773
If the dealer busted,
Marc would just throw up
his arms

74
00:04:17,858 --> 00:04:19,625
and, "Everybody is
a winner! "

75
00:04:19,693 --> 00:04:21,276
Everybody is a winner!

76
00:04:21,395 --> 00:04:22,544
Everybody's a winner

77
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:24,129
when, you know,
when the dealer busts.

78
00:04:24,231 --> 00:04:26,131
Then they bring in
another dealer because like,

79
00:04:26,233 --> 00:04:28,000
oh, we're winning, we gotta
bring another dealer in.

80
00:04:28,102 --> 00:04:30,252
And he was like,
"Oh, they're bringing
the iceman in."

81
00:04:30,337 --> 00:04:33,055
He would start clapping
and cheering, and he would get
everyone all riled up,

82
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:34,506
and people would start
betting more money,

83
00:04:34,575 --> 00:04:36,375
and it was just create,
create a lot of fun.

84
00:04:36,477 --> 00:04:38,844
And, that's,
you know, that's kind
of what Marc was like.

85
00:04:42,416 --> 00:04:44,149
Debbie Lee: I remember
so much Marc trying

86
00:04:44,218 --> 00:04:45,934
to explain to me
the brotherhood.

87
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:48,920
Like "Yeah, yeah, I get it,
you're close to these guys.

88
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:53,191
But as close
as your brother you grew up
with for 28 years?"

89
00:04:53,294 --> 00:04:56,194
"Yeah, mom,
I'm that close."

90
00:04:56,297 --> 00:05:00,232
Maya Elbaum:
You know, Marc had
a thing about him.

91
00:05:00,301 --> 00:05:02,150
Everybody loved Marc.

92
00:05:02,269 --> 00:05:05,937
He was completely
compassionate

93
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:08,040
to everybody.

94
00:05:08,108 --> 00:05:11,109
Debbie Lee:
He was that personality
that was bigger than life,

95
00:05:11,211 --> 00:05:13,745
not that, you know,
we didn't go through our share
of trials and tragedies,

96
00:05:13,847 --> 00:05:18,483
but he could just
take a situation in life
and make it funny.

97
00:05:18,585 --> 00:05:22,654
Two years in a row
his friends voted him
Class Clown.

98
00:05:22,756 --> 00:05:25,590
He always brought
joy and humor

99
00:05:25,659 --> 00:05:27,726
into the people
that he knew.

100
00:05:27,828 --> 00:05:29,695
Maya Elbaum:
He had a lot of layers.

101
00:05:29,763 --> 00:05:33,065
He was funny and silly.
He was very serious at times,

102
00:05:33,167 --> 00:05:36,401
athletic, like he,
he looked like a Greek god.

103
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:40,272
He loved soccer.
He actually played
professionally

104
00:05:40,374 --> 00:05:42,090
before he blew out
his knee.

105
00:05:42,176 --> 00:05:44,142
And then he went to school
to become a pastor.

106
00:05:44,211 --> 00:05:46,445
So, he was
a very religious man.

107
00:05:46,547 --> 00:05:50,766
And then he realized,
"no, I want to become
a Navy SEAL."

108
00:05:50,884 --> 00:05:53,685
We were completely in love.
We knew we wanted to spend

109
00:05:53,721 --> 00:05:57,422
the rest of our lives
with one another.

110
00:05:57,524 --> 00:06:00,709
I remember when he told me

111
00:06:00,794 --> 00:06:02,294
that he was going
to Ramadi, Iraq.

112
00:06:02,363 --> 00:06:05,964
It was just
this feeling of,
of sadness.

113
00:06:06,066 --> 00:06:08,233
It's a six-month
deployment,

114
00:06:08,335 --> 00:06:09,801
and the truth
of the matter is,

115
00:06:09,903 --> 00:06:11,770
is that they're gonna
be in harm's way.

116
00:06:11,839 --> 00:06:14,639
But he believed so much
in what he was doing.

117
00:06:14,742 --> 00:06:18,610
And as much
as Marc felt invincible,

118
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,613
there is always this back,

119
00:06:21,715 --> 00:06:23,231
back, you know, burning,

120
00:06:23,317 --> 00:06:27,085
burning feeling of,
of like as, you know,

121
00:06:27,171 --> 00:06:29,988
is this gonna
be the last?

122
00:06:44,538 --> 00:06:46,872
From Iraq tonight,
we have an exclusive look

123
00:06:46,957 --> 00:06:49,391
at what has become
the single most dangerous city

124
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:51,576
in that country
for US forces.

125
00:06:51,645 --> 00:06:53,361
An hour west
of Baghdad,

126
00:06:53,447 --> 00:06:55,981
terrorists hold the city
of Ramadi in a deadly grip,

127
00:06:56,066 --> 00:06:58,483
fueling the insurgency
and taking a terrible toll

128
00:06:58,552 --> 00:07:00,519
on the several thousand
American troops

129
00:07:00,621 --> 00:07:02,320
who are trying
to hold them at bay.

130
00:07:02,423 --> 00:07:06,958
In 2006, Ramadi
was the worst part of Iraq.

131
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:09,027
It's the capital
of Al Anbar Province,

132
00:07:09,079 --> 00:07:10,362
the biggest state
in Iraq.

133
00:07:10,414 --> 00:07:13,248
It was a total war zone.

134
00:07:13,333 --> 00:07:15,567
Leif Babin:
We were facing,
in what I would deem,

135
00:07:15,602 --> 00:07:19,104
as evil an enemy
as the US has, has ever faced.

136
00:07:19,156 --> 00:07:23,608
Back then, the enemy
was identified as AQI,
Al-Qaeda, Iraq.

137
00:07:23,694 --> 00:07:25,193
Leif Babin:
You're talking about,
you know,

138
00:07:25,312 --> 00:07:27,979
some of the same people
who are now ISIS.

139
00:07:28,081 --> 00:07:29,080
When you see
the kind of things

140
00:07:29,133 --> 00:07:30,449
that they do
to people and,

141
00:07:30,517 --> 00:07:32,884
and just the torture
and rape and murder,

142
00:07:32,970 --> 00:07:36,221
talking people into becoming
suicide bombers.

143
00:07:36,323 --> 00:07:37,906
Anyone that stood
against them,

144
00:07:37,991 --> 00:07:39,157
I mean, they're gonna
cut their head off

145
00:07:39,243 --> 00:07:40,692
and make an example
out of them,

146
00:07:40,794 --> 00:07:43,127
and, and they're absolutely
brutal and ruthless.

147
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:45,063
And Ramadi was kinda
the epicenter

148
00:07:45,165 --> 00:07:47,766
of their insurgency.

149
00:07:47,851 --> 00:07:49,985
The Marine Corps
and Army units that
were there,

150
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:53,839
they were doing
their utmost to beat back
insurgent attacks

151
00:07:53,924 --> 00:07:55,524
and defend their bases,

152
00:07:55,609 --> 00:07:57,309
but they certainly took
a huge amount of casualties.

153
00:07:57,394 --> 00:07:59,411
I think they had 94 guys
killed in action

154
00:07:59,513 --> 00:08:01,379
and several hundred
wounded, you know,

155
00:08:01,482 --> 00:08:03,048
in the 15 months
that they spent there.

156
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:05,116
The guys that were there
fighting before us,

157
00:08:05,219 --> 00:08:07,185
they had kind
of surrounded the city.

158
00:08:07,254 --> 00:08:11,456
but there was no
major combat outposts
inside the city.

159
00:08:11,492 --> 00:08:12,741
Tony Eafrati:
The conventional forces,

160
00:08:12,826 --> 00:08:14,242
all the things
they wanted to do

161
00:08:14,328 --> 00:08:17,195
building COPs,
you know, combat outposts.

162
00:08:17,281 --> 00:08:20,198
And forging relationships
with the local populace

163
00:08:20,284 --> 00:08:22,701
and the sheikhs
and all that, that's
kinda hard to do

164
00:08:22,769 --> 00:08:25,353
when you have
an untouched enemy force

165
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:26,938
who is just
running rampant

166
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:29,741
throughout that area.

167
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:32,043
Jocko Willink:
The other problem
is the urban environment.

168
00:08:32,129 --> 00:08:35,647
The enemy can fade
in and out of the populace
in a split second.

169
00:08:35,732 --> 00:08:38,550
All they have to do
is put down their weapon,
and they're a civilian.

170
00:08:38,619 --> 00:08:41,303
The IED threat
is completely,

171
00:08:41,421 --> 00:08:42,521
you know, horrible.

172
00:08:42,556 --> 00:08:44,122
( explosion )

173
00:08:44,224 --> 00:08:47,025
Improvised Explosive Device.
It's a roadside bomb.

174
00:08:47,127 --> 00:08:48,743
Jocko Willink:
In an urban environment,

175
00:08:48,829 --> 00:08:51,246
everything is man-made,
so anything could be an IED.

176
00:08:51,331 --> 00:08:53,631
They would make IEDs
look like curbs

177
00:08:53,734 --> 00:08:54,900
and look like brick walls

178
00:08:54,985 --> 00:08:58,103
and look like mailboxes
or whatever.

179
00:08:58,188 --> 00:09:00,505
Among military commanders,
there is a growing sense

180
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:02,641
that defeating
the enemy there

181
00:09:02,743 --> 00:09:04,726
may be impossible.

182
00:09:04,845 --> 00:09:06,678
Leif Babin:
There was a Marine Corps
intelligence report

183
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:08,213
that was leaked
to the press

184
00:09:08,315 --> 00:09:11,182
in the spring of,
of 2006.

185
00:09:11,285 --> 00:09:13,885
US forces are
militarily incapable

186
00:09:13,921 --> 00:09:17,489
of defeating the insurgency
in Ramadi and Al Anbar.

187
00:09:17,591 --> 00:09:21,192
It was described
as a, as an unwinnable
situation.

188
00:09:23,397 --> 00:09:26,314
Leif Babin:
What other people see
as impossible is possible

189
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:30,201
with the right folks
who believe in the mission.

190
00:09:30,287 --> 00:09:32,704
Guys like Marc Lee
really believed in this
mission,

191
00:09:32,789 --> 00:09:35,156
that we can,
we were trying to liberate
the Iraqi people

192
00:09:35,242 --> 00:09:38,443
from an evil insurgency.

193
00:09:38,545 --> 00:09:40,462
I, I totally believed
in what we were doing there.

194
00:09:40,581 --> 00:09:44,916
I mean, you know,
somebody has to kill
the bad guys.

195
00:09:45,002 --> 00:09:46,918
And I think we were
the best suited for that.

196
00:10:03,072 --> 00:10:04,839
Leif Babin:
When we showed up,
Ramadi,

197
00:10:04,891 --> 00:10:07,909
was a violent
terrorist stronghold,
a total war zone.

198
00:10:08,011 --> 00:10:10,011
TIME Magazine
had called it,

199
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:12,013
I think, the most dangerous
place in the world
at the time.

200
00:10:12,081 --> 00:10:14,048
Tony Eafrati:
It was bad there,

201
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:17,251
but I remember
the smell a lot.

202
00:10:17,337 --> 00:10:19,887
Physically, it stinks.

203
00:10:19,989 --> 00:10:22,156
But in the same breath
it's kind of like that...

204
00:10:22,258 --> 00:10:23,524
( sniffs )

205
00:10:23,626 --> 00:10:26,527
It's kind of war,
you know, so it...

206
00:10:26,629 --> 00:10:29,730
it's the slap in face
that kind of feels good.

207
00:10:31,634 --> 00:10:33,968
Jason Hogan:
It's just a whole
different world.

208
00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:35,803
Driving down the streets,

209
00:10:35,889 --> 00:10:39,674
it was almost like being
in a movie.

210
00:10:39,759 --> 00:10:41,292
Jocko Willink:
There would be
machine gun holes

211
00:10:41,377 --> 00:10:43,377
in all the buildings
and walls rubbled down,

212
00:10:43,446 --> 00:10:44,879
and that's what
it looked like.

213
00:10:44,981 --> 00:10:49,483
That's where I wanted
to be my whole life.

214
00:10:49,552 --> 00:10:51,152
When I was a little kid
I wanted to be some kind
of a soldier,

215
00:10:51,237 --> 00:10:53,988
some kind of a commando,
and I realized

216
00:10:54,073 --> 00:10:56,524
that there was guys
that were fighting and dying,
and I wasn't with them.

217
00:10:56,626 --> 00:11:00,661
And so I immediately
figured out how to get in.

218
00:11:00,730 --> 00:11:03,030
I heard that the SEALs
was a tough organization

219
00:11:03,132 --> 00:11:06,667
and hard to get through,
and that made me want to do it.

220
00:11:06,769 --> 00:11:09,937
It was just one
of those things that I was,
you know,

221
00:11:10,039 --> 00:11:13,407
I had inside my, my...

222
00:11:13,493 --> 00:11:15,276
I guess
inside my head or soul

223
00:11:15,345 --> 00:11:17,044
or whatever,
for lack of a better word.

224
00:11:17,130 --> 00:11:19,013
It's what I always wanted
to do since I was,

225
00:11:19,065 --> 00:11:20,514
since I could remember
wanting to do anything.

226
00:11:22,619 --> 00:11:24,919
Jason Hogan: Jocko
was a task unit commander.

227
00:11:24,988 --> 00:11:26,921
He was
an intimidating guy.

228
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:29,373
Um, I never saw
that man sleep.

229
00:11:29,492 --> 00:11:32,660
I, uh, he, I remember

230
00:11:32,762 --> 00:11:34,395
any time I woke up
in the morning,

231
00:11:34,497 --> 00:11:36,931
he was already up.
I went to bed at night,
he was still up.

232
00:11:37,033 --> 00:11:39,767
Jocko Willink:
If Ramadi would
have fallen,

233
00:11:39,869 --> 00:11:43,104
you would have
a very secure area

234
00:11:43,172 --> 00:11:45,156
for the insurgency
to grow.

235
00:11:45,241 --> 00:11:46,874
You can't have it fall
to the enemy.

236
00:11:46,976 --> 00:11:48,709
That's all there is to it.

237
00:11:59,939 --> 00:12:01,072
Leif Babin:
The Ready First Brigade
strategy

238
00:12:01,157 --> 00:12:02,757
of seize, clear, hold, build

239
00:12:02,859 --> 00:12:04,558
was about going into the worst
enemy held areas,

240
00:12:04,661 --> 00:12:09,096
seizing those areas,
building a permanent
combat outpost,

241
00:12:09,198 --> 00:12:12,033
and then moving out
into the enemy territory
from there,

242
00:12:12,135 --> 00:12:14,635
taking them back
one neighborhood at a time.

243
00:12:14,704 --> 00:12:18,439
It was a radical strategy.
There were people that thought
that was crazy.

244
00:12:18,508 --> 00:12:20,441
Of course for us,
we initially thought,

245
00:12:20,476 --> 00:12:21,859
how can we get
into those areas, right?

246
00:12:21,945 --> 00:12:23,327
'Cause if that's
where the bad guys are,

247
00:12:23,413 --> 00:12:26,447
that's where we can have
the most impact.

248
00:12:26,499 --> 00:12:29,083
To be able
to go into the worst
enemy held areas

249
00:12:29,152 --> 00:12:31,052
to build a combat outpost,

250
00:12:31,137 --> 00:12:33,387
we had to bring
a massive amount of firepower
with us.

251
00:12:37,276 --> 00:12:40,494
Jocko Willink:
Marc Lee was
a machine gunner.

252
00:12:40,596 --> 00:12:42,430
And a damn good one.

253
00:12:42,482 --> 00:12:44,515
Leif Babin:
When you're under attack,

254
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:46,200
and a dozen bad guys
are trying to overrun
your position,

255
00:12:46,302 --> 00:12:49,153
it's the machine gunners
that keep you alive.

256
00:12:49,238 --> 00:12:51,255
Jason Hogan:
I was the same as Marc.

257
00:12:51,374 --> 00:12:53,741
I did the Mark 48,
call it 60 gunner.

258
00:12:53,843 --> 00:12:57,211
If you don't have a 60 gun
on your team there,

259
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:59,613
you're not moving
anywhere, really.

260
00:12:59,666 --> 00:13:01,699
Jocko Willink:
They had to lay down
suppressive fire

261
00:13:01,784 --> 00:13:03,300
and keep
the enemy head down,

262
00:13:03,386 --> 00:13:04,952
so that we could
maneuver to safety

263
00:13:05,021 --> 00:13:06,454
or maneuver
to a more aggressive
position.

264
00:13:06,556 --> 00:13:08,022
Marc was just
absolutely fearless.

265
00:13:08,124 --> 00:13:09,290
He'd stand out there
in the middle of the street

266
00:13:09,392 --> 00:13:10,825
with rounds ricocheting
all around him,

267
00:13:10,927 --> 00:13:13,511
and just lay down fire,
running through the streets

268
00:13:13,629 --> 00:13:15,179
with that big
automatic weapon.

269
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:31,445
Tony Eafrati:
You know, being
a machine gunner,

270
00:13:31,547 --> 00:13:33,514
if you're
really good at it,

271
00:13:33,583 --> 00:13:35,282
man, you're
such an asset.

272
00:13:35,385 --> 00:13:38,419
Guys like Marc, who were
like big, rugged frogmen

273
00:13:38,471 --> 00:13:41,688
who can really carry
a lot of rounds and really
lay it down,

274
00:13:41,741 --> 00:13:43,491
they're well worth
their weight in gold.

275
00:13:43,543 --> 00:13:44,692
Going into these
neighborhoods

276
00:13:44,761 --> 00:13:46,010
involved bad guys
shooting at us,

277
00:13:46,095 --> 00:13:48,829
us exchanging some fire
with those bad guys,

278
00:13:48,931 --> 00:13:49,980
being able
to beat them back,

279
00:13:50,099 --> 00:13:51,198
and us coming
back home and,

280
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:55,469
you know,
with everybody intact.

281
00:13:55,571 --> 00:13:57,138
Jason Hogan:
Leif and Jocko,

282
00:13:57,206 --> 00:13:59,690
they were always pushing it,
uh, getting us ops.

283
00:13:59,776 --> 00:14:02,743
They did a good job
getting us in the fight.

284
00:14:02,845 --> 00:14:06,447
Combat Outpost Falcon,
or COP Falcon was, uh,

285
00:14:06,549 --> 00:14:08,315
was right
at a key intersection

286
00:14:08,384 --> 00:14:09,717
in this really bad area.

287
00:14:09,819 --> 00:14:12,586
It was a total Al-Qaeda
battle space.

288
00:14:12,655 --> 00:14:14,755
That's where
the bad guys are,
I mean...

289
00:14:14,824 --> 00:14:16,741
So when they wanted
to go in there

290
00:14:16,826 --> 00:14:18,526
and put
a Combat Outpost there,

291
00:14:18,628 --> 00:14:19,693
we were overjoyed.

292
00:14:19,779 --> 00:14:20,895
We thought it was great.

293
00:14:20,997 --> 00:14:22,379
That, that was
kind of a,

294
00:14:22,465 --> 00:14:23,864
kind of a big operation
we did,

295
00:14:23,933 --> 00:14:26,751
and it was
pretty cool, too.

296
00:14:26,836 --> 00:14:29,503
Leif Babin: We were gonna be
the lead element to support
the guys coming in.

297
00:14:29,605 --> 00:14:32,089
So we saw right away
that us being come
from the water,

298
00:14:32,175 --> 00:14:35,276
the river's right here,
let's go in our boats.

299
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:41,715
Tony Eafrati:
There's a canal back there
off the Euphrates,

300
00:14:41,818 --> 00:14:42,983
and they didn't
IED any boats.

301
00:14:45,154 --> 00:14:46,587
We'd slipped in
on the riverbank

302
00:14:46,672 --> 00:14:48,422
and patrolled in.

303
00:14:53,830 --> 00:14:55,863
Chris Kyle was actually
our point man.

304
00:14:55,915 --> 00:14:58,799
I was right behind him
as the patrol leader.

305
00:14:58,901 --> 00:15:00,985
Chris kind of halts
the patrol for a second,

306
00:15:01,070 --> 00:15:04,738
and he starts changing
his battery out on his laser,
on his weapon.

307
00:15:04,807 --> 00:15:07,308
I was like, dude,
what are you, what are you
doing, man?

308
00:15:07,410 --> 00:15:09,109
We, we gotta keep moving.

309
00:15:09,162 --> 00:15:10,211
He doesn't have
a working laser,

310
00:15:10,246 --> 00:15:12,045
and we come
to the end of a,

311
00:15:12,148 --> 00:15:15,749
kind of a dark alleyway,
and I see Chris just
kind of freeze.

312
00:15:15,818 --> 00:15:18,385
Not 25 yards away from us,
there's a bad guy.

313
00:15:18,488 --> 00:15:20,171
A Mujahideen fighter
is standing there

314
00:15:20,256 --> 00:15:22,723
with a keffiyeh wrapped
around his face and AK-47.

315
00:15:22,792 --> 00:15:24,692
I mean,
he's 25 yards away.

316
00:15:24,794 --> 00:15:25,860
Chris can't
accurately shoot him

317
00:15:25,962 --> 00:15:27,912
because he doesn't
have a laser.

318
00:15:27,997 --> 00:15:29,713
I had to come up
and take that shot
over his shoulder.

319
00:15:29,799 --> 00:15:31,532
( gunfire )

320
00:15:33,069 --> 00:15:35,102
Chris had 101 confirmed kills
from our deployment,

321
00:15:35,171 --> 00:15:36,670
and yet he never
forgave me

322
00:15:36,772 --> 00:15:37,805
for taking that away
from him.

323
00:15:37,874 --> 00:15:41,408
So, we smoked
that bad guy.

324
00:15:41,511 --> 00:15:45,712
Smoked, that means
killed, eliminated.

325
00:15:45,765 --> 00:15:48,482
And then we moved
on to COP Falcon.

326
00:15:51,354 --> 00:15:52,736
We went in and cleared
this building.

327
00:15:54,624 --> 00:15:57,341
Put snipers
up on the rooftop
and in windows,

328
00:15:57,426 --> 00:15:59,960
and then we covered
the movement for all
the big heavy equipment

329
00:16:00,062 --> 00:16:01,695
that was coming in to build
the Combat Outpost.

330
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:06,600
It's about working
together as a team.

331
00:16:06,702 --> 00:16:08,769
Snipers can only stay

332
00:16:08,871 --> 00:16:11,121
for maybe two
or three hours maximum
before they get fatigued.

333
00:16:11,207 --> 00:16:13,841
And so guys like Marc,
who's a machine gunner,
and wasn't a sniper,

334
00:16:13,943 --> 00:16:16,177
but he'd rotate
in and man those positions.

335
00:16:16,245 --> 00:16:18,846
I think there was
something like 50 tanks
involved in this

336
00:16:18,948 --> 00:16:22,416
and probably,
probably 800 to 1,000
soldiers.

337
00:16:22,518 --> 00:16:25,402
It was, it was
a huge, huge operation.

338
00:16:25,488 --> 00:16:27,555
And, I was
proud that we were

339
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:29,473
the lead element on it.

340
00:16:30,593 --> 00:16:35,262
Leif, Leif Babin.

341
00:16:35,331 --> 00:16:37,064
We just kinda hit it off.

342
00:16:37,133 --> 00:16:39,567
We had the same goals
that we set for,

343
00:16:39,635 --> 00:16:41,969
for the platoon
and where we wanted to go.

344
00:16:42,038 --> 00:16:46,540
Leif was our OIC,
Officer in Charge
of our platoon.

345
00:16:46,609 --> 00:16:48,108
Leif Babin: I spent
13 years in the Navy,

346
00:16:48,211 --> 00:16:51,044
nine years
as a Navy SEAL.

347
00:16:51,147 --> 00:16:54,081
I grew up in the piney woods
of Southeast Texas,

348
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:55,549
playing
with my Army men,

349
00:16:55,651 --> 00:16:57,151
G.I. Joe figures
out in the sandbox.

350
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:58,719
I always knew
I wanted to be a combat leader.

351
00:16:58,788 --> 00:17:00,788
That's what I wanted
to do with my life.

352
00:17:00,856 --> 00:17:04,024
My dad served in the Army
and the Air Force.

353
00:17:04,126 --> 00:17:06,160
I'm one of five siblings,
but I'm the only one

354
00:17:06,229 --> 00:17:09,763
that decided that
that's what I wanted to do.

355
00:17:09,832 --> 00:17:13,300
I went to the Naval Academy
to pursue that dream.

356
00:17:13,402 --> 00:17:14,802
Throughout
the SEAL teams,

357
00:17:14,870 --> 00:17:16,670
I think,
no matter how tough
things got,

358
00:17:16,756 --> 00:17:19,456
I think having
the attitude of,
thank God I'm here,

359
00:17:19,542 --> 00:17:21,425
You know,
I actually got the chance
to do what I wanted to do

360
00:17:21,544 --> 00:17:23,844
and what I dreamed about.

361
00:17:26,382 --> 00:17:28,766
The reality is, yeah,
there's some tough stuff,

362
00:17:28,851 --> 00:17:30,134
but you just gotta look
in the mirror hard

363
00:17:30,219 --> 00:17:32,019
and say,
"this is what I want
to do,

364
00:17:32,104 --> 00:17:35,189
and I'm gonna overcome
any challenge necessary
to do that."

365
00:17:35,274 --> 00:17:37,924
And in what became known
as the Battle of Ramadi,

366
00:17:38,027 --> 00:17:40,894
we would be truly tested.

367
00:17:58,009 --> 00:17:59,809
COP Falcon
gave us a foothold

368
00:17:59,911 --> 00:18:01,811
into this worst
enemy held area

369
00:18:01,913 --> 00:18:03,829
of south central Ramadi.

370
00:18:03,915 --> 00:18:06,282
Jason Hogan:
We just ran operations
out of there after that,

371
00:18:06,384 --> 00:18:09,819
just because it was easier
than going back all the way
to Camp Ramadi.

372
00:18:09,904 --> 00:18:11,887
Leif Babin: The whole time
that the US Marines
and soldiers

373
00:18:11,989 --> 00:18:14,323
were building
those Combat Outposts
throughout the city,

374
00:18:14,425 --> 00:18:16,725
we had sniper teams
in place supporting
those guys.

375
00:18:16,828 --> 00:18:18,444
We formed
a huge relationship
with them,

376
00:18:18,529 --> 00:18:19,879
because they realized
how we could protect them,

377
00:18:19,997 --> 00:18:21,831
and of course
we relied on them

378
00:18:21,899 --> 00:18:25,034
when they, you know,
we needed them to come out
and help us.

379
00:18:25,102 --> 00:18:27,903
I mean, that happened
very often.

380
00:18:29,907 --> 00:18:31,740
Jason Hogan:
We did work hand-in-hand
with the Army,

381
00:18:31,793 --> 00:18:34,009
and we just would keep
pushing forward,

382
00:18:34,061 --> 00:18:36,245
pushing forward,
pushing forward.

383
00:18:36,347 --> 00:18:38,848
It was my first time
going overseas like this,

384
00:18:38,916 --> 00:18:40,549
uh, first time
in combat,

385
00:18:40,618 --> 00:18:42,334
and from the time
I joined the Navy

386
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:44,119
to the time I actually
got to go over there
was three years.

387
00:18:44,188 --> 00:18:46,655
Three years of training
and I was just thinking,

388
00:18:46,724 --> 00:18:50,409
"man, finally,
I get to do my job now,
why I signed up."

389
00:18:53,064 --> 00:18:54,863
When I decided
to be a SEAL,

390
00:18:54,966 --> 00:18:56,698
I was bored with my life
at the time.

391
00:18:56,801 --> 00:18:59,502
I was just going to college
playing football.

392
00:18:59,587 --> 00:19:00,769
It's just a small little
school.

393
00:19:00,872 --> 00:19:02,738
I just wanted
something more to do,

394
00:19:02,807 --> 00:19:04,707
something that was
challenging.

395
00:19:04,809 --> 00:19:06,292
September 11th happened.

396
00:19:06,410 --> 00:19:08,711
That was some stuff
I had talked about with my dad,

397
00:19:08,813 --> 00:19:10,012
like I wanted
to be part of something.

398
00:19:10,081 --> 00:19:12,047
I wanted to be part
of doing good.

399
00:19:12,149 --> 00:19:14,450
I wanted to go do something
that I thought mattered,

400
00:19:14,519 --> 00:19:16,285
and I thought that was it.

401
00:19:16,354 --> 00:19:18,354
I thought joining the,
becoming a Navy SEAL was it.

402
00:19:21,526 --> 00:19:23,526
Tony Eafrati:
Jason was a new guy.

403
00:19:23,594 --> 00:19:26,512
A lot of them guys are new,
and, uh, they came in

404
00:19:26,597 --> 00:19:28,964
with a really good attitude

405
00:19:29,066 --> 00:19:31,500
that, you know,
whatever it is,
we'll do it.

406
00:19:31,602 --> 00:19:35,170
And we did some
crazy ( bleep ).

407
00:19:35,239 --> 00:19:38,290
We did
over watch operations.

408
00:19:38,409 --> 00:19:41,143
An over watch operation
is going into an area,

409
00:19:41,229 --> 00:19:43,929
99% of the time
over there in Ramadi

410
00:19:44,048 --> 00:19:46,248
it was a building.

411
00:19:46,317 --> 00:19:48,083
And just sit there
on the scopes

412
00:19:48,152 --> 00:19:50,286
and watch
and watch and watch.

413
00:19:50,371 --> 00:19:53,906
So anywhere there
are insurgents trying
to lay in an ambush,

414
00:19:53,991 --> 00:19:56,425
we'd get 'em.

415
00:19:56,477 --> 00:19:59,962
Leif Babin: So much
of the Iraq war was fought
on the defensive.

416
00:20:00,064 --> 00:20:02,197
For us,
sniper over watches
were a way

417
00:20:02,283 --> 00:20:06,435
to take the offensive
and really take the fight
to the enemy.

418
00:20:06,504 --> 00:20:09,338
( gunshot )

419
00:20:09,407 --> 00:20:11,790
Leif Babin: When we'd go
in our sniper over watch
positions,

420
00:20:11,876 --> 00:20:14,576
we'd go in under cover
of darkness at 2:00 or 3:00
in the morning.

421
00:20:14,679 --> 00:20:17,263
The first early morning
call to prayer,

422
00:20:17,381 --> 00:20:19,815
is it happens
just before daylight,
and so, you know,

423
00:20:19,884 --> 00:20:22,318
those are, you know
the city is gonna awaken.

424
00:20:22,403 --> 00:20:23,586
And we're kind
of waiting to hear that

425
00:20:23,688 --> 00:20:24,920
because that's
kind of a signal

426
00:20:25,006 --> 00:20:27,256
that the enemy might
rally to that.

427
00:20:27,325 --> 00:20:30,459
Marc Lee, he was very good
at imitating those.

428
00:20:30,528 --> 00:20:34,163
He would be like--
( mimics call to prayer )

429
00:20:34,231 --> 00:20:35,965
And he'd kick
that thing off,

430
00:20:36,033 --> 00:20:37,199
and you'd be like,

431
00:20:37,301 --> 00:20:39,001
"Dude, is it--
what time is it?"

432
00:20:39,103 --> 00:20:40,869
And you realize,
"Oh it's you, dude,
shut up, " you know.

433
00:20:40,938 --> 00:20:43,739
So he'd, he got
the best of me a few times
on that, definitely.

434
00:20:43,841 --> 00:20:45,841
Jason Hogan:
Marc, he always had
a good attitude,

435
00:20:45,943 --> 00:20:48,644
even when things
were horrible.

436
00:20:52,583 --> 00:20:54,950
Leif Babin:
As daybreak comes,
first call to prayer went off

437
00:20:55,019 --> 00:20:56,652
in, in,
in the early morning,

438
00:20:56,754 --> 00:20:58,187
and the city
kinda comes alive,

439
00:20:58,289 --> 00:21:00,255
and we started seeing
bad guys moving around.

440
00:21:00,324 --> 00:21:01,957
Our snipers start
taking shots

441
00:21:02,026 --> 00:21:03,525
and hammering
enemy fighters.

442
00:21:03,594 --> 00:21:05,427
And then, you know,

443
00:21:05,479 --> 00:21:06,996
they start
shooting back at us.

444
00:21:07,098 --> 00:21:09,999
We got thousands
of rounds shot at us.

445
00:21:10,101 --> 00:21:13,268
( gunfire )

446
00:21:13,354 --> 00:21:15,170
I think it was Marc
and some of the other guys

447
00:21:15,272 --> 00:21:16,338
were just looking
at each other,

448
00:21:16,407 --> 00:21:17,806
just laughing.

449
00:21:20,194 --> 00:21:21,610
I remember crawling
into the room there

450
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:23,479
and be like,
"hey, you guys all right?"

451
00:21:23,564 --> 00:21:25,114
It's like rounds
are just coming in
and just shattering glass,

452
00:21:25,199 --> 00:21:27,216
and literally inches
over guys' heads,

453
00:21:27,284 --> 00:21:30,302
and they were just like,
"Damn, these guys can shoot."

454
00:21:30,388 --> 00:21:32,221
And Tony's standing
in the corner,

455
00:21:32,289 --> 00:21:33,872
and rounds are
bracketing him

456
00:21:33,991 --> 00:21:36,458
coming in two
different windows,

457
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:37,893
and he's kind of just up
against the concrete,

458
00:21:37,995 --> 00:21:39,378
and he just looks at
me as, like,

459
00:21:39,463 --> 00:21:40,896
gives me a smile,
like a thumbs-up,

460
00:21:40,982 --> 00:21:42,448
was like, "This is,
this is crazy."

461
00:21:45,636 --> 00:21:49,071
So you're in a war zone.
It's combat, it sucks,

462
00:21:49,156 --> 00:21:53,325
it's hard, you know,
and fun at the same time.

463
00:21:53,411 --> 00:21:55,344
But I was very fortunate

464
00:21:55,446 --> 00:21:56,478
to be in a leadership
position

465
00:21:56,547 --> 00:21:59,048
in that platoon
at that time.

466
00:21:59,116 --> 00:22:00,683
Tony Eafrati
was the platoon chief,

467
00:22:00,751 --> 00:22:03,118
so he was the senior
enlisted guy.

468
00:22:03,187 --> 00:22:04,787
Tony Eafrati:
I wanted to be a SEAL.

469
00:22:04,872 --> 00:22:07,339
I wanted to go in the Navy
since I was like a teenager.

470
00:22:07,458 --> 00:22:10,125
My grandfather was
a B-17 pilot

471
00:22:10,194 --> 00:22:11,510
in World War II.

472
00:22:11,629 --> 00:22:12,895
My dad was in
during the Vietnam War,

473
00:22:12,997 --> 00:22:14,863
and my brother
was in the Air Force.

474
00:22:14,932 --> 00:22:16,665
I went over 20 years
in the Navy,

475
00:22:16,734 --> 00:22:19,301
and then I made Chief.

476
00:22:19,370 --> 00:22:22,538
As an enlisted frogman,
that's what you want to be.

477
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:24,373
Best job I ever had.

478
00:22:24,442 --> 00:22:27,109
Especially when you got
a really good team, you know.

479
00:22:27,178 --> 00:22:30,012
You just, you're really part
of something special.

480
00:22:30,081 --> 00:22:31,780
Leif Babin:
The strength of SEAL teams
is our team.

481
00:22:31,882 --> 00:22:34,583
You know, it's, it's,
it's our brotherhood.

482
00:22:34,652 --> 00:22:35,834
The reality is,
in combat,

483
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:37,152
yeah, there's
some tough stuff,

484
00:22:37,254 --> 00:22:39,621
but most of it
was an absolute blast.

485
00:22:39,724 --> 00:22:41,957
We were fighting
a very evil enemy,

486
00:22:42,059 --> 00:22:43,625
and, and we knew
we were making a difference,

487
00:22:43,728 --> 00:22:45,894
we knew we were
having an impact.

488
00:22:45,996 --> 00:22:47,362
We stirred up
the hornet's nest,

489
00:22:47,448 --> 00:22:50,432
but it was right
where we wanted to be.

490
00:22:50,534 --> 00:22:54,920
Tony Eafrati:
To me the strategy
for defeating ISIS

491
00:22:55,005 --> 00:22:57,005
is one ISIS guy,
put a bullet in his head.

492
00:22:57,041 --> 00:22:58,674
That guy is done,
onto the next one.

493
00:22:58,759 --> 00:23:01,009
How many of them,
a hundred thousand of them?

494
00:23:01,045 --> 00:23:03,578
Okay, get 100,000 bullets.
Job done.

495
00:23:03,681 --> 00:23:05,931
That's our part
of this mission.

496
00:23:13,844 --> 00:23:15,978
Leif Babin: Throughout
the months that Charlie Platoon
spent in Ramadi,

497
00:23:16,030 --> 00:23:17,379
we were a part
of probably

498
00:23:17,481 --> 00:23:20,149
at least five or six
major Combat Outposts.

499
00:23:20,217 --> 00:23:21,984
Jocko Willink:
We could feel
the progress.

500
00:23:22,086 --> 00:23:23,419
I mean, there's
a finite number of bad guys

501
00:23:23,487 --> 00:23:25,771
that are willing
to martyr themselves,

502
00:23:25,856 --> 00:23:28,991
and so we dug in
to try and see

503
00:23:29,093 --> 00:23:31,510
where that bottom was.

504
00:23:31,595 --> 00:23:33,462
But you gotta realize
there's gonna be risk

505
00:23:33,564 --> 00:23:35,297
on every operation you do,
and that's one thing that,

506
00:23:35,399 --> 00:23:38,033
you know, we definitely
had to deal with.

507
00:23:47,845 --> 00:23:52,281
I always had,
like, this thing that
we're invincible.

508
00:23:52,366 --> 00:23:53,982
Just like the other units
thought we were invincible,

509
00:23:54,085 --> 00:23:55,884
I thought we were, too.

510
00:23:55,986 --> 00:23:57,486
I don't know
how the older guys were,

511
00:23:57,555 --> 00:24:00,656
'cause they'd been there
and done that before.

512
00:24:03,761 --> 00:24:05,728
You actually know

513
00:24:05,830 --> 00:24:07,563
that somebody's
gonna get killed
or wounded.

514
00:24:07,665 --> 00:24:11,233
I mean you--
It's, it's, you--

515
00:24:11,302 --> 00:24:13,202
I mean,
I actually knew it.

516
00:24:13,270 --> 00:24:14,703
There's no way
you could stop it.

517
00:24:14,805 --> 00:24:16,405
You know that
it's gonna happen.

518
00:24:16,474 --> 00:24:18,173
I mean,
we can only be lucky

519
00:24:18,275 --> 00:24:21,376
so many times
in a row.

520
00:24:21,479 --> 00:24:23,979
And you can only mitigate
the risk so much.

521
00:24:24,081 --> 00:24:26,515
And you roll out there
with all those threats

522
00:24:26,617 --> 00:24:30,369
and all that evil
that's there.

523
00:24:30,454 --> 00:24:34,339
And you know
that at some point

524
00:24:34,425 --> 00:24:35,624
it's gonna happen.

525
00:24:50,107 --> 00:24:52,174
Leif Babin: Uh, we were
conducting a big operation

526
00:24:52,276 --> 00:24:54,343
with the Army's
Team Bulldog.

527
00:24:54,445 --> 00:24:56,278
We work very closely
with these awesome soldiers

528
00:24:56,347 --> 00:24:59,715
that we'd formed
a tremendous brotherhood with.

529
00:24:59,817 --> 00:25:03,152
And we were doing
a cordoned search operation
with Iraqi soldiers.

530
00:25:03,254 --> 00:25:05,187
Basically moving,
like, block-by-block,

531
00:25:05,239 --> 00:25:08,323
house-by-house,
through an area.

532
00:25:08,409 --> 00:25:11,393
On August 2,
the bad guys decided
that they were gonna,

533
00:25:11,462 --> 00:25:12,828
they were gonna fight
for this territory

534
00:25:12,897 --> 00:25:15,147
in a way that we hadn't
seen it before.

535
00:25:15,232 --> 00:25:19,234
Marc was with me
and the clearance team
with Iraqi soldiers.

536
00:25:19,336 --> 00:25:20,853
We were moving through
and house to house.

537
00:25:20,938 --> 00:25:22,187
We had a sniper team
on the rooftop.

538
00:25:22,273 --> 00:25:23,472
Chris Kyle was there
as our sniper.

539
00:25:23,541 --> 00:25:26,542
Ryan Jobe
was our machine gunner

540
00:25:26,610 --> 00:25:27,960
with Chris and a couple
of other SEALs

541
00:25:28,045 --> 00:25:30,212
and some Iraqis
that were with them.

542
00:25:30,314 --> 00:25:33,165
We were about to move down
into another building,

543
00:25:33,250 --> 00:25:34,983
and so as I walked
down the stairs,

544
00:25:35,085 --> 00:25:37,719
I just hear a gunshot,
a single gunshot.

545
00:25:37,771 --> 00:25:39,054
( gunshot )

546
00:25:41,408 --> 00:25:44,510
And I just, I just could hear
Chris Kyle's voice.

547
00:25:44,628 --> 00:25:46,345
( shouting )

548
00:25:46,430 --> 00:25:47,763
He came up over the radio

549
00:25:47,865 --> 00:25:49,431
and told us
that we had a man down

550
00:25:49,533 --> 00:25:53,619
and we needed a corpsman
on the roof right away.

551
00:25:53,704 --> 00:25:58,207
Jason Hogan:
I was in the next
building over...

552
00:25:58,309 --> 00:26:00,008
and we had heard
somebody got hit
on the radio,

553
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:01,877
and we didn't--
I didn't know who
at the time.

554
00:26:01,979 --> 00:26:04,496
Didn't know
the extent of it.

555
00:26:04,582 --> 00:26:05,631
Leif Babin:
We rushed to the rooftop,

556
00:26:05,716 --> 00:26:06,849
me and a couple
of other guys,

557
00:26:06,951 --> 00:26:08,717
and immediately
got to Ryan.

558
00:26:08,786 --> 00:26:10,819
He had been hit,
hit in the head,

559
00:26:10,888 --> 00:26:13,154
and, and it was--
It just looked horrific.

560
00:26:13,257 --> 00:26:15,457
You know, there was no way
we thought he could even
possibly survive that.

561
00:26:15,509 --> 00:26:17,492
I just grabbed
his hand, I said,
"Hang in there brother,

562
00:26:17,595 --> 00:26:20,979
we're gonna, we're gonna
get you out of here."

563
00:26:21,065 --> 00:26:22,931
Tony Eafrati:
I was on an opposite
building.

564
00:26:23,033 --> 00:26:24,833
I mean, we were all
in the same group

565
00:26:24,935 --> 00:26:28,537
doing this like
huge operation.

566
00:26:28,589 --> 00:26:30,305
We called in
the ground medevac

567
00:26:30,407 --> 00:26:32,257
to get him out of there.

568
00:26:32,343 --> 00:26:34,142
And meanwhile, we got
an enemy sniper out there,

569
00:26:34,245 --> 00:26:37,980
we got one single round
that had hit a guy
and put him down.

570
00:26:38,048 --> 00:26:39,581
So, one of the most
courageous things

571
00:26:39,683 --> 00:26:41,016
I ever saw anybody do

572
00:26:41,118 --> 00:26:43,585
was Marc Lee
grabbing his machine gun

573
00:26:43,671 --> 00:26:45,437
and stepping right up
into the very position

574
00:26:45,522 --> 00:26:47,239
where Ryan just got shot,

575
00:26:47,324 --> 00:26:49,908
and just laying down
suppressive fire for us.

576
00:26:52,396 --> 00:26:55,397
So we got Ryan
onto, you know,

577
00:26:55,499 --> 00:26:57,599
to help
and got him evacuated.

578
00:27:00,938 --> 00:27:04,139
So after that,
all hell broke loose.

579
00:27:04,224 --> 00:27:05,941
There were just people
coming out of the woodwork,

580
00:27:06,043 --> 00:27:08,844
insurgents shooting
at soldiers,

581
00:27:08,929 --> 00:27:11,179
as well as us.

582
00:27:11,282 --> 00:27:12,648
We figured we got
a sniper out here.

583
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:15,233
We gotta move back
to Combat Outpost Falcon.

584
00:27:15,319 --> 00:27:16,985
( gunfire )

585
00:27:21,091 --> 00:27:22,424
Jason Hogan:
After Ryan was hit,

586
00:27:22,493 --> 00:27:26,695
people were
a little shaken by that.

587
00:27:26,764 --> 00:27:27,879
It hadn't
happened before.

588
00:27:27,998 --> 00:27:29,798
We hadn't taken
any casualties.

589
00:27:29,867 --> 00:27:34,136
We had always been
the people killing, really.

590
00:27:34,204 --> 00:27:36,738
It was a first time
for any of us for that.

591
00:27:38,676 --> 00:27:40,275
Leif Babin:
But when we got back
to COP Falcon,

592
00:27:40,377 --> 00:27:41,576
we hadn't finished
our cordoned search
operation,

593
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:42,911
but the Army troops
were still out

594
00:27:43,013 --> 00:27:44,546
in the midst of that,

595
00:27:44,648 --> 00:27:46,381
and they were
getting shot at
from all directions.

596
00:27:46,483 --> 00:27:48,817
We could hear the gunfire,
and they asked for our help.

597
00:27:48,919 --> 00:27:50,819
They said, "We need
some help out here."

598
00:27:50,904 --> 00:27:53,488
And so, you know,
for me as a platoon commander,

599
00:27:53,557 --> 00:27:54,923
that's a tough decision
to make, you know.

600
00:27:55,025 --> 00:27:57,125
But I had to make
that decision and say,

601
00:27:57,194 --> 00:27:58,694
"We can sit
in the camp here,

602
00:27:58,762 --> 00:28:02,965
or we can go out
and help these guys."

603
00:28:03,033 --> 00:28:06,702
Tony Eafrati:
Well when Ryan got shot,

604
00:28:06,804 --> 00:28:10,339
Marc was just
getting after it
and laying it down.

605
00:28:10,441 --> 00:28:12,674
I remember
when we came back,
and I'm like,

606
00:28:12,726 --> 00:28:16,128
"Hey, Marc, you did
a good job there, chum,
you know, real good."

607
00:28:16,213 --> 00:28:18,296
And he's like,
"Yeah, thanks, Ton."

608
00:28:18,382 --> 00:28:21,049
And I went,
"Well, what are you
waiting for?

609
00:28:21,118 --> 00:28:24,819
Reload your ( bleep ),
you know, 'cause we're
gonna go back out."

610
00:28:24,922 --> 00:28:26,588
He's like, "All right,"
you know, and he just,

611
00:28:26,623 --> 00:28:28,990
"Roger that,"
and just carried on.

612
00:28:29,093 --> 00:28:32,344
But, that's
the last thing
I said to him.

613
00:28:52,726 --> 00:28:54,159
Leif Babin:
After Ryan was wounded,

614
00:28:54,261 --> 00:28:55,927
the Army, they gave
us some reports

615
00:28:55,963 --> 00:28:57,462
of, we're getting shot at
from this building.

616
00:28:57,564 --> 00:28:59,965
So we loaded our guys up
and vehicles to go out and,

617
00:29:00,067 --> 00:29:02,434
and try to get
those bad guys.

618
00:29:06,173 --> 00:29:07,739
Jason Hogan:
We got in some Bradleys,

619
00:29:07,791 --> 00:29:10,241
went to the first house
and cleared it.

620
00:29:12,613 --> 00:29:16,181
No problem there.
Got back in the Bradleys.

621
00:29:16,283 --> 00:29:19,150
Then we went
to the next place.

622
00:29:26,143 --> 00:29:27,409
Marc looks over at me
and he's like,

623
00:29:27,527 --> 00:29:29,527
"Hey, I'll race
you to the door."

624
00:29:29,613 --> 00:29:31,596
So we raced to the door.
I end up winning.

625
00:29:31,698 --> 00:29:35,517
I go in the first room,
and he goes down to the end
of the hallway.

626
00:29:35,636 --> 00:29:38,236
Leif Babin:
And as we moved
into that building,

627
00:29:38,322 --> 00:29:40,538
we started taking fire
from an adjacent building.

628
00:29:40,641 --> 00:29:42,440
( gunfire )

629
00:29:42,476 --> 00:29:44,142
Jason Hogan:
Bullets start flying
down the hallway,

630
00:29:44,244 --> 00:29:45,810
right when I was coming out
of the first room.

631
00:29:45,879 --> 00:29:47,529
Leif was standing
right in front of me.

632
00:29:47,614 --> 00:29:49,564
He jumped into me,
hit me, knocked me back
into the room.

633
00:29:49,683 --> 00:29:50,849
He may have saved my life,
I don't know.

634
00:29:50,951 --> 00:29:52,050
If I had walked
out in that hallway,

635
00:29:52,152 --> 00:29:54,019
I might've gotten hit

636
00:29:54,071 --> 00:29:56,221
because he ended up
getting hit in the lat
by one of those rounds.

637
00:29:56,323 --> 00:29:58,039
And so Marc
stepped up in a window

638
00:29:58,158 --> 00:30:00,008
to, you know,
engage enemy fire

639
00:30:00,093 --> 00:30:01,159
and protect
the guys behind him

640
00:30:01,261 --> 00:30:03,294
and was struck.

641
00:30:03,397 --> 00:30:05,864
( gunshot )

642
00:30:11,171 --> 00:30:13,405
Leif Babin:
We evacuated him
as a casualty,

643
00:30:13,507 --> 00:30:15,306
sent our corpsman
with him, you know,

644
00:30:15,409 --> 00:30:16,374
corpsman tried
to do his best,

645
00:30:16,443 --> 00:30:18,009
utmost to work on him,

646
00:30:18,078 --> 00:30:20,278
but he had been
shot in the head
and killed instantly.

647
00:30:20,347 --> 00:30:21,680
And there was nothing
anybody could do about it.

648
00:30:21,782 --> 00:30:22,847
And it was,
it was horrific,

649
00:30:22,949 --> 00:30:24,716
absolutely horrific.

650
00:30:33,427 --> 00:30:36,995
I was in the Tactical
Operations Center
that morning.

651
00:30:37,064 --> 00:30:40,098
Leif got on one
of the COP's radios
and called.

652
00:30:40,167 --> 00:30:42,233
With so much emotion
in his voice

653
00:30:42,335 --> 00:30:45,403
that it almost sounded
emotionless,

654
00:30:45,505 --> 00:30:47,772
said "We had
another casualty.

655
00:30:47,874 --> 00:30:50,475
I think he's KIA.

656
00:30:50,577 --> 00:30:53,812
Killed In Action.

657
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:56,448
This radio net was monitored
by the entire brigade,

658
00:30:56,516 --> 00:30:59,984
so we were both doing our best
to remain professional.

659
00:31:00,036 --> 00:31:02,920
To prevent names of casualties
from leaking out,

660
00:31:03,023 --> 00:31:05,356
we do not use names
on the radio.

661
00:31:05,425 --> 00:31:08,960
'Roger, who is
the casualty?'

662
00:31:10,964 --> 00:31:13,064
There was a pause,

663
00:31:13,133 --> 00:31:16,201
and then he responded,

664
00:31:16,303 --> 00:31:19,204
'Charlie 1-4.'

665
00:31:19,306 --> 00:31:21,840
I looked up
at the board slowly.

666
00:31:21,942 --> 00:31:23,875
I didn't want
to see the name,

667
00:31:23,944 --> 00:31:26,010
but there it was,

668
00:31:26,113 --> 00:31:29,831
Charlie 1-4,
Marc Lee.

669
00:31:35,756 --> 00:31:37,822
I couldn't believe it.

670
00:31:37,908 --> 00:31:40,759
Our pillar of courage
and faith."

671
00:31:44,564 --> 00:31:47,265
He was my best friend
in the platoon, by far.

672
00:31:47,367 --> 00:31:50,268
I'd been with him
since the day when I lived
with him for two years,

673
00:31:50,370 --> 00:31:54,322
and he's gone now.
It's like, just like that.

674
00:31:54,407 --> 00:31:56,324
I just went over
and sat on my rack,

675
00:31:56,409 --> 00:32:00,695
and I put my head down,
and I just, I just cried.

676
00:32:00,814 --> 00:32:03,681
A couple of guys came over
and gave me hugs, you know.

677
00:32:03,750 --> 00:32:06,751
The other guys
were feeling it too,
for sure.

678
00:32:06,837 --> 00:32:08,820
I felt like we were
invincible at the time,

679
00:32:08,922 --> 00:32:10,822
and all of a sudden
you're like,

680
00:32:10,907 --> 00:32:13,007
"wow, it can happen
to us, too."

681
00:32:19,132 --> 00:32:21,599
Jocko Willink:
After Marc got killed,

682
00:32:21,651 --> 00:32:25,203
Leif, who had made
the decision

683
00:32:25,305 --> 00:32:27,238
to go back out
onto the battlefield

684
00:32:27,307 --> 00:32:29,424
after Ryan
had been wounded,

685
00:32:29,509 --> 00:32:31,276
came to me, you know,
like the next day.

686
00:32:31,378 --> 00:32:32,944
I mean, he was crushed.

687
00:32:33,013 --> 00:32:34,479
And he said,
"Hey, you know,

688
00:32:34,548 --> 00:32:39,050
I'm questioning
the decision that I made."

689
00:32:39,152 --> 00:32:40,518
I said, you know,
I said to him,

690
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:43,288
"Leif, you were out there
on the battlefield,

691
00:32:44,925 --> 00:32:48,193
and our Army brothers
were out there

692
00:32:49,796 --> 00:32:53,264
and needed our help."

693
00:32:53,366 --> 00:32:56,534
I told him
there was no decision
to make.

694
00:32:59,239 --> 00:33:03,441
You have to figure out,
like, what did we do wrong?

695
00:33:03,543 --> 00:33:06,010
And sometimes
there is no answer
for that.

696
00:33:06,112 --> 00:33:09,414
So why,
why did he get killed?

697
00:33:09,516 --> 00:33:12,750
You know,
probably could've been me.

698
00:33:12,819 --> 00:33:14,252
It could have
been anybody.

699
00:33:14,354 --> 00:33:16,087
You know,
he just was there,

700
00:33:16,189 --> 00:33:19,390
doing his job like,
like a good frogman,

701
00:33:19,459 --> 00:33:22,260
you know,
and that's it.

702
00:33:22,362 --> 00:33:25,263
I always wonder
what would've happened

703
00:33:25,365 --> 00:33:27,932
had he gone
in the door first.

704
00:33:28,001 --> 00:33:31,002
Would I have had
the courage to, you know,
do what he did?

705
00:33:31,104 --> 00:33:33,321
Put himself in harm's way
to protect his guys.

706
00:33:33,406 --> 00:33:34,439
I want to say yes,
but you never know

707
00:33:34,541 --> 00:33:36,691
until you're there.

708
00:33:36,810 --> 00:33:39,811
It's a crazy thing
to think about, for me.

709
00:33:43,617 --> 00:33:44,999
Leif Babin:
A few days later
we had a,

710
00:33:45,085 --> 00:33:48,186
we had a memorial service
on Camp Ramadi,

711
00:33:48,255 --> 00:33:50,588
and just hundreds
of people came out
of the woodwork.

712
00:33:50,690 --> 00:33:52,190
The soldiers
that we worked with,

713
00:33:52,259 --> 00:33:54,191
Marines
that we worked with.

714
00:33:54,244 --> 00:33:56,827
The loss of anyone
would've been horrific,

715
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:59,180
but for Marc in particular,
he was just such a beloved guy,
and interestingly enough,

716
00:33:59,266 --> 00:34:02,584
our Iraqi soldiers
were devastated as well.

717
00:34:02,702 --> 00:34:06,170
Uh, we stood down the troops
for a couple days,

718
00:34:06,273 --> 00:34:09,173
and then we started
planning operations

719
00:34:09,242 --> 00:34:12,410
to go out and execute.

720
00:34:12,512 --> 00:34:15,129
What I told my guys,
because I said,

721
00:34:15,215 --> 00:34:17,966
"I don't know
any other way,"

722
00:34:18,051 --> 00:34:21,469
is, "I'm gonna work.

723
00:34:23,607 --> 00:34:25,356
"I'm gonna work,
and we're gonna do

724
00:34:25,392 --> 00:34:27,976
what we came here to do."

725
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:48,580
Jason Hogan:
I actually went back
with Marc

726
00:34:48,632 --> 00:34:50,915
and went
to the service.

727
00:34:50,968 --> 00:34:54,186
The close family and friends
went and actually buried him

728
00:34:54,221 --> 00:34:57,439
and put our tridents
into his casket.

729
00:34:59,393 --> 00:35:03,728
Yeah, and put him in,
put him in the ground.

730
00:35:08,152 --> 00:35:11,736
Maya Elbaum: I thought
with Marc, there was no way
that he would ever die.

731
00:35:11,788 --> 00:35:15,106
I always thought
he was gonna be with me
for the rest of my life.

732
00:35:15,159 --> 00:35:18,326
I felt so lost.
I felt like I lost
my other...

733
00:35:18,412 --> 00:35:21,830
I lost my other half,
and I remember, you know,

734
00:35:21,915 --> 00:35:25,250
just feeling like
I was being swallowed.

735
00:35:29,756 --> 00:35:32,090
Debbie Lee: One of the things
that gives me hope,

736
00:35:32,142 --> 00:35:35,393
that young man
was redeployed to Heaven.

737
00:35:35,479 --> 00:35:37,929
I will see him
again one day.

738
00:35:43,854 --> 00:35:47,772
Marc's tombstone,
the words that are on there
are perfect.

739
00:35:47,858 --> 00:35:52,027
It says, "Deeply loved,
loved deeply."

740
00:35:52,112 --> 00:35:54,479
And that definitely
describes Marc,

741
00:35:54,581 --> 00:35:56,114
the friend that he was,

742
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:58,833
the husband that he was,
the son.

743
00:35:58,952 --> 00:36:00,818
Maya Elbaum:
He loved his family,

744
00:36:00,871 --> 00:36:03,321
his friends
and his country.

745
00:36:03,423 --> 00:36:04,873
He was the most
beautiful person

746
00:36:04,958 --> 00:36:08,376
in the whole entire world.

747
00:36:08,462 --> 00:36:10,995
Debbie Lee:
He loved very deeply,

748
00:36:11,048 --> 00:36:13,848
and because of that
he was deeply loved.

749
00:36:13,967 --> 00:36:16,301
And I think
that's one of those things

750
00:36:16,403 --> 00:36:19,137
that's reflected
in his last letter home.

751
00:36:21,225 --> 00:36:23,975
Male voice:
Glory is something
that some men chase

752
00:36:24,027 --> 00:36:26,228
and others find themselves
stumbling upon,

753
00:36:26,313 --> 00:36:28,513
not expecting it
to find them.

754
00:36:28,565 --> 00:36:30,398
Either way,
it is a noble gesture

755
00:36:30,484 --> 00:36:33,485
that one finds bestowed
upon them.

756
00:36:33,570 --> 00:36:35,904
My question is,
when does glory fade away

757
00:36:35,989 --> 00:36:39,023
and become a wrongful crusade,
or an unjustified means

758
00:36:39,126 --> 00:36:41,993
by which consumes one
completely?

759
00:36:42,045 --> 00:36:45,380
I have seen war.
I have seen death.

760
00:36:45,499 --> 00:36:47,415
The sorrow that encompasses
your entire being

761
00:36:47,501 --> 00:36:50,051
as a man
breathes his last.

762
00:36:50,137 --> 00:36:51,753
I can only pray and hope

763
00:36:51,838 --> 00:36:53,672
that none of you
will ever have to experience

764
00:36:53,757 --> 00:36:56,725
some of the things
I have seen and felt here.

765
00:36:56,843 --> 00:36:58,843
That letter has
impacted millions

766
00:36:58,929 --> 00:37:01,212
and millions of lives
around the world.

767
00:37:01,315 --> 00:37:03,515
I've gotten letters
from our troops

768
00:37:03,567 --> 00:37:05,684
who had thrown a tarp
in their garage

769
00:37:05,736 --> 00:37:07,519
and were gonna take
their own life,

770
00:37:07,571 --> 00:37:09,771
and said,
"I read Marc's letter,

771
00:37:09,856 --> 00:37:13,725
and I decided
I want to live."

772
00:37:13,827 --> 00:37:15,243
And because
of that letter,

773
00:37:15,362 --> 00:37:16,911
I founded
"America's Mighty Warriors"

774
00:37:17,030 --> 00:37:19,247
to make sure that our troops
and the families

775
00:37:19,366 --> 00:37:21,499
who have given their very best
for this nation,

776
00:37:21,535 --> 00:37:24,703
their loved one,
know that we will never
forget them.

777
00:37:27,174 --> 00:37:29,240
Tony Eafrati:
That whole effort
in Ramadi,

778
00:37:29,293 --> 00:37:31,042
people that lost
their lives there

779
00:37:31,094 --> 00:37:35,463
and got wounded and killed,
you know, I knew,

780
00:37:35,549 --> 00:37:38,082
I knew
who they were,
you know.

781
00:37:38,185 --> 00:37:39,968
I can't
get back Marc Lee.

782
00:37:40,053 --> 00:37:41,720
He's my brother,

783
00:37:41,805 --> 00:37:43,421
just like all
my other brothers

784
00:37:43,473 --> 00:37:45,089
that died in Iraq
and Afghanistan.

785
00:37:45,192 --> 00:37:47,592
But we made an impact.

786
00:37:47,644 --> 00:37:50,128
When we left
towards the end of October,

787
00:37:50,197 --> 00:37:52,631
we had COPs
all over the place now.

788
00:37:52,733 --> 00:37:55,800
So they had, they had
a really good foothold.

789
00:37:55,902 --> 00:37:58,320
We won in Ramadi,
and in a place

790
00:37:58,405 --> 00:38:01,105
that nobody thought
we could win.

791
00:38:01,208 --> 00:38:03,608
Ramadi was one
of the safest places in Iraq.

792
00:38:03,710 --> 00:38:06,661
For almost seven years
it remained that way.

793
00:38:06,747 --> 00:38:08,747
And, and we know
the formula.

794
00:38:08,832 --> 00:38:10,582
We can win again.

795
00:38:10,634 --> 00:38:13,251
Marc Lee was absolutely
one of those guys

796
00:38:13,353 --> 00:38:15,587
who knew that he could
get shot and killed
at any time,

797
00:38:15,656 --> 00:38:19,758
and he went out
and did his job
every single day,

798
00:38:19,810 --> 00:38:22,293
knowing that could happen
any time, fearlessly,

799
00:38:22,346 --> 00:38:23,595
because he knew
he was making a difference

800
00:38:23,647 --> 00:38:25,430
and believed
in what he was doing.

801
00:38:25,515 --> 00:38:29,651
I've learned that
that determination
that Marc had,

802
00:38:29,736 --> 00:38:34,439
it's something
that every SEAL has,
in their own way.

803
00:38:34,524 --> 00:38:37,809
Jason Hogan:
If you're not willing to die,
you shouldn't be there.

804
00:38:37,911 --> 00:38:41,413
I think that, that
will is either in you,
or it's not.

805
00:38:41,498 --> 00:38:44,499
I don't know
if you can develop that.

806
00:38:47,621 --> 00:38:51,790
I think it's just,
you're just born with it,
or you're not.

807
00:38:51,875 --> 00:38:56,127
I'd die in a second
for any of my bros.

808
00:38:56,179 --> 00:38:59,047
Not even think about it.

809
00:38:59,132 --> 00:39:00,882
Jocko Willink:
It's not in everybody.

810
00:39:00,967 --> 00:39:02,884
Guys like Marc
had that will,

811
00:39:02,969 --> 00:39:05,303
not only to take
the fight to the enemy

812
00:39:05,355 --> 00:39:08,172
but to make
the ultimate sacrifice.

813
00:39:08,275 --> 00:39:09,507
Nothing could
have prepared me

814
00:39:09,609 --> 00:39:11,526
for how horrific
that burden is.

815
00:39:11,645 --> 00:39:14,529
And, but, you
know, every time I stand
there at Marc's grave,

816
00:39:14,614 --> 00:39:16,314
I mean, there will never be
a time when I stand there

817
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:18,566
and don't wish
that I wouldn't be lying

818
00:39:18,652 --> 00:39:20,402
there in the ground,
and not Marc.

819
00:39:20,487 --> 00:39:23,738
Definitely...

820
00:39:23,824 --> 00:39:25,657
definitely tough to...

821
00:39:25,709 --> 00:39:27,158
a tough thing.

822
00:39:32,416 --> 00:39:35,032
Jocko Willink:
When you are lucky enough

823
00:39:35,135 --> 00:39:38,086
to experience war,

824
00:39:38,171 --> 00:39:40,422
you can get

825
00:39:40,507 --> 00:39:43,174
very jaded
because you can see

826
00:39:43,226 --> 00:39:46,594
that human beings
can be...

827
00:39:50,851 --> 00:39:53,351
abhorrent creatures.

828
00:39:53,403 --> 00:39:57,939
And you can begin
to question

829
00:39:58,024 --> 00:40:00,825
if there's really
any good at all,

830
00:40:00,861 --> 00:40:03,027
and it can become...

831
00:40:06,199 --> 00:40:10,001
dark.

832
00:40:10,036 --> 00:40:12,370
Especially
when it is your job...

833
00:40:15,709 --> 00:40:18,910
to, in some sense,

834
00:40:18,962 --> 00:40:20,879
grow that darkness.

835
00:40:20,964 --> 00:40:23,765
Marc proved

836
00:40:23,884 --> 00:40:26,267
that there was light

837
00:40:26,386 --> 00:40:27,685
and good.

838
00:40:31,224 --> 00:40:34,642
And...

839
00:40:34,728 --> 00:40:36,561
maybe...

840
00:40:36,646 --> 00:40:39,898
it was hard to see that

841
00:40:39,950 --> 00:40:43,318
in his life,

842
00:40:43,403 --> 00:40:48,156
but for some
unknown reason,

843
00:40:48,241 --> 00:40:51,125
or reason
that's beyond
understanding,

844
00:40:53,463 --> 00:40:57,048
I saw it
in his death.

845
00:41:01,471 --> 00:41:03,338
Man's voice:
To all my family
and friends,

846
00:41:03,423 --> 00:41:06,825
do me a favor
pass on the kindness,
the love,

847
00:41:06,927 --> 00:41:09,093
the precious gift
of human life to each other.

848
00:41:09,196 --> 00:41:10,979
So that when your children
come into contact

849
00:41:11,097 --> 00:41:12,647
with a great conflict,

850
00:41:12,766 --> 00:41:15,350
like the one we are faced
with here in Iraq,

851
00:41:15,435 --> 00:41:17,352
that they will be people
of humanity,

852
00:41:17,437 --> 00:41:20,371
people of pure motives
and of compassion.

853
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:23,324
This is our real part
to keep America free.

854
00:41:23,410 --> 00:41:26,644
Happy Fourth.
Love you, Marc Lee.

855
00:41:31,117 --> 00:41:34,035
Man:
If I was a bomber, living
anywhere around here,

856
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:36,788
this is exactly where
I'd place a device.

857
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:38,623
They were prepared
and waiting for us.

858
00:41:38,708 --> 00:41:40,491
And they ambushed us.

859
00:41:40,544 --> 00:41:42,293
We lost radio contact,

860
00:41:42,379 --> 00:41:45,179
immediately I hear
all this gunfire.

861
00:41:45,298 --> 00:41:49,183
We had men down
and we have to get up there
to help.

862
00:41:49,302 --> 00:41:51,386
Man #1:
I'm a warrior.

863
00:41:51,471 --> 00:41:54,889
I'm here to make sure
that all my brothers
come back alive.

864
00:41:54,975 --> 00:41:56,474
I wasn't gonna
let them die.

.......high school musical....
1
00:00:04,004 --> 00:00:05,422
And all for one.

2
00:00:05,506 --> 00:00:08,258
RICKY: Previously on High School
Musical: The Musical: The Series...

3
00:00:08,342 --> 00:00:11,386
Contrary to rumor, we are not
doing High School Musical Two.

4
00:00:12,721 --> 00:00:18,435
Course by course one by one.

5
00:00:18,519 --> 00:00:20,646
- Did you see me performing up there?
- I did, yes.

6
00:00:20,729 --> 00:00:22,439
Howie was being
super weird just now,

7
00:00:22,523 --> 00:00:24,900
and I'm dangerously close to
doubting myself here, Neen.

8
00:00:24,983 --> 00:00:27,486
We don't do it for them.
Okay? We do it for us.

9
00:00:27,569 --> 00:00:30,781
I just came by to support my
favorite actor at East High.

10
00:00:30,864 --> 00:00:32,115
Be our guest!

11
00:00:32,199 --> 00:00:34,052
- It's official. My mom's not coming.
- Oh, I...

12
00:00:34,076 --> 00:00:35,619
She sent me a surprise instead.

13
00:00:35,702 --> 00:00:37,955
- I think she meant me.
- Jamie?

14
00:00:39,373 --> 00:00:40,791
I'm sorry, who is this?

15
00:00:42,918 --> 00:00:44,044
Is he with us?

16
00:00:44,503 --> 00:00:45,712
He got a little freaked out.

17
00:00:45,796 --> 00:00:48,340
You're like a legit
music producer.

18
00:00:48,423 --> 00:00:51,468
- You know Mom always says...
- BOTH: "Just keep pushing."

19
00:00:51,552 --> 00:00:55,973
Look, we're all just really glad that
Gigi has a big-brother figure in her life.

20
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:57,057
My harness is missing.

21
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:58,767
No, this can't be happening.

22
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:18,996
Oh, my God, y'all.
Ricky's transformation.

23
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:20,122
Wait. How'd it look?

24
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:22,291
Honestly?

25
00:01:23,125 --> 00:01:24,167
Passable!

26
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:25,711
NINI: Oh, yeah.

27
00:01:25,794 --> 00:01:27,754
GIRL: That's amazing!
That's awesome.

28
00:01:27,838 --> 00:01:30,716
Hey! Give it up for our star.

29
00:01:36,221 --> 00:01:37,806
Uh, has anyone
seen my boyfriend?

30
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:40,267
It feels like I've been
missing him all night.

31
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:42,144
I think he pushed
himself a little hard.

32
00:01:42,227 --> 00:01:44,313
But I'm pretty sure he left
a letter at your locker.

33
00:01:44,396 --> 00:01:46,899
Uh, couple letters, actually.

34
00:01:47,691 --> 00:01:50,068
Oh, okay, wow, that's sweet.

35
00:01:50,152 --> 00:01:52,738
Um, maybe I'll read them
on the way to Slices.

36
00:01:53,822 --> 00:01:55,157
Good show, everyone.

37
00:02:09,171 --> 00:02:10,172
Biggie?

38
00:02:14,927 --> 00:02:17,930
I've always seen
your name in lights.

39
00:02:19,389 --> 00:02:22,601
This is what you were doing
in between scenes all night?

40
00:02:23,101 --> 00:02:27,397
Yeah. No. Sometimes I
was actually puking.

41
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:31,735
You were the perfect
Belle tonight.

42
00:02:32,528 --> 00:02:34,238
- I was really proud.
-

43
00:02:36,573 --> 00:02:38,867
Come here, you evil genius.

44
00:02:40,077 --> 00:02:41,870
- Okay. Wait...
-

45
00:02:45,874 --> 00:02:47,668
Oh, wait. I just got paint...

46
00:02:47,751 --> 00:02:48,752
It's okay.

47
00:02:52,714 --> 00:02:53,841
Hey, Kourtney.

48
00:02:55,717 --> 00:02:56,927
Congrats.

49
00:02:58,512 --> 00:03:01,139
Thank you, Howard.

50
00:03:02,558 --> 00:03:03,600
You're welcome.

51
00:03:06,645 --> 00:03:07,980
Um...

52
00:03:08,063 --> 00:03:10,858
Okay, can I just say
something real quick?

53
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:14,903
If I don't measure up in some way tonight,
then I would like to know that now,

54
00:03:14,987 --> 00:03:17,364
because after the big North
High secret identity thing,

55
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:20,284
I'm not here for any more
secrets or surprises.

56
00:03:20,367 --> 00:03:22,202
Kourtney, that's
not what this is.

57
00:03:24,246 --> 00:03:25,247
Uh...

58
00:03:29,001 --> 00:03:30,335
I'm blown away.

59
00:03:31,795 --> 00:03:33,964
That's what's going on. Uh...

60
00:03:35,132 --> 00:03:38,552
I couldn't take my
eyes off you tonight.

61
00:03:39,386 --> 00:03:40,637
Um...

62
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:44,308
I'm sorry. This is, like

63
00:03:45,434 --> 00:03:46,560
a new feeling for me.

64
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:48,228
Are you feeling intimidated?

65
00:03:48,312 --> 00:03:50,606
You know, we don't have
to use any more words.

66
00:03:50,689 --> 00:03:52,608
No, I think I'd like
to hear you say this.

67
00:03:53,734 --> 00:03:55,068
Do you need a drum roll?

68
00:03:55,736 --> 00:03:57,487
Uh...

69
00:04:00,782 --> 00:04:02,075
You make me nervous...

70
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:04,661
In a good way.

71
00:04:04,745 --> 00:04:09,958
And that's a good thing and I
just want that good thing to

72
00:04:11,543 --> 00:04:12,753
to keep going.

73
00:04:15,464 --> 00:04:17,758
And I didn't really
know how to say it.

74
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:22,429
Happy now?

75
00:04:22,513 --> 00:04:23,597
MICHELLE: Yes.

76
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:27,392
- Sorry. Sorry.
-

77
00:04:28,477 --> 00:04:29,478
Um...

78
00:04:29,895 --> 00:04:31,230
You in the mood for pizza?

79
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:34,441
If it's with you, always.

80
00:04:35,943 --> 00:04:36,944
MICHELLE: Wait. Wait.

81
00:04:37,611 --> 00:04:39,029
Here.

82
00:04:39,613 --> 00:04:41,573
- I'm not even here right now.
-

83
00:04:42,574 --> 00:04:44,826
Oh, my God.

84
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:58,382
MAZZARA: Caswell.

85
00:04:59,216 --> 00:05:00,217
Ah!

86
00:05:02,803 --> 00:05:05,180
I feel I should thank you.

87
00:05:05,848 --> 00:05:06,849
For?

88
00:05:07,391 --> 00:05:08,976
I got a call during the show.

89
00:05:09,601 --> 00:05:14,147
It seems I've been recommended for a spot
in the Caltech doctoral robotics program.

90
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:16,733
That's amazing. Congrats!

91
00:05:16,817 --> 00:05:19,403
They mentioned that
their financial adviser,

92
00:05:19,486 --> 00:05:22,072
Cash Caswell, spoke
very highly of me.

93
00:05:22,698 --> 00:05:24,908
They weren't supposed
to say that part.

94
00:05:26,618 --> 00:05:27,995
It's quite generous, son.

95
00:05:29,121 --> 00:05:31,623
That's not being generous,
it's doing what you can.

96
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:36,253
So, what are you gonna do?

97
00:05:37,546 --> 00:05:38,547
I...

98
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:40,591
MISS JENN: Thank you.

99
00:05:42,009 --> 00:05:43,552
I really don't know.

100
00:05:43,635 --> 00:05:44,636
Yo, Gaston!

101
00:05:50,726 --> 00:05:54,313
Just want you to know, I just
looked up squid ink risotto online,

102
00:05:54,396 --> 00:05:56,607
and I have a few questions.

103
00:05:56,690 --> 00:06:01,028
Actually, I have questions about a
lot of stuff that went down tonight.

104
00:06:01,111 --> 00:06:03,780
So, I am ready to
head out when you are.

105
00:06:03,864 --> 00:06:08,076
I was actually thinking we should
just maybe go to Slices tonight.

106
00:06:08,994 --> 00:06:10,829
Oh. Yeah?

107
00:06:10,913 --> 00:06:13,582
Yeah. I mean, it's Ashlyn's
big night and everything,

108
00:06:13,665 --> 00:06:16,501
and it seems like we should
stick with the gang tonight.

109
00:06:16,585 --> 00:06:19,713
Oh, man. Does this mean we
gotta reschedule one more time?

110
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:23,425
We could or we could just
play it by ear, you know?

111
00:06:26,637 --> 00:06:28,347
Cool. Okay.

112
00:06:29,014 --> 00:06:31,141
It would have been fun.
I just feel like...

113
00:06:31,225 --> 00:06:34,144
No, yeah, this is perfect.
I'm just gonna grab my...

114
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:36,271
I'll see you there, then.

115
00:06:51,453 --> 00:06:53,038
NINI: Hey! There you are.

116
00:06:54,331 --> 00:06:56,083
Oh, I was just gonna text you.

117
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:58,919
Gotta catch up with Big Red
before he heads to Slices.

118
00:06:59,002 --> 00:07:02,464
Oh, well, I just wanted give you
this. Finally signed my name.

119
00:07:02,548 --> 00:07:03,924
- Here's mine.
-

120
00:07:05,884 --> 00:07:08,053
- Should we just read 'em now?
- Why not?

121
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:09,137
Okay.

122
00:07:09,221 --> 00:07:10,764
Um...

123
00:07:11,306 --> 00:07:12,641
- "Dear Ricky."
- "Dear Nini."

124
00:07:12,724 --> 00:07:14,059
- Oh, come on.
-

125
00:07:14,142 --> 00:07:16,645
- Did we seriously write the same thing?
-

126
00:07:17,646 --> 00:07:20,065
Um, "I know it's been
quite a journey."

127
00:07:20,148 --> 00:07:21,608
- You said "long semester."
- 'Kay.

128
00:07:22,317 --> 00:07:24,862
"But I'm so glad to
be where we are."

129
00:07:24,945 --> 00:07:28,824
"But I wouldn't trade it for
anything. Here's to second acts."

130
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:32,160
"And new beginnings.
Love, Nini."

131
00:07:37,249 --> 00:07:38,250
It's pretty crazy.

132
00:07:38,792 --> 00:07:41,086
I guess we are literally
on the same page.

133
00:07:43,338 --> 00:07:44,339
Just for a moment.

134
00:08:00,814 --> 00:08:02,733
Miss Jenn? You're
emoting by yourself.

135
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:04,234
It's not over.

136
00:08:05,527 --> 00:08:06,695
It's not over yet.

137
00:08:08,405 --> 00:08:13,202
Twenty-five percent of our final Menkies
score will occur at the actual ceremony,

138
00:08:14,828 --> 00:08:17,623
when I perform
opposite Zackey Roy.

139
00:08:19,708 --> 00:08:21,210
You mean when we do.

140
00:08:21,293 --> 00:08:23,754
Maybe if we have a perfect
performance at the Menkies,

141
00:08:24,546 --> 00:08:25,923
we'll still win something.

142
00:08:29,718 --> 00:08:31,720
- Did you need something?
- CARLOS: Um...

143
00:08:32,262 --> 00:08:36,016
I was gonna ask you to sign my program,
but that's a hard never mind now.

144
00:08:36,725 --> 00:08:38,018
Are you coming to the party?

145
00:08:38,101 --> 00:08:42,189
Oh, I would. But I have to
study the video of tonight.

146
00:08:42,606 --> 00:08:44,733
There's room for improvement
before the awards.

147
00:08:46,026 --> 00:08:47,277
But have fun, you two.

148
00:08:48,612 --> 00:08:49,905
We'll always have

149
00:08:51,156 --> 00:08:52,157
fun.

150
00:09:14,012 --> 00:09:16,807
Gina, hey. Comin' to Slices?

151
00:09:17,391 --> 00:09:19,518
Uh, think I'm gonna head
home early, actually.

152
00:09:20,936 --> 00:09:21,937
Hey.

153
00:09:25,148 --> 00:09:26,149
What's goin' on?

154
00:09:30,195 --> 00:09:35,701
I just had this big dumb plan to go out
with EJ tonight and he just cancelled.

155
00:09:36,618 --> 00:09:37,786
Oh...

156
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:39,079
You can go tomorrow.

157
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:42,374
No, he cancelled, Nini.

158
00:09:44,042 --> 00:09:45,043
For good.

159
00:09:50,007 --> 00:09:53,177
Gina, I don't know what's
going on between you and EJ,

160
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:55,012
- but you are a force of nature.
- Nini...

161
00:09:55,095 --> 00:09:56,805
You have this energy
about you that's...

162
00:09:56,889 --> 00:09:57,890
Off-putting?

163
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:59,641
Powerful.

164
00:10:02,311 --> 00:10:04,271
I'd say any guy would
be lucky to have you,

165
00:10:04,354 --> 00:10:05,606
but that's not the point.

166
00:10:06,523 --> 00:10:08,525
Truth is, we're all
lucky to know you.

167
00:10:11,612 --> 00:10:12,863
You're still doin' it.

168
00:10:14,364 --> 00:10:15,365
Doing what?

169
00:10:16,408 --> 00:10:18,118
Lifting other people up.

170
00:10:19,161 --> 00:10:21,246
- You did it all night.
-

171
00:10:24,499 --> 00:10:28,879
Look, I'm really sorry about the whole
Valentine's Day chocolates thing.

172
00:10:32,049 --> 00:10:35,427
Honestly, it was more about me and
you than it was about me and him.

173
00:10:36,136 --> 00:10:38,472
- Wait, who and who?
-

174
00:10:38,555 --> 00:10:42,142
I was just hoping we were finally
in a place where you could...

175
00:10:46,772 --> 00:10:48,148
I did. I do.

176
00:10:49,525 --> 00:10:52,277
I mean, that's something
that I learned early on,

177
00:10:53,362 --> 00:10:56,156
when you stole all my
stuff, then gave it back.

178
00:11:02,538 --> 00:11:04,498
You're a really
solid person, Nini.

179
00:11:09,211 --> 00:11:10,212
Well...

180
00:11:10,671 --> 00:11:12,840
If you change your mind
about going to Slices...

181
00:11:15,592 --> 00:11:18,303
Our show would have
been better, by the way,

182
00:11:20,138 --> 00:11:22,182
if you could have sung
The Rose Song tonight.

183
00:11:25,185 --> 00:11:26,270
I don't know about that.

184
00:11:26,353 --> 00:11:29,606
Have you thought about taking your
songwriting to the next level?

185
00:11:31,817 --> 00:11:32,985
What are you asking me?

186
00:11:35,696 --> 00:11:37,739
There's someone I
think you should meet.

187
00:11:48,876 --> 00:11:50,669
- Oh, good.
- Hmm?

188
00:11:50,752 --> 00:11:52,838
I wasn't sure if you'd
be at the pizza place.

189
00:11:52,921 --> 00:11:54,548
I'm waiting for
the Menkies judge.

190
00:11:54,631 --> 00:11:56,175
He is going to
deliver the verdict

191
00:11:56,258 --> 00:11:59,178
and let me know what we got
nominated for, or didn't.

192
00:12:00,095 --> 00:12:02,222
I'm in a great place mentally.

193
00:12:02,806 --> 00:12:03,849
I believe you.

194
00:12:05,893 --> 00:12:08,312
I told you to jump off
something high, Ricky.

195
00:12:08,854 --> 00:12:11,315
Yeah, I landed on my feet. So...

196
00:12:11,857 --> 00:12:12,858
You always do.

197
00:12:14,067 --> 00:12:15,068
But, uh...

198
00:12:16,195 --> 00:12:20,115
I'm not sure that I didn't push
you kids too hard this semester.

199
00:12:24,369 --> 00:12:25,579
Um...

200
00:12:25,662 --> 00:12:28,624
I saw you with my dad before
the show. All the giggling.

201
00:12:28,707 --> 00:12:30,083
I do that when I'm nervous.

202
00:12:30,167 --> 00:12:31,376
I was talking about him.

203
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:34,296
Uh, my dad... Um...

204
00:12:35,088 --> 00:12:38,175
He's been through a lot this
year, and I'm sure you have, too.

205
00:12:38,842 --> 00:12:40,260
And I'm starting to realize,

206
00:12:41,136 --> 00:12:45,849
no one should be able to tell anyone
who they can or can't take a chance on.

207
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:48,560
Where is this going?

208
00:12:50,812 --> 00:12:54,358
You have my blessing, if
you want to date him again.

209
00:12:54,441 --> 00:12:57,486
I mean, he's a crank and he
can't make chicken, but...

210
00:12:57,569 --> 00:12:59,738
And you make him happy.

211
00:13:01,365 --> 00:13:02,366
What else is there?

212
00:13:03,408 --> 00:13:04,618
Are you happy?

213
00:13:05,619 --> 00:13:07,704
Uh...

214
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:15,379
You know, I, uh, walked into the first
day of school this year a skate rat.

215
00:13:15,462 --> 00:13:20,342
And now, after two opening nights,
I'm not really sure what I am.

216
00:13:22,261 --> 00:13:23,262
But...

217
00:13:23,345 --> 00:13:27,349
But yeah, I think I'm
happy, or gettin' there.

218
00:13:29,268 --> 00:13:31,144
Well, you deserve to be.

219
00:13:31,937 --> 00:13:32,938
So do you.

220
00:13:33,981 --> 00:13:36,483
RICKY: All right.

221
00:13:39,194 --> 00:13:41,029
Here's to second chances, huh?

222
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:46,785
- See you at Slices?
- Yeah.

223
00:13:55,794 --> 00:13:58,589
Who knew that love
could be so bittersweet?

224
00:13:58,672 --> 00:14:01,925
Oh, when it finally
meets the end?

225
00:14:03,385 --> 00:14:05,971
But there is something
in the summer wind.

226
00:14:06,054 --> 00:14:09,224
A moment to begin again.

227
00:14:10,642 --> 00:14:13,353
I know that every
time a door is shut.

228
00:14:13,437 --> 00:14:16,690
A window opens up for me.

229
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:20,694
It's all wide open
down this road I'm on

230
00:14:20,777 --> 00:14:23,614
I'm finding who I want to be.

231
00:14:23,697 --> 00:14:27,618
BOTH: I got a
second chance to fly

232
00:14:27,701 --> 00:14:31,330
I got a second chance to fall.

233
00:14:31,413 --> 00:14:33,415
What can make the tide turn?

234
00:14:33,498 --> 00:14:35,334
What can make the fire burn?

235
00:14:35,417 --> 00:14:38,337
A second chance is all.

236
00:14:39,796 --> 00:14:42,841
Was I a fool to read
between the lines?

237
00:14:42,925 --> 00:14:46,136
Did I misread the
signs that much?

238
00:14:47,262 --> 00:14:50,307
Who would have thought we'd
come this far as friends?

239
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:53,602
Maybe that should've
been enough.

240
00:14:54,686 --> 00:14:57,606
Maybe I'm safer
when I'm on the run.

241
00:14:57,689 --> 00:15:00,984
No time to open up my heart.

242
00:15:02,027 --> 00:15:05,030
Maybe I'll hide
behind my walls again.

243
00:15:05,113 --> 00:15:08,283
Instead of tearing them apart.

244
00:15:08,367 --> 00:15:11,245
BOTH: I got a
second chance to fly

245
00:15:11,328 --> 00:15:15,249
I got a second chance to fall.

246
00:15:15,874 --> 00:15:17,709
What can make the tide turn?

247
00:15:17,793 --> 00:15:19,878
What can make the fire burn?

248
00:15:19,962 --> 00:15:22,673
A second chance is all

249
00:15:22,756 --> 00:15:26,260
- I'm finding who I wanna be.
- Begin again

250
00:15:26,343 --> 00:15:28,428
I thought I knew what I wanted

251
00:15:28,512 --> 00:15:31,181
I'm safer when I'm on the run

252
00:15:31,265 --> 00:15:34,226
- I'm finding who I wanna be.
- RICKY: Begin again.

253
00:15:34,309 --> 00:15:35,727
EJ: I thought I
knew what I want.

254
00:15:35,811 --> 00:15:37,980
GINA: I'm safer
when I'm on the run

255
00:15:38,063 --> 00:15:41,108
I got a second chance to fly.

256
00:15:41,608 --> 00:15:44,903
I got a second chance to fall.

257
00:15:45,529 --> 00:15:47,447
What can make the tide turn?

258
00:15:47,531 --> 00:15:49,366
What can make the fire burn?

259
00:15:49,449 --> 00:15:52,536
A second chance is all

260
00:15:52,619 --> 00:15:56,081
I got a second chance to fly

261
00:15:56,164 --> 00:15:59,543
I got a second chance to fall

262
00:15:59,626 --> 00:16:02,087
- I wonder...
- ALL: What can make the tide turn?

263
00:16:02,171 --> 00:16:04,214
What can make the fire burn?

264
00:16:04,298 --> 00:16:07,009
A second chance is all

265
00:16:07,092 --> 00:16:11,013
- I'm finding who I wanna be.
- Begin again

266
00:16:11,096 --> 00:16:12,936
- I thought I knew what I wanted.
- Begin again

267
00:16:13,015 --> 00:16:14,892
I'm safer when I'm on the run

268
00:16:14,975 --> 00:16:18,770
- I'm finding who I wanna be.
- Begin again.

269
00:16:18,854 --> 00:16:21,940
A second chance is all.

270
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:34,328
Tonight was one for
the record books.

271
00:16:34,411 --> 00:16:35,412
ALL: Yes!

272
00:16:36,955 --> 00:16:39,458
I literally don't even
remember being on stage.

273
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:42,085
The rest of us will
never forget it.

274
00:16:42,169 --> 00:16:43,795
- CARLOS: Oh, thank you.
-

275
00:16:49,218 --> 00:16:52,346
We just came to
congratulate you all.

276
00:16:52,429 --> 00:16:56,892
It is true. Your show had a beginning,
a middle, and an end. It was wonderful.

277
00:16:59,228 --> 00:17:01,980
And Big Red, you
were also in it.

278
00:17:05,234 --> 00:17:07,528
Okay, well, thank you
guys for dropping by,

279
00:17:07,611 --> 00:17:10,572
but this is kind of a private
party. So if you could, uh...

280
00:17:10,656 --> 00:17:11,990
ALL: Bye. GINA: Thank you.

281
00:17:12,074 --> 00:17:15,702
- ALL: We'll miss you.
- Out you go. I said it. Come on.

282
00:17:17,246 --> 00:17:18,914
In case we never speak again...

283
00:17:20,082 --> 00:17:21,458
I like you, Ricky.

284
00:17:22,417 --> 00:17:27,047
I like your big, brown eyes
and your big, round hair.

285
00:17:28,006 --> 00:17:30,759
- Lily, look...
- Okay, I'm just saying.

286
00:17:32,135 --> 00:17:34,596
Sometimes people
deserve a second chance.

287
00:17:38,475 --> 00:17:39,518
After you.

288
00:17:45,065 --> 00:17:47,109
- NATALIE: The audacity.
-

289
00:17:47,192 --> 00:17:48,235
Can you guys imagine

290
00:17:48,318 --> 00:17:50,529
- if they actually win at the Menkies?
-

291
00:17:50,612 --> 00:17:52,739
Honestly, and don't sue me,

292
00:17:52,823 --> 00:17:56,285
but I kind of don't care anymore if
we win or lose to the competition.

293
00:17:56,994 --> 00:17:59,371
I actually feel the same.

294
00:17:59,454 --> 00:18:00,914
Okay, I thought it was just me.

295
00:18:00,998 --> 00:18:04,459
I mean, we did it, right? We
already got everything we wanted.

296
00:18:05,627 --> 00:18:11,425
But just let the whole competition
go, after all this work?

297
00:18:14,469 --> 00:18:17,639
If I can have a, uh,
senior moment here.

298
00:18:21,101 --> 00:18:24,730
I've won a bunch of trophies
over the years, you guys.

299
00:18:26,523 --> 00:18:29,318
But I'd trade it all for this
group right here tonight.

300
00:18:29,401 --> 00:18:31,028
- ASHLYN: Aw!
-

301
00:18:31,111 --> 00:18:32,589
SEB: That's nice.
CARLOS: Love you guys.

302
00:18:32,613 --> 00:18:33,840
KOURTNEY: I love you. EJ: Yeah.

303
00:18:33,864 --> 00:18:36,408
So, what are we
gonna tell Miss Jenn?

304
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:42,581
The envelope, please.

305
00:18:43,123 --> 00:18:47,211
Wildcats, I have in my
hands the nominations

306
00:18:47,294 --> 00:18:51,131
for the Alan Menken Awards for Excellence
in High School Musical Theater.

307
00:18:52,174 --> 00:18:53,550
I haven't opened it yet,

308
00:18:54,343 --> 00:18:57,888
but who's ready for the
biggest moment of the year?

309
00:19:04,102 --> 00:19:05,103
Am I muted?

310
00:19:05,979 --> 00:19:09,441
We were kinda thinking,

311
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:12,736
you know, maybe we won already.

312
00:19:13,403 --> 00:19:14,530
NINI: Yeah.

313
00:19:14,613 --> 00:19:19,785
Maybe we don't need or want
to see what's in the envelope?

314
00:19:23,247 --> 00:19:24,248
Oh, thank God.

315
00:19:24,331 --> 00:19:27,209
I had to stop four times on the way
here because I was physically ill.

316
00:19:29,127 --> 00:19:31,839
- It was five.
- Hey. I get it.

317
00:19:31,922 --> 00:19:34,424
ASHLYN: It's true.

318
00:19:35,217 --> 00:19:36,593
MISS JENN: So, it's settled.

319
00:19:37,678 --> 00:19:39,596
We're dropping out
of the competition.

320
00:19:40,806 --> 00:19:41,807
NINI: Yeah.

321
00:19:47,938 --> 00:19:49,690
But what am I
gonna do with this?

322
00:19:53,735 --> 00:19:55,988
Oh, give me that.
We got a pizza oven.

323
00:19:56,071 --> 00:19:57,865
Yes!

324
00:20:03,537 --> 00:20:08,333
So are you really going to leave these
magical kids for a college somewhere?

325
00:20:09,543 --> 00:20:12,504
The only thing keeping me from
running to California is...

326
00:20:12,588 --> 00:20:13,589
Earthquakes.

327
00:20:14,047 --> 00:20:16,758
You, us, or

328
00:20:17,718 --> 00:20:19,178
the possibility of us.

329
00:20:21,263 --> 00:20:23,974
Unless, uh, you
have a better offer.

330
00:20:27,144 --> 00:20:29,730
My brother's expecting
your call tonight.

331
00:20:30,355 --> 00:20:31,398
Oh...

332
00:20:32,566 --> 00:20:33,775
Why am I nervous?

333
00:20:33,859 --> 00:20:36,069
Because it might
change your life.

334
00:20:36,153 --> 00:20:39,698
- Oh, great.
-

335
00:20:41,241 --> 00:20:42,242
Hey, roomie.

336
00:20:43,327 --> 00:20:47,623
Listen, uh, I just had a chance to
talk to EJ before he snuck out and...

337
00:20:48,916 --> 00:20:50,209
I am so sorry.

338
00:20:50,292 --> 00:20:53,295
If I had known you thought
of him as a big brother,

339
00:20:53,378 --> 00:20:57,841
I would've given you some very
different advice this semester.

340
00:20:57,925 --> 00:20:58,926
Okay.

341
00:20:59,551 --> 00:21:00,552
Wait, what?

342
00:21:00,636 --> 00:21:01,637
What?

343
00:21:02,179 --> 00:21:05,182
Wait. Why would EJ think that?

344
00:21:07,309 --> 00:21:08,477
Ashlyn?

345
00:21:13,941 --> 00:21:15,943
Hey, Jamie, it's Nini.

346
00:21:16,944 --> 00:21:21,907
Hey, Lily. It's,
uh, it's me, Ricky.

347
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:24,451
EJ!

348
00:21:28,372 --> 00:21:29,998
You got bad intel.

349
00:21:30,832 --> 00:21:31,833
What?

350
00:21:32,709 --> 00:21:33,710
Can I...

351
00:21:35,337 --> 00:21:36,505
Can you what?

352
00:21:36,964 --> 00:21:38,131
Can I kiss you?

353
00:21:41,009 --> 00:21:43,011
Will you be my first kiss?

354
00:21:55,065 --> 00:21:58,694
Buckle up, Wildcats. This
summer's about to get hot.

355
00:21:58,777 --> 00:22:01,113
Yes. Yes, it is.

356
00:22:12,207 --> 00:22:13,542
DIRECTOR: Cut.

357
00:22:13,625 --> 00:22:15,377
Listen, I'm sure Seb and Gina...

358
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:17,629
- Don't you laugh at me.
- SOFIA: I'm not laughing.

359
00:22:19,965 --> 00:22:22,634
Listen, I'm sure... Oh,
my God, I'm so sorry.

360
00:22:22,718 --> 00:22:23,927
- Listen...
-

361
00:22:24,011 --> 00:22:26,680
-

362
00:22:26,763 --> 00:22:29,474
Excuse me, have you seen a
Duke sweatshirt anywhere?

363
00:22:29,558 --> 00:22:31,685
Oh, my God! What are you
doing at the airport?

364
00:22:31,768 --> 00:22:33,937
- Uh... Oh, no!
-

365
00:22:34,021 --> 00:22:35,022
Do I... Ooh!

366
00:22:38,275 --> 00:22:39,377
- Ow!
- KEEGAN: Don't scream.

367
00:22:39,401 --> 00:22:42,738
KEEGAN: I'm so
sorry. I cut you off.

368
00:22:42,821 --> 00:22:45,699
We're gonna workshop
our Be Our Guest...

369
00:22:45,782 --> 00:22:47,284
- I turned British.
-

370
00:22:47,367 --> 00:22:50,329
We're gonna workshop our Be
Our Guest ideas on you guys...

371
00:22:51,121 --> 00:22:53,540
We're gonna workshop our
Be Our Guest audition...

372
00:22:54,708 --> 00:22:58,504
We're gonna workshop our Be
Our Guest visions on you guys.

373
00:22:58,587 --> 00:23:01,215
We're gonna workshop our Be I...

374
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:02,883
Oh, my gosh!

375
00:23:02,966 --> 00:23:05,844
Improv is all about
graciously handing the...

376
00:23:05,928 --> 00:23:07,846
Sorry.

377
00:23:08,222 --> 00:23:11,350
MATT: I've won a bunch of
trophies over the years, you guys.

378
00:23:12,643 --> 00:23:15,229
But I'd trade it all for
this group right here.

379
00:23:16,855 --> 00:23:20,067
And actually, I think I can
speak for all of us in saying

380
00:23:21,485 --> 00:23:25,239
that this whole situation is kind
of a dream come true for all of us.

381
00:23:25,322 --> 00:23:26,382
JULIA LESTER: Mmm-hmm, yes.

382
00:23:26,406 --> 00:23:30,744
And I think it's only fitting if we
all have one more group exercise.

383
00:23:30,827 --> 00:23:31,987
OLIVIA RODRIGO: Mmm-hmm, yes.

384
00:23:37,042 --> 00:23:38,168
Yeah.

385
00:23:39,670 --> 00:23:42,506
You are the music in me.

386
00:23:43,382 --> 00:23:44,591
Sing it, dude.

387
00:23:44,675 --> 00:23:48,011
You know the words
"Once upon a time".

388
00:23:48,095 --> 00:23:52,683
Make you listen,
there's a reason.

389
00:23:54,268 --> 00:23:57,813
When you dream There's
a chance you'll find.

390
00:23:57,896 --> 00:24:03,235
A little laughter,
or happy ever after.

391
00:24:03,318 --> 00:24:07,865
You're a harmony to the melody.

392
00:24:07,948 --> 00:24:11,618
Echoing inside my head.

393
00:24:11,702 --> 00:24:17,124
- A single voice, above the noise.
- Single voice.

394
00:24:17,207 --> 00:24:20,002
Like a common thread.

395
00:24:20,085 --> 00:24:22,421
Mmm, you're pulling me.

396
00:24:22,838 --> 00:24:25,215
ALL: When I hear
my favorite song

397
00:24:25,299 --> 00:24:27,968
I know that we belong.

398
00:24:28,051 --> 00:24:31,180
Oh, you are the music in me.

399
00:24:31,805 --> 00:24:34,516
It's living in all of us.

400
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:37,728
It's brought us here because.

401
00:24:37,811 --> 00:24:40,564
Because you are the music in me.

402
00:24:44,568 --> 00:24:45,944
Yeah.

403
00:24:46,695 --> 00:24:49,698
You are the music in me.

404
00:24:53,535 --> 00:24:55,037
Yeah.

405
00:24:55,662 --> 00:24:59,291
You are the music in me.

406
00:25:13,388 --> 00:25:14,932
MARK ST. CYR: It's okay.

407
00:25:15,015 --> 00:25:16,225
JOSHUA BASSETT: What team?

408
00:25:16,308 --> 00:25:17,559

JOSHUA: Yeah! ALL: Wildcats!

OLIVIA: Too late,

413
00:25:31,907 --> 00:25:34,910
Are y'all still recordin'?
This thing recordin'?

414
00:25:34,993 --> 00:25:36,203
Boom.

......sex and the city.....
1
00:00:47,714 --> 00:00:49,841
It happened two days ago.

2
00:00:50,016 --> 00:00:54,350
Aidan and I had been seeing each other
for three weeks when...

3
00:00:55,522 --> 00:01:00,118
- What is it? Bad dream?
- I'm not sure.

4
00:01:01,861 --> 00:01:05,729
- What's wrong?
- I don't know.

5
00:01:07,267 --> 00:01:09,326
The truth was I really didn't.

6
00:01:11,104 --> 00:01:13,732
The next day
I searched for unpaid bills,

7
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:16,205
unanswered calls, unmet deadlines.

8
00:01:16,376 --> 00:01:19,812
But I hadn't so much as missed
a teeth cleaning.

9
00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:22,914
My life appeared to be in order.

10
00:01:23,783 --> 00:01:26,343
But the next night, like clockwork...

11
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:33,089
I realized I was in an existential crisis.

12
00:01:33,226 --> 00:01:36,923
One that not even the sight of this
season's Dolce & Gabbana sandals

13
00:01:37,063 --> 00:01:38,758
could lift me out of.

14
00:01:46,272 --> 00:01:48,740
Do you wanna spend the night?

15
00:01:49,876 --> 00:01:53,710
- I'm gonna get some water.
- Relax. I'll get it.

16
00:02:04,858 --> 00:02:06,587
Then I realized it.

17
00:02:06,726 --> 00:02:09,991
What was wrong was,
for the first time in my life,

18
00:02:10,196 --> 00:02:14,792
I was in a relationship
where absolutely nothing was wrong.

19
00:02:18,771 --> 00:02:20,329
It's smooth sailing.

20
00:02:20,507 --> 00:02:22,975
Nothing but calm seas, blue horizons.

21
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:25,270
See what I'm saying?

22
00:02:25,445 --> 00:02:27,470
Absolutely. Not a cloud in sight.

23
00:02:27,647 --> 00:02:29,274
We adore each other.

24
00:02:29,449 --> 00:02:31,246
We have fun. We mesh.

25
00:02:31,417 --> 00:02:33,817
And this is a problem?

26
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:39,619
It feels odd.
I'm used to the hunt.

27
00:02:39,792 --> 00:02:44,786
This is... effortless.
It's freaking me out.

28
00:02:44,964 --> 00:02:48,400
I totally understand.
You're not getting the stomach flip.

29
00:02:48,568 --> 00:02:51,002
Which is just a fear of losing the guy.

30
00:02:51,204 --> 00:02:53,229
Maybe I'm not used to
being with someone

31
00:02:53,406 --> 00:02:56,705
who doesn't do the seductive
withholding dance.

32
00:02:56,876 --> 00:03:01,575
But there is an upside to being
with a guy with no surprises.

33
00:03:01,748 --> 00:03:05,377
Steve is completely predictable,
but that's what I love about him.

34
00:03:05,552 --> 00:03:08,112
He's so comfortable and safe.

35
00:03:08,288 --> 00:03:10,449
Are you dating a man or a mini-van?

36
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:14,492
My new favorite thing to do
on a Saturday night is Steve's laundry

37
00:03:14,727 --> 00:03:16,558
and I've never been happier.

38
00:03:16,729 --> 00:03:19,892
Your relationship
is my greatest fear realized.

39
00:03:20,066 --> 00:03:23,297
I understand your dilemma
and from my experience,

40
00:03:23,436 --> 00:03:26,667
if he seems too good to be true,
he probably is.

41
00:03:26,839 --> 00:03:30,969
I don't believe this. Now we're
dumping guys for being too available.

42
00:03:31,144 --> 00:03:35,706
This is all solid proof of what
I've read in this great new book.

43
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:38,316
It says if you
really wanna get married,

44
00:03:38,484 --> 00:03:42,113
you shouldn't spend so much time
around dysfunctional single women.

45
00:03:42,288 --> 00:03:43,846
"Marriage Incorporated:

46
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:49,017
"How to apply successful business
strategies to finding a husband".

47
00:03:49,195 --> 00:03:54,030
Chapter one:
"How To Get Ahead By Giving Head".

48
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:58,000
Fine! Make fun.
It's a very smart book.

49
00:03:58,171 --> 00:04:01,663
It encourages professional women
to approach finding a mate

50
00:04:01,841 --> 00:04:06,073
with the dedication and organization
they bring to their careers.

51
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:08,271
I'm more a student of chaos theory.

52
00:04:08,448 --> 00:04:12,282
If you don't see as much of me,
I'm with my married friends.

53
00:04:12,452 --> 00:04:15,944
And how will this help you
meet your mate?

54
00:04:16,122 --> 00:04:21,560
Bachelor friends of married men are
the city's greatest untapped resource.

55
00:04:21,728 --> 00:04:24,219
The way to meet them
is through the husbands.

56
00:04:24,397 --> 00:04:28,561
So my first assignment is to befriend
the husbands. It's my new job.

57
00:04:28,735 --> 00:04:33,263
That evening, as Charlotte began
her new career as a husband-hunter,

58
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:37,432
Miranda returned home to feather
her stress-free love nest.

59
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:42,912
- I heated up some leftover lasagne.
- Great. I'm starving.

60
00:04:43,082 --> 00:04:46,745
- Wanna get some plates?
- What for? It's just us.

61
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,011
An hour later it was on to dessert.

62
00:04:51,591 --> 00:04:55,220
Followed by exactly eight minutes
of no-frills sex.

63
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:59,265
And 12 minutes of "Front Line".

64
00:05:04,237 --> 00:05:09,641
Theirs was the kind of closeness
that only came from true intimacy.

65
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:21,083
Samantha was experiencing intimacy
that only came from anonymity.

66
00:05:21,254 --> 00:05:23,279
His name was Dr. Mark Raskin.

67
00:05:23,456 --> 00:05:25,754
An ear, nose and throat man
that Samantha met...

68
00:05:25,925 --> 00:05:29,759
actually we're not sure where.
Suffice to say it happened quickly.

69
00:05:29,929 --> 00:05:32,056
Will you get me some water, please?

70
00:05:32,231 --> 00:05:35,667
- What for?
- I want to take a hit of Viagra.

71
00:05:38,237 --> 00:05:40,967
Number one -
that's very presumptuous of you.

72
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:42,766
And number two -

73
00:05:42,942 --> 00:05:46,639
from what I can tell, you don't need
any help in that area whatsoever.

74
00:05:46,813 --> 00:05:50,305
I don't need it.
I just take it recreationally.

75
00:05:51,551 --> 00:05:53,314
What does it do for you?

76
00:05:53,486 --> 00:05:57,650
Sends me on a rocket trip
right through your solar system.

77
00:06:01,127 --> 00:06:03,061
I'll be right back with that...

78
00:06:03,229 --> 00:06:04,355
...water.

79
00:06:15,341 --> 00:06:18,538
While Samantha enjoyed
the thrill of the new

80
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:23,148
and Miranda's relationship
happily floated on a placid sea

81
00:06:23,316 --> 00:06:26,342
I was searching for hidden icebergs.

82
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:28,282
Why are you still single?

83
00:06:28,454 --> 00:06:30,615
- Why are you still single?
- Don't do that.

84
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:33,554
I hate it when guys act all cute.

85
00:06:37,563 --> 00:06:40,157
- What?
- Waiting for an apology.

86
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:42,358
OK. I'm a bitch. I'm sorry.

87
00:06:42,535 --> 00:06:45,561
You should know I get a tad bitchy
from time to time.

88
00:06:45,738 --> 00:06:49,799
I'm sure you have your bad traits.
And they would be?

89
00:06:49,976 --> 00:06:52,001
- Alphabetically?
- Whatever you got.

90
00:06:52,178 --> 00:06:55,170
It's all gonna come out eventually,
so I'd like to know now

91
00:06:55,381 --> 00:06:58,043
and that way I can decide
if I'd like to deal with it or not.

92
00:06:58,284 --> 00:07:00,844
This is the strangest two blocks
I ever walked.

93
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:06,458
Again I'm sorry, but this relationship
cannot just sail on like it is: Perfect.

94
00:07:06,626 --> 00:07:08,856
Frankly, I can't take the pressure.

95
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:11,757
OK. I'm gonna kiss you now.

96
00:07:16,803 --> 00:07:21,240
Seriously. What the hell is wrong
with you that you're not married?

97
00:07:21,407 --> 00:07:24,274
- Tell me.
- Can't you relax and go with the flow.

98
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:28,540
Go with the flow? No, I can't do that.
It's so seventies.

99
00:07:28,714 --> 00:07:31,615
How long you think
this phase is gonna last?

100
00:07:31,784 --> 00:07:36,448
My folks are coming this weekend
and I want you to meet them.

101
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:40,759
- That's so...
- Fifties?

102
00:07:43,062 --> 00:07:45,155
That is really nice.

103
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:50,698
So, these parents
that are coming to town...

104
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:54,203
do they know what's wrong with you?

105
00:07:54,373 --> 00:07:57,103
Let's get you a doughnut.

106
00:07:59,011 --> 00:08:00,205
Nuts.

107
00:08:00,947 --> 00:08:04,610
The next evening, taking a page
from "Marriage Incorporated",

108
00:08:04,784 --> 00:08:08,948
Charlotte had dinner with her
married friends, Amy and Dennis.

109
00:08:09,121 --> 00:08:11,555
Allow me to get right to the point.

110
00:08:11,724 --> 00:08:15,558
After careful consideration,
I've decided that I'm getting married.

111
00:08:15,728 --> 00:08:19,562
- Charlotte, that's wonderful!
- Who's the lucky guy?

112
00:08:19,732 --> 00:08:22,599
I don't know yet.
That's where you two come in.

113
00:08:22,768 --> 00:08:27,228
Dennis, name one great single friend
that you have to fix me up with.

114
00:08:27,406 --> 00:08:33,140
I don't know.
No one you'd like offhand.

115
00:08:33,312 --> 00:08:36,475
- What about Phil?
- Phil, yeah.

116
00:08:36,649 --> 00:08:41,609
If he can tear himself away from his
internet company to go on a date.

117
00:08:41,821 --> 00:08:43,345
Yes! Phil.

118
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:44,990
Phil, Phil, Phil.

119
00:08:45,157 --> 00:08:47,352
He is so nice and cute.

120
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:50,826
- You think Phil's cute?
- He's cute.

121
00:08:50,997 --> 00:08:52,328
I can see that.

122
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:57,697
Great. Then it's all set up.
I'll call you tomorrow to follow up.

123
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:00,930
Look! I have tickets
to the opera on Saturday night.

124
00:09:01,107 --> 00:09:04,167
- I would like to take Phil.
- Great.

125
00:09:08,915 --> 00:09:11,907
The next morning before work,
while sorting Steve's laundry,

126
00:09:12,118 --> 00:09:15,986
Miranda came face to face
with the true meaning of intimacy.

127
00:09:22,361 --> 00:09:23,988
I was wrong.

128
00:09:24,163 --> 00:09:27,223
There is a point where a couple
can get too comfortable.

129
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:30,426
I reached it this morning
washing Steve's underwear.

130
00:09:30,636 --> 00:09:32,627
Why, what happened?

131
00:09:32,805 --> 00:09:38,004
- I'm living with "skid marks" guy.
- Oh, no! Terrible.

132
00:09:38,177 --> 00:09:42,170
I don't get it.
Why do men get skid marks?

133
00:09:42,381 --> 00:09:45,043
Is it laziness?
Or are they just in a rush?

134
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:49,620
I don't know but it goes hand in hand
with urinating on the seat.

135
00:09:49,789 --> 00:09:52,690
I tell you one thing. When
your boyfriend is so comfortable

136
00:09:52,858 --> 00:09:57,158
he can't be bothered to wipe his ass,
that's the end of romance.

137
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:59,764
It's certainly the end of laundry night.

138
00:09:59,966 --> 00:10:04,869
It got me thinking. Maybe I mistake
falling into a rut with intimacy.

139
00:10:05,037 --> 00:10:08,029
- How often are you having sex?
- Often enough.

140
00:10:08,207 --> 00:10:10,675
But it's totally generic.
We've got every move down pat.

141
00:10:10,843 --> 00:10:13,869
It's more like a race
to have an orgasm.

142
00:10:14,046 --> 00:10:18,176
- It's nice to be a contestant, isn't it?
- Sure. I know what you mean.

143
00:10:18,351 --> 00:10:22,481
We whine when we don't have
a boyfriend, we whine when we do.

144
00:10:22,655 --> 00:10:27,285
Do you remember how Big
kept me away from his mother?

145
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:30,395
- I remember.
- And how pissed it used to make me?

146
00:10:30,563 --> 00:10:34,829
Now, Aidan's offering both his parents
on a silver platter

147
00:10:35,001 --> 00:10:37,526
and I'm not sure I want to meet them.

148
00:10:37,703 --> 00:10:39,694
Maybe it's too soon.

149
00:10:39,872 --> 00:10:42,898
I've never met Steve's mother
and I'm in no rush.

150
00:10:43,075 --> 00:10:47,273
The irony is Aidan's acting exactly
how I wish Big would have behaved.

151
00:10:47,446 --> 00:10:49,846
And I'm behaving just like Big.

152
00:10:50,016 --> 00:10:54,043
Maybe you don't believe it's for real
unless somebody plays hard to get.

153
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:56,814
When things come too easy,
we're suspect.

154
00:10:56,989 --> 00:11:00,447
Do they have to get complicated
before we believe they're for real?

155
00:11:00,626 --> 00:11:04,255
We're raised to believe that
true love never runs smoothly.

156
00:11:04,463 --> 00:11:06,829
There always have to be
obstacles in Act Two

157
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:09,763
before you can live
happily ever after in Act Three.

158
00:11:09,935 --> 00:11:12,403
But what happens when
the obstacles aren't there?

159
00:11:12,571 --> 00:11:15,233
Does that mean
there's something missing?

160
00:11:15,408 --> 00:11:18,605
Do we need drama
to make a relationship work?

161
00:11:18,778 --> 00:11:22,179
A few days later, still hearing no word
from Dennis about her date

162
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:24,976
Charlotte made a call to his office.

163
00:11:25,151 --> 00:11:28,587
Charlotte Yorke.
He can reach me at home or at work

164
00:11:28,754 --> 00:11:33,282
and it's very important because I have
tickets to the opera on Saturday.

165
00:11:33,459 --> 00:11:36,326
Never mind, just have him call me.

166
00:11:36,495 --> 00:11:40,829
Her call unanswered,
Charlotte followed up persistently.

167
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,197
Can you tell Dennis
that Charlotte Yorke called?

168
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:47,362
Yes, he'll know what it's regarding.

169
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:50,134
It's regarding my future husband, Phil.

170
00:11:50,342 --> 00:11:52,833
OK? Thank you.

171
00:11:53,012 --> 00:11:55,139
Hi. You've reached
the office of Dennis Fincher.

172
00:11:55,314 --> 00:11:57,578
I'm either out of the office
or away from my desk.

173
00:11:57,750 --> 00:12:00,412
Please leave a message
at the sound of the tone.

174
00:12:00,586 --> 00:12:06,388
Well. Obviously, you have some good
reason for keeping Phil and I apart.

175
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:11,656
I can't imagine what it is
but this is Phil's loss and not mine

176
00:12:11,864 --> 00:12:14,560
and don't bother
returning this call either.

177
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:22,104
While Charlotte was a woman on
the verge of a nervous breakdown...

178
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:28,574
...my anxiety-free relationship
was driving me crazy.

179
00:12:34,019 --> 00:12:35,987
Excuse me.

180
00:12:39,492 --> 00:12:43,223
- Sorry it's taking so long.
- That's all right.

181
00:12:43,395 --> 00:12:47,024
I'm gonna have to pass on dinner.
It's getting so late. I've got a deadline.

182
00:12:47,199 --> 00:12:48,962
OK. No problem.

183
00:12:49,135 --> 00:12:52,161
My parents get in tomorrow night.
They'll want to crash.

184
00:12:52,338 --> 00:12:57,366
But I thought you'd meet us
for breakfast the next day.

185
00:12:59,345 --> 00:13:04,339
I've been thinking
about this meeting your parents.

186
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:09,044
- I just wondered if it's a good idea.
- They gonna love you.

187
00:13:09,221 --> 00:13:13,749
No, I'm not worried about that.
Parents always think I'm adorable.

188
00:13:13,926 --> 00:13:16,690
- What's the problem?
- Well...

189
00:13:16,862 --> 00:13:20,696
What if they love me...
and if we break up

190
00:13:20,866 --> 00:13:25,269
you'll always have to explain to them
what happened to the adorable girl.

191
00:13:25,437 --> 00:13:29,032
- Are you breaking up with me?
- No.

192
00:13:31,043 --> 00:13:37,004
Where I come from,
meeting the parents... Oh, so big!

193
00:13:37,183 --> 00:13:40,243
- You'll meet them some other time.
- OK.

194
00:13:40,419 --> 00:13:44,378
So, I guess we won't be seeing
each other this weekend.

195
00:13:46,525 --> 00:13:50,052
- I'll miss you.
- Maybe that's good.

196
00:13:50,229 --> 00:13:54,256
Maybe we should see each other less
then we can miss each other more.

197
00:13:56,402 --> 00:14:00,930
You're so available to me,
and I'm so available to you.

198
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:04,371
Maybe we're both too...

199
00:14:06,378 --> 00:14:07,640
...available.

200
00:14:07,813 --> 00:14:10,407
Carrie, it's no big deal.
I have a life.

201
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:12,574
I'm just making room for you.

202
00:14:12,751 --> 00:14:15,777
You always say the right things.

203
00:14:18,824 --> 00:14:21,292
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

204
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:40,069
This is nuts. I'm sabotaging
the best relationship I've ever had.

205
00:14:40,279 --> 00:14:45,307
It's better to have a man waiting
for you than the other way around.

206
00:14:45,484 --> 00:14:48,749
- I guess.
- And if you hadn't been available,

207
00:14:48,954 --> 00:14:52,151
I'd be here alone,
just some pathetic dateless freak.

208
00:14:52,324 --> 00:14:54,451
So glad it worked out for you.

209
00:14:54,627 --> 00:14:58,791
- Who are you calling?
- I'm not taking this lying down.

210
00:15:01,166 --> 00:15:04,727
Hi. You've reached Amy and Dennis.
Leave it at the beep.

211
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:10,001
Well, here I am at the opera
which I planned on going to with Phil,

212
00:15:10,175 --> 00:15:13,144
who I guess you've decided
I'm not good enough for.

213
00:15:13,312 --> 00:15:15,780
Charlotte?
It's Dennis.

214
00:15:15,948 --> 00:15:18,644
I'm so sorry.
I just got back from a business trip.

215
00:15:18,817 --> 00:15:21,581
My secretary gave me
all your messages.

216
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:24,621
I had no idea
you wanted to meet Phil so badly.

217
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:28,157
Well, he sounded nice.
It's not a big deal.

218
00:15:28,327 --> 00:15:32,559
Why don't I set something up
tomorrow evening? 7:30?

219
00:15:32,998 --> 00:15:35,626
- You know Rudy's, Midtown?
- I love that place.

220
00:15:35,801 --> 00:15:41,239
Phil will meet you there.
I guarantee it.

221
00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:49,039
I'm so silly. I created all that drama
in my head for nothing.

222
00:15:49,214 --> 00:15:51,580
- What are we seeing again?
- "Aida."

223
00:16:01,126 --> 00:16:06,621
- I guess I'm in for another wild ride.
- I'd say we both are.

224
00:16:08,334 --> 00:16:12,464
What would happen
if I tried one of these?

225
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:16,233
I don't think they've established
that it works for women.

226
00:16:16,408 --> 00:16:19,275
There's no harm in trying is there,
doctor?

227
00:16:21,213 --> 00:16:23,238
Bottoms up!

228
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:30,652
20 minutes later,

229
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:34,987
Samantha officially became
the first woman to land on the moon.

230
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:53,907
- Isn't the opera romantic?
- Even more so with a man.

231
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:56,206
Well, I did expect to be taking Phil.

232
00:16:56,382 --> 00:16:59,647
It's quite a lovely evening you planned
for a man you've never even met.

233
00:16:59,885 --> 00:17:01,910
He sounded really nice.

234
00:17:02,087 --> 00:17:04,419
- Here.
- Thanks.

235
00:17:44,129 --> 00:17:47,758
You know what, honey,
I'm not feeling well. I'm going home.

236
00:17:47,933 --> 00:17:50,993
- Do you want me to come with you?
- No, I'm fine. Stay, enjoy.

237
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:53,331
It's all right. I'll call you.

238
00:17:58,510 --> 00:18:00,535
I'll be right back.

239
00:18:00,712 --> 00:18:03,112
I knew it was rude and over-dramatic,

240
00:18:03,315 --> 00:18:06,842
but I felt like I'd just seen
the phantom of the opera.

241
00:18:15,727 --> 00:18:18,594
Yes, ditching Charlotte
was slightly hysterical,

242
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:21,665
but the idea of sitting across
from Big and Natasha

243
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:27,031
through the second act of "Aida"
was too emotional to bear.

244
00:18:30,309 --> 00:18:32,743
This time I knew what was wrong.

245
00:18:32,911 --> 00:18:35,971
The shock of seeing Big again
not only made my stomach flip

246
00:18:36,148 --> 00:18:39,015
it sent my spleen leaping
right into my throat.

247
00:18:47,059 --> 00:18:50,995
- Hello.
- It's me. I'm really sorry.

248
00:18:51,196 --> 00:18:56,793
- What's wrong?
- I saw Big tonight at the opera.

249
00:18:57,002 --> 00:19:00,529
- That's why you ditched Charlotte.
- She told you. Was she pissed?

250
00:19:00,706 --> 00:19:03,834
I think she's swearing
off women forever.

251
00:19:04,009 --> 00:19:08,708
- Are you OK?
- Yeah. I'm great actually.

252
00:19:08,881 --> 00:19:12,977
I'm realizing that maybe there is
something to this available man thing.

253
00:19:14,286 --> 00:19:19,553
Yeah. It's kind of nice.
Just separate your whites.

254
00:19:19,725 --> 00:19:24,059
Now I know I wanna be with a man
who wants to be with me.

255
00:19:24,229 --> 00:19:26,823
I've had enough relationship drama
for one lifetime.

256
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:29,126
Shouldn't you be telling this to Aidan?

257
00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:33,771
It's 3:00 am.
I'll wait until a more civilized hour.

258
00:19:33,939 --> 00:19:37,932
The next morning I waited
until a decent hour to call Aidan

259
00:19:38,143 --> 00:19:41,203
and tell him how much I missed him.

260
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:44,349
- Furniture Company.
- Hi, it's Carrie calling for Aidan.

261
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:47,383
- He's not here right now.
- He's not?

262
00:19:47,553 --> 00:19:51,080
- Just tell him I called.
- I'll give him the message.

263
00:19:51,256 --> 00:19:53,281
- Thanks.
- Bye.

264
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:01,389
When I hadn't heard from him
by that evening

265
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:04,398
I began to get butterflies
in my stomach.

266
00:20:06,772 --> 00:20:09,570
Hey, I'm not in but Pete is.

267
00:20:10,442 --> 00:20:13,275
Hey. It's Carrie.
Remember me?

268
00:20:13,445 --> 00:20:17,404
The girl you wanted to introduce
to your parents.

269
00:20:17,583 --> 00:20:19,983
I'm just calling to say hey.

270
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:22,717
Hey.

271
00:20:25,624 --> 00:20:30,288
I was getting a dreaded feeling
that I had played this all wrong.

272
00:20:30,462 --> 00:20:34,899
Suddenly, the idea of losing Aidan
left me short of breath.

273
00:20:37,569 --> 00:20:42,336
Meanwhile, Miranda was trying not
to breathe near Steve's shorts.

274
00:20:46,945 --> 00:20:49,209
What are you doing?

275
00:20:49,414 --> 00:20:52,975
I thought you might need some help
with the wash.

276
00:20:53,151 --> 00:20:56,245
But there's nothing like a twist
in the third act

277
00:20:56,421 --> 00:20:59,151
to spice up even
the most banal scenario.

278
00:21:01,226 --> 00:21:04,423
And while Miranda and Steve
found new life in the familiar,

279
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:09,192
Charlotte was blindly feeling
her way through the unfamiliar.

280
00:21:11,637 --> 00:21:15,073
Excuse me.
Are you Phil?

281
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:16,673
Sorry.

282
00:21:20,012 --> 00:21:24,506
- Are you Phil?
- I could be.

283
00:21:24,683 --> 00:21:27,709
- Hi.
- Well, hello.

284
00:21:27,886 --> 00:21:31,083
- Are you here to chaperone?
- Yes, sort of.

285
00:21:32,991 --> 00:21:36,017
What's wrong?
You couldn't trust me alone with Phil?

286
00:21:36,194 --> 00:21:39,789
Charlotte, Phil's not coming...
I never called Phil.

287
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:43,833
I didn't want you to meet him. You'd
like him and that could be a problem.

288
00:21:44,636 --> 00:21:48,766
- What are you talking about?
- I'm in love with you, Charlotte.

289
00:21:49,174 --> 00:21:52,337
You can't be in love with me -
you're married to my friend.

290
00:21:52,511 --> 00:21:58,006
Things haven't been great with us,
and I can't stop thinking about you.

291
00:21:58,183 --> 00:22:00,777
- This is nuts.
- Don't leave.

292
00:22:00,952 --> 00:22:04,979
You kept your single friends
away from me so you could cheat?

293
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:09,192
- You should be ashamed of yourself.
- You're such a spark plug. I love that.

294
00:22:09,361 --> 00:22:12,262
I'm not interested
in starting some married man's car.

295
00:22:12,464 --> 00:22:15,399
Wait. Don't leave, please.
I love you!

296
00:22:16,835 --> 00:22:19,463
Charlotte, please. I love you. Wait.

297
00:22:20,605 --> 00:22:24,837
- Taxi!
- What the hell?

298
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:29,079
Are you all right?

299
00:22:29,681 --> 00:22:33,447
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, thanks.

300
00:22:33,618 --> 00:22:36,519
- Let me help you.
- Thanks.

301
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:45,088
- I'm Trey.
- Charlotte.

302
00:22:46,098 --> 00:22:49,033
And that's how,
in the most dramatic fashion,

303
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:51,795
Charlotte met her new leading man.

304
00:23:01,179 --> 00:23:04,148
Well, time to pop
one of those baby blues.

305
00:23:04,316 --> 00:23:06,341
Let's go au naturel this time.

306
00:23:06,485 --> 00:23:11,184
No, I really want one.

307
00:23:11,323 --> 00:23:15,123
- Don't you think it's good without it?
- No, I do not!

308
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:17,285
Let's save it for those special times.

309
00:23:17,462 --> 00:23:20,192
Give me my pills, goddammit!

310
00:23:20,365 --> 00:23:25,667
Mark realized he had brought too
much intensity to their relationship.

311
00:23:25,837 --> 00:23:28,431
He wrote Samantha a prescription

312
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:31,302
and she promised
never to call him again.

313
00:23:33,211 --> 00:23:35,679
You have no messages.

314
00:23:36,648 --> 00:23:39,674
After two days
of not hearing from Aidan,

315
00:23:39,851 --> 00:23:43,844
I realized only a dramatic gesture
could salvage things.

316
00:23:52,297 --> 00:23:54,595
- You gonna...
- Hi, how are you?

317
00:23:54,766 --> 00:23:56,859
You're gonna like this.

318
00:24:10,048 --> 00:24:11,879
What's going on?

319
00:24:12,050 --> 00:24:15,611
You asked me to be here,
and I wasn't sure if I could.

320
00:24:16,655 --> 00:24:21,058
Honestly... I mean,
meeting the parents is so...

321
00:24:21,259 --> 00:24:25,628
Then I realized I wanna meet them but
I didn't know if you still wanted me to.

322
00:24:25,797 --> 00:24:30,461
I've called and you haven't called me,
so then I thought I'm just gonna go,

323
00:24:30,635 --> 00:24:37,097
because being in a relationship
means taking a risk... a leap of faith.

324
00:24:37,275 --> 00:24:42,008
No matter how many times one
might have been disappointed before.

325
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:47,982
I said to myself I'm just gonna show
up... because you're a good man.

326
00:24:49,421 --> 00:24:52,151
A really good man.

327
00:24:54,826 --> 00:24:59,957
- Why haven't you called me back?
- I was just trying to be less available.

328
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:02,999
Really?

329
00:25:06,404 --> 00:25:08,770
You don't have to do everything I say.

330
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:14,037
Well, you're here now.
Can I introduce you to my parents?

331
00:25:14,212 --> 00:25:17,443
- Won't they think I'm nuts?
- Probably.

332
00:25:17,616 --> 00:25:20,176
They'll just have to get used to that.

333
00:25:21,019 --> 00:25:22,850
Come on, Nuts.

334
00:25:23,522 --> 00:25:27,185
I realized then, that I had made
my stomach flip all on my own.

335
00:25:29,394 --> 00:25:31,692
And it felt really nice.

(Previously)
Sis, it’s okay for you
to accept jobs like that.

2
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,839
But what if people
take advantage of you?

3
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:17,239
I don’t care.

4
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:19,959
Don’t cause anymore trouble at work.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,239
- Yes, Brother.
- Don’t just say "Yes, Brother".

6
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:25,999
What if you don’t get a job?
I can’t help you anymore.

7
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:27,719
I want to apologize.

8
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:31,159
My problem with Doni really put me down.

9
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:33,439
Neti, I’m here.

10
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:35,579
- Bima, hurry!
- Neti! Neti!

11
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:37,020
Neti!

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,480
Neti.

13
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:45,544
Neti.

14
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:47,590
Net.

15
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:50,879
Neti, wake up!

16
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:54,239
Maria, go get help, call the neighbors.

17
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:56,080
Get a vehicle if you can.

18
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:58,920
Maria, now!

19
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,679
- What’s wrong, Maria?
- Ma’am.

20
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:09,049
Neti.

21
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,546
- Heri, please help me.
- What?

22
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:39,319
Hey, quick, help her!
Look at me helping her!

23
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:42,217
Ali, get a car! Help us get a car!

24
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,919
- Doc, how is she?
- Yes.

25
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:57,700
Is she fine?

26
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,519
Are you two her relative?

27
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,839
- Yes, Doc.
- So,...

28
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,741
Her condition right now
is not concerning.

29
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:09,319
Luckily, the patient only swallowed
a small amount of the liquid.

30
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,159
Doctor, but is she awake yet?

31
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:14,279
No, at the moment she’s not awake.

32
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:15,919
I still need to check up on her.

33
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:18,879
Including her mentality.

34
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:22,676
But I will ask a psychiatrist
to check on the patient.

35
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:30,840
- Mar, how’s Neti?
- Well,...

36
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:33,439
The floor cleaner liquid
is not concerning.

37
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:35,480
Only swallowed some patients.

38
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:38,714
I have explained...

39
00:02:38,755 --> 00:02:41,599
that her condition is not concerning
at this moment.

40
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:43,239
So she’s still stable.

41
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,199
Okay, that’ll be all.

42
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,799
Thank you, I’m in a hurry.

43
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:49,520
- Doc.
- Prita.

44
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:53,239
The doctor’s in a hurry,
he has a surgery.

45
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,999
- You do?
- No.

46
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,754
I just need to pee.

47
00:02:57,320 --> 00:03:00,519
What a coincidence.
I too have been holding back!

48
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:03,889
- Where’s the latrine?
- I’ll show you.

49
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:09,769
- Neti.
- I can't hold it back any longer, Doc.

50
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:13,437
I haven’t paid my debt to you!

51
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:20,119
-What are we doing?
-Singing, Mar.

Ndah.

Prit.

66
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,599
- Neti.
- Maria.

67
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:20,479
Net, you're awake.

68
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:21,778
Neti.

69
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,039
I’m sorry.

70
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,919
I’ve been troubling you.

71
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:30,160
It’s alright, Neti.

72
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,779
The...

73
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:37,660
The hospital bill. How much is it, Mar?

74
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:41,160
- Get well first.
- Oh my God.

75
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:44,480
I’m so stupid, huh? So stupid!

76
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:49,080
Neti, don’t say that.

77
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:51,159
I’m so sorry.

78
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:53,699
Shut up, it’s alright.

79
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:57,458
But you...
Don’t do this again, promise us.

80
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,199
What’s with you anyway?

81
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:03,039
So stupid, drinking toilet cleaner.

82
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:05,039
Are your intestines dirty?

83
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:07,279
And you drank Wispol.

84
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:08,890
That wouldn’t kill you.

85
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:14,779
- I’m sorry.
- Neti, thank goodness you’re awake.

86
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:16,187
You’re late.

87
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:19,040
- I’m sorry, Ndah.
- It's okay.

88
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,155
Excuse me.

89
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:25,280
- Do you feel better?
- Yes.

90
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:30,079
- Nurse, slowly.
- I’m sorry.

91
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,839
Jeje?

92
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:33,252
Jeje?

93
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:42,679
Nurse, may we know what happened to her?

94
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:46,766
The usual. She got hit by a car
because she made TekTok video on a bike.

95
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,839
- Got hit, huh?
- You know her?

96
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:52,319
- Of course.
- How nice. A reunion...

97
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,473
with your friends.

98
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:57,932
Who is she?

99
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:00,639
This is Jeje.

100
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:03,459
She used to live
in our boarding house too. Right, Prit?

101
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:05,839
She’s a good girl.

102
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:08,716
She never let us starve.

103
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,759
True. She is so kind.

104
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:14,719
Never steal our money. Right?

105
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:18,468
Never steal prize money too, right?

106
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:21,019
- Take that!
- Nurse.

107
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:23,159
I wanna change room.

108
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:26,319
Wait. The nurse said
we can have a reunion, right?

109
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:29,239
- No, Nurse. Move me to another room.
- Stay here!

110
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,160
This room is evil, Nurse!

111
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,653
Help me.

112
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,559
Help me.

113
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,462
Nurse.

114
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:46,017
Let’s check that way.

115
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,135
Watch it, I’ll get you.

116
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:57,440
Bim.

117
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:02,119
Can you help me?
Buy me some fruit at the store.

118
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,879
I want to bring some when I visit Neti.

119
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,137
Alright, Auntie.

120
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:17,119
Hello, Auntie.
Is Dika really coming home?

121
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:21,399
I’m afraid he’s pranking me,
after I come all the way to the airport.

122
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:24,339
Yes, he called me last night.

123
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:27,119
It’s unusual. He normally come home
for Eid al Fitr.

124
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:31,465
Well, as long as it's true,
not just a hoax. I’ll pick him up.

125
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:34,659
You’re such a good kid.

126
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:37,919
If you were a girl,
I’d make you my daughter-in-law.

127
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:42,403
I’m sorry, Auntie. Dika’s not my type.

128
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,479
Oh you.

129
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:46,439
Alright, I’ll pick Dika up.

130
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:49,600
- Alright. Thank you.
- You're welcome, Auntie.

131
00:07:58,480 --> 00:07:59,929
What’s wrong, Auntie?

132
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,960
It’s nothing.

133
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,645
Dika is coming home.

134
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:09,836
So, are you coming home?

135
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,499
Yes.

136
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:15,399
I’ll tell my parents first, Auntie.

137
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:19,039
I'll legalize all my papers too. But...

138
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:21,319
I guess I can’t meet Dika.

139
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,669
It’s alright.

140
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:28,679
Let us visit you later
at your parents' house.

141
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:29,859
Alright?

142
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,000
Right, Auntie.

143
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:37,869
Here, I sew your button.

144
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:41,040
Thanks, Auntie.

145
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:44,119
Babe, we need to go back.

146
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:46,400
I hope you leave soon.

147
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:49,420
I mean leave this hospital.

148
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:53,760
- Thank you.
- Bye, everyone.

149
00:08:57,400 --> 00:09:00,080
- Neti.
- Ma’am.

150
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,800
Gosh.

151
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,079
Here, Auntie.

152
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,440
- Let me.
- This is for Neti.

153
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,679
You look better.

154
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:09,679
When can you leave
according to the doctor?

155
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,519
Yes, thank goodness getting I’m better.

156
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:14,559
Doctor said I can go home tomorrow.

157
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:17,248
- Praise be to Allah.
- Thank you, Ma’am.

158
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:20,479
Bim, thank you for helping
with the paperworks.

159
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:22,679
It’s alright, relax.

160
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,829
Come sit, Ma’am.

161
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:27,955
- Bima.
- Mar.

162
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:32,199
I have...

163
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:35,520
something to talk with you outside.

164
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,048
Me too.

165
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:41,832
Excuse us, everyone.

166
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,889
Bima.

167
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:49,319
I have a surprise for you.

168
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,649
What’s that?

169
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:01,399
- Sis.
- Hi, Maria.

170
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,039
What a surprise for you to call me.

171
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:05,237
Somebody wants to talk to you.

172
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,819
- Is that you, Bima?
- Miss Lisa.

173
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:15,156
- How are you?
- I’m fine.

174
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:17,839
I passed the Civil Officer test.

175
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:21,879
Congratulations, Bima. That’s awesome.

176
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:25,119
- Thank yo so much, Miss.
- You’re welcome, Bima.

177
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:27,441
Congratulations once again.

178
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,357
Yes, Miss.

179
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:36,559
Bima, what did you wanna talk about?

180
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,643
I want to say goodbye, Mar.

181
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,700
I need to go home.

182
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:49,232
So many paperwork to take care of.

183
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:53,240
And there’s a chance...

184
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,761
that I have to move out of town.

185
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:04,352
I wanted to tell you since yesterday.

186
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:08,933
- But with Neti’s incident, I thought...
- When are you leaving?

187
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,280
This afternoon.

188
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,480
Bima.

189
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:26,997
Keep your spirits up.

190
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:30,590
I’m sure you’ll be a great nurse.

191
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:34,760
That’s what you always want to be.

192
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:41,139
You'll be able to cure many people,
gain knowledge,...

193
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:43,755
- meet a lot of people...
- Maria.

194
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,724
Thank you so much.

195
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,116
Let’s go.

196
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:04,880
Mar.

197
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:09,824
Let’s go.

198
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,320
Thank you, Ndah.

199
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:21,620
- Is your hand clean?
- It’s clean.

200
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:33,080
Yeah, so...

201
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,040
Maria.

202
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,086
Endah.

203
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:41,688
Neti.

204
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,720
Maria.

205
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:46,560
- You’re skipping me?
- Prita.

206
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,479
I’m saying goodbye.

207
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:50,039
Where are you going?

208
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:52,359
Saying goodbye like a Youtuber.

209
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:54,350
I’m going back home.

210
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,536
Yeah?

211
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:58,987
Because...

212
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:01,859
I past the Civil Officer test.

213
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:04,999
Praise be to Allah.
Congratulations, Bim.

214
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,658
I hope you serve well.

215
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:09,079
Congratulations.

216
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:11,819
Yes, Bim, keep your spirits up.

217
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:13,679
So you’re a Civil Officer now?

218
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:16,799
Don’t be corrupt.
If it’s not lunch hour yet...

219
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:18,739
don’t go out to buy stew.

220
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:21,279
Don’t take money from people.

221
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:23,508
Goodness!

222
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,839
Prit, not like that.

223
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:27,639
I don’t work at the office, Prit.

224
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:31,519
I’ll still be a nurse,
but with Civil Servant status.

225
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,799
Oh, I see.

226
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:36,639
I thought you’ll be like those officers.

227
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:39,558
I was about to teach you to play Zuma.

228
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,959
Do you know Zuma?

229
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,999
You know that drink?

230
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:47,294
Jamu!

231
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,717
Funny, isn’t it?

232
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:58,280
I really miss this place.

233
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,880
It’s only been two days, Net.

234
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:06,439
I really need to move on.

235
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,239
I can’t go on like this.

236
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:12,600
I’m sure, Net. You’ll get over him.

237
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:16,416
Not getting over, Ndah. But...

238
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:21,153
Find a new place. Move on means
finding a new place, right?

239
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:25,131
I have to start form zero again.

240
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:28,059
Find a new environment.

241
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:30,012
First,...

242
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:33,650
I guess I’ll quit
being a make up artist.

243
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:36,260
So I won’t see Doni anymore.

244
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,319
Second,...

245
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,605
I think I’ll have to find
a new boarding house.

246
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:45,240
So you won’t live here anymore?

247
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:50,799
Why do you have to move out, Net?

248
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:54,488
Doni was the one who told me
of this boarding house.

249
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:56,880
He told me to live here.

250
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:03,150
I understand your reasons.

251
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,820
But if you move out...

252
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:10,372
we’ll be sad.

253
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,519
It’s alright.

254
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:16,920
Even if we live separately,
we'll still be friends.

255
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:19,974
It’s for my sake.

256
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:22,560
Help me to move on.

257
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:27,198
Then what should we help you with, Neti?

258
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:31,406
Help me find a new boarding house.

259
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:35,810
Neti.

260
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,095
Don’t leave.

261
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:47,399
You want me to ask my followers?

262
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:50,578
It’s easy, Prita told me yesterday.

263
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:54,439
Yes, Ris, perhaps your followers can...

264
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,800
- give me some info.
- Okay.

265
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:59,163
- Let’s go live now, okay?
- Yes.

266
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:05,882
Hi guys, how are you?
It's me Riska Meong.

267
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:10,173
Right, guys.
So I’m looking for a boarding house.

268
00:16:10,214 --> 00:16:14,439
Now, if you know a good place,
please leave a comment.

269
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,039
Your sister is awesome.

270
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,240
True.

271
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:19,509
Neti, somebody left a comment.

272
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:23,959
From Rio Montok.
He said there’s one in Mampang.

273
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,439
The rent is 400.000 a month.

274
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:27,559
- Not bad.
- But...

275
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:31,738
the place has flies during the day,
and snakes during the night.

276
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:35,839
Not bad. Take it, Net.

277
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:39,239
You can compete
with Panji The Conqueror.

278
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:41,134
Prita.

279
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:44,797
- Anything else?
- Okay, let’s look some more.

280
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,699
Oh, this one’s from Acihuy.

281
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:49,360
His boarding house is in Cawang.

282
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:51,760
Only 300.000 a month.

283
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,200
Wow, this one’s interesting.

284
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:56,839
It’s fully furnished with TV,
AirCon, Wi-fi.

285
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,999
- I’ll take that.
- But...

286
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:01,560
they steal the electricity.

287
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:04,179
What if the police catch me?

288
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:06,829
Nevermind, only 3 years in prison.

289
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:10,119
3 years, that’s quite long.

290
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,600
Shut up.

291
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:14,781
- None is appropriate.
- Let's look some more.

292
00:17:14,822 --> 00:17:16,359
Guys, leave a comment.

293
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,798
- Here, you can check by yourself.
- Okay.

294
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:21,079
Hello guys.

295
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:24,198
Help me out, I need info
about boarding houses.

296
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,859
"Who is this? Hey!"

297
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:29,959
“Who is this maid, filling my screen?”

298
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,239
- Why are they mocking me?
- Hey, who’s that?

299
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:33,679
Where do you live?

300
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:36,279
Hey, I’m tagging your face!
I’ll find you!

301
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:39,170
How dare you mock Neti! That’s my job!

302
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,459
There, there.

303
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:43,399
Sorry guys, a little disturbance.

304
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:46,880
Right, thank you so much for your info
about boarding houses.

305
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:49,479
See you again on my live videos,
Riska Meong.

306
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:50,391
Bye!

307
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:57,303
- Did you get anything good?
- None.

308
00:17:58,180 --> 00:17:59,351
Be patient.

309
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:03,912
Just ask your followers
for the worst boarding houses.

310
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:05,839
Okay, I understand.

311
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:07,699
Give me Neti’s IG,
let me block her for now.

312
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:10,620
@Neti36C

313
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:13,476
Okay.

314
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,779
Hi guys. Let’s play a fun game.

315
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:19,519
Tomorrow, tell me how bad
your boarding house is.

316
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:21,479
You can just join my live session.

317
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:24,879
And leave a comment about the weirdest
and ugliest boarding house you know.

318
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:26,879
For the funniest comment,
I’ll follow you back.

319
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:28,760
Okay, see you.

320
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:33,760
- How about that boarding house?
- No.

321
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:41,776
What do you say?

322
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:44,410
Gosh. I have no idea.

323
00:18:44,451 --> 00:18:47,119
I don’t know
about female boarding houses.

324
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:50,879
I only know boarding houses
for male and mixed.

325
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:52,160
Are you interested?

326
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:55,340
No thanks, Bro. Come on, Mar.

327
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:57,879
- Oh right.
- Hey, Maria.

328
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:00,971
Wait here, I need to talk.

329
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,320
What, Brother?

330
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:12,239
I need to talk to my sister.

331
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:14,639
Can you move away a bit?

332
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:16,880
Oh, just say so.

333
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,915
Not far enough!

334
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:27,947
I need to talk to her.

335
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:36,852
Alright, Mar. I’ll wait over there.

336
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:40,870
- Okay, Net. Neti, please wait for me.
- Yes.

337
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:44,761
Sister, did you quit
from the restaurant?

338
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:48,899
You didn’t tell me,
you think I wouldn’t know?

339
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:50,519
What do you want?

340
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:54,013
You work, and you cause trouble.

341
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,800
Just go home.

342
00:19:57,300 --> 00:20:00,159
- Don’t trouble me here.
- But Brother, I...

343
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,759
But what?

344
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:04,199
You can’t get your attitude up.

345
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:06,678
I don’t think you're fit
to work in Jakarta.

346
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:10,199
You think people
can easily give you trust?

347
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,999
You always follow your own thoughts.

348
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:15,400
Always follow your own will.

349
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:19,245
I feel bad as well.

350
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,799
I’m actually glad
that you're in Jakarta.

351
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:25,489
And I promised to take care of you!

352
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:30,979
But if you keep behaving like this,
what can I do?

353
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:34,032
I don’t think
I can take care of you anymore.

354
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:37,682
Go back to the village.

355
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:46,679
Brother, I’ll...

356
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:49,312
think about it first.

357
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:56,100
Brother, I’m leaving.

358
00:20:56,860 --> 00:20:58,172
Take care.

359
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:10,319
I wonder.

360
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:12,919
Why is it so hard
to find a boarding house?

361
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:17,087
Maybe it means
you shouldn’t move out from here, Net.

362
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:19,959
I can’t do that, Ndah.

363
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,040
If I don’t move out,
I’ll always remember him.

364
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:28,259
I think I’ll go home
to my parents’ house.

365
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:31,784
So you’ll be leaving tomorrow?

366
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:36,377
And I think...

367
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:39,078
I’ll stay there for a while.

368
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:43,471
I’m sorry for all my mistakes.

369
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:45,809
I’ve been troubling you a lot.

370
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:50,375
I think I have to go home too.

371
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:54,389
Are you leaving too, Mar?

372
00:21:54,935 --> 00:21:58,379
Yes, I... I met my brother.

373
00:21:58,420 --> 00:22:01,879
He said, if I still can’t find a job...

374
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:04,283
I have to go back to the village.

375
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:07,560
I'm sorry, Mar.

376
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:10,479
There, there.

377
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:13,079
We’ll have to say goodbye
sooner or later.

378
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:15,717
Okay? Endah will move out soon too.

379
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:18,239
Is that true, Ndah?

380
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:19,900
So I’ll be left alone?

381
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:22,119
I mean, Endah is in college.

382
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:24,659
She’ll graduate, she'll go to work.

383
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:26,799
It’ll be good if she works near.
But if not?

384
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:28,602
She’ll have to move out, right?

385
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:33,760
- Don’t cry.
- I'm not.

386
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:42,014
- She cries because you tease her.
- Gosh.

387
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:44,759
Dad!

388
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:46,345
Dad!

389
00:22:46,386 --> 00:22:50,558
- Dad. Lebaysimida.
- Tololaseo.

390
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:53,359
- Neti.
- Enough.

391
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:55,719
- Prita, you!
- Let me join you.

392
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:58,680
- No!
- I'm sorry.

393
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:04,755
Let us help you pack.

394
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:35,939
Let’s sleep.

395
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:37,628
I’ll pinch your lips.

396
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:44,405
- So you’re leaving, Net?
- Yes, Ma’am.

397
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:48,241
But since I haven’t found a new place...

398
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:52,860
I'll go back to my parents’ house first.

399
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:54,604
This afternoon.

400
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:01,892
Well, I can’t stop you.

401
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:06,367
You must have thought
that it’s best for you too.

402
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:09,880
I’m sorry, Ma’am.

403
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:12,480
For all my mistakes.

404
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:14,937
I’m sorry...

405
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:19,014
for causing trouble with the girls.

406
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:22,280
It’s nothing. Likewise, Net.

407
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:28,040
- You have paid full for the rent.
- Yes.

408
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:29,439
So...

409
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:32,729
I won’t be renting your room.

410
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:35,879
Just in case you...

411
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:40,151
miss your room,
you can return here. Okay?

412
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:42,584
Thank you, Ma’am.

413
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,199
- Hey, Ma'am.
- Peace be upon you.

414
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:54,519
- Peace be upon you too. Come in.
- Okay. Thank you.

415
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:58,559
Neti, please make two drinks.

416
00:24:58,600 --> 00:24:59,894
We have some guests.

417
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:03,117
- Excuse me, Ma’am.
- Yes.

418
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:07,639
- I'm sorry for coming this early.
- It’s alright.

419
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:10,119
- What is it, Ma’am?
- Here’s the thing, Ms. Ratih.

420
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:13,839
I need to ask for a favor,
I want to order tumpeng for an event.

421
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:16,559
A grand opening of my hijab store
in Kalibata.

422
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:19,199
- You should come.
- Right.

423
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:21,359
How awesome.

424
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:24,010
- Your outlets are everywhere.
- Praise be to Allah.

425
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:27,000
Oh, one more thing.

426
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:29,439
I’m looking for a store clerk.

427
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:32,079
I haven’t got a clerk
for my hijab store.

428
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:35,439
This is a female boarding house, right?

429
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:39,829
Maybe you can ask around,
perhaps someone wants to work there.

430
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:42,709
Miss, are you interested?

431
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:46,074
Sorry, Ma’am. I can’t.

432
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:50,639
But do you have a specific condition
for the applicant?

433
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:54,039
Like religion or race?

434
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:57,679
Oh no.
Just like the name of my brand,...

435
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:00,879
Nusantara Hijab. Anyone can work there.

436
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:03,639
I need an honest and diligent person.

437
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:06,774
- Oh, then please wait, Ma’am.
- Yes.

438
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:09,320
Maria.

439
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:10,809
Maria.

440
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,403
Forgive me, Mother. I mean this Maria.

441
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:17,720
Maria, wake up.

442
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:20,120
Don’t you want a job? Maria.

443
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:21,879
Goodness.

444
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:24,399
In the name of God. Maria.

445
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:25,633
Maria.

446
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:30,019
Why did you baptize me again?
I’m already baptized.

447
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:32,420
Mar, do you want a job? Come on.

448
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:34,760
- Mar.
- I do.

449
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:37,560
Tastes good?

450
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:40,919
- A little salty.
- Come on, do you want a job?

451
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,599
- I do.
- Come, clean yourself.

452
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:46,039
Let’s get you a job. Good girl.
Let's go.

453
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:49,680
That one you made, so delicious.

454
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:52,879
Here she is, Ma’am.
Do you think she qualifies?

455
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:55,952
Oh, yes. Alright.

456
00:26:56,840 --> 00:27:00,359
So, this lady has a hijab store, Mar.

457
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:03,076
And she needs a clerk.

458
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:06,679
Hijab store?

459
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:09,850
- Yes.
- But I’m...

460
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:12,599
It doesn’t matter.

461
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:15,359
Anyone is accepted to work at my store.

462
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:17,820
We don’t discriminate race or religion.

463
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:19,519
Where are you from?

464
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:21,919
I’m from Merauke, Papua, Ma’am.

465
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:24,819
Wow, I’ve never had an employee
from Papua.

466
00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:26,899
Would you like to work at my store?

467
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:29,799
Praise the Lord.

468
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:33,799
Ma’am, thank you
for accepting me at your store.

469
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:35,959
Dear God, Neti. I’m so happy.

470
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,400
I don’t have to return to my village.

471
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:40,717
Ma’am, thank you so much.

472
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:49,151
Mar, I leave this house in your care,
and these women.

473
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:51,720
Ndah.

474
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:55,426
Study well so you can graduate in time.

475
00:27:55,467 --> 00:27:58,427
Don’t watch too many Korean dramas.
It's too much fantasy.

476
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:02,479
- There she goes, crying again.
- I’m not.

477
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:04,239
- You too, Prit.
- What?

478
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:06,239
Don’t fight with your sister.

479
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:09,359
My room is unoccupied,
your sister can use it.

480
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:10,885
Can my dad use it?

481
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:14,085
No, Ms. Ratih might come in.

482
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,400
Just kidding, Ma’am.

483
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:19,839
How about my future boyfriend?
Can he stays there?

484
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:21,280
Remember God.

485
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:25,243
Ma’am, I have something for you.

486
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:32,119
Hello, I’m Roy Marten.

487
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:33,760
I’d like to say...

488
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:38,299
- Say what?
- Anything. Perhaps just a greeting.

489
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:42,600
Or a happy birthday, happy Eid al Fitr.
Anything, Sir.

490
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:44,639
Hello.

491
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:47,359
I’m Roy Marten
I’d like to say, sleep tight...

492
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:50,515
- for Ms. Ratna.
- Ms. Ratih.

493
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:53,956
- Sleep tight, Ms. Ratih.
- Okay.

494
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:56,530
- Oh, he's not finished yet.
- Hold on.

495
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:00,399
Don’t forget to pray.

496
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:02,315
Have a nice dream, Ma’am.

497
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:05,044
He's still not finished.

498
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:10,157
God blesses you. Bye, Ma’am.

499
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:15,552
Neti, when did you receive this?

500
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:17,740
Yesterday at the hospital.

501
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:20,799
I was having a video call with Cahyo.
Turned out that...

502
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:22,679
Cahyo was doing Mr. Roy’s make up.

503
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,679
I remember your wish, so I asked him.

504
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:26,720
Thank you so much.

505
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:28,903
Ask him to marry you.

506
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:30,560
Neti.

507
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:32,999
Before you go home...

508
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:36,140
I’d like to take you all for lunch.

509
00:29:36,181 --> 00:29:40,239
Take it as a commemoration...

510
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:43,039
- of your leaving.
- What a coincidence, Ma’am.

511
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:47,033
I too would like to take us all
for a meal.

512
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:49,819
Like a viral party or something.

513
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:51,539
It's farewell party, Net.

514
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:53,000
I’m always wrong.

515
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:55,148
- No, I’m sorry.
- I’m about to leave here.

516
00:29:55,189 --> 00:29:58,079
- You were right the first time.
- Viral party, right?

517
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:00,199
- Yes, that’s right.
- Not farewell?

518
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:02,240
No, "viral" is right.

519
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:06,519
Why did you bring your stuffs here?
Such a hassle.

520
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:08,519
I’m on my way.

521
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:11,599
So I don’t have to go back and forth.
I won’t return.

522
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:14,759
Alright, just place your orders.
It's on me.

- Susi?
- Sushi.

00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:48,530
- With "sh".
- Oh, sushod?

534
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:53,519
Sushi is like... rice, rolled with...

Oh, it’s nothing.

So why did you pack all those suitcases?

595

I planned to go mountain climbing,
but it’s raining.

229
00:09:45,291 --> 00:09:47,083
[tires squeal]

230
00:09:47,166 --> 00:09:52,000
Man, this is so fucking cool.
Way better than Uber. Good idea.

231
00:09:52,083 --> 00:09:54,500
Whoa, what the fuck are you doing there,
marshmallow tits?

232
00:09:54,583 --> 00:09:57,541
What? I thought the point of Duber
was you could smoke dope.

233
00:09:57,625 --> 00:09:58,666
Yeah, my dope.

234
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:00,416
-[brakes squeal]
-It's not fucking BYOD there,

235
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:01,333
Dumb-dy Dumb-ty.

236
00:10:04,833 --> 00:10:06,666
Oh, my God, this is really shitty.

237
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:09,625
Do you think I want my car
smelling like shitty fucking arcade dope?

238
00:10:10,083 --> 00:10:12,000
Here. This is free with your ride.

239
00:10:12,083 --> 00:10:13,125
[inhales]

240
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:18,291
How's that taste?

241
00:10:18,375 --> 00:10:21,750
Pretty smooth. Not sure if I got anything
off that or not.

242
00:10:21,833 --> 00:10:23,583
[scoffs] Yeah you did, trust me.

243
00:10:23,666 --> 00:10:26,208
When that kicks in, you're gonna be fucked
for four or five hours.

244
00:10:26,291 --> 00:10:27,125
Seriously?

245
00:10:27,583 --> 00:10:30,458
[inhales deeply]

246
00:10:30,541 --> 00:10:32,666
Bud, I'm telling you, take small tokes.

247
00:10:33,083 --> 00:10:34,250
You're gonna be fucked.

248
00:10:35,625 --> 00:10:36,625
Oh, my fuck.

249
00:10:37,208 --> 00:10:38,583
What the fuck is happening?

250
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,583
My chest is beating out of my chest.

251
00:10:41,666 --> 00:10:44,541
My heart is beating-- my fucking--
My heart is beating like a--

252
00:10:44,625 --> 00:10:45,625
Fuck-- Clock, man!

253
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:48,166
Fucking, what the-- Is this crack?

254
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:50,958
No, man, it's just good weed.
My fucking weed.

255
00:10:51,041 --> 00:10:52,875
Isn't it cool?
Fuck, I love being that high.

256
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:53,875
I'm so jealous.

257
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,791
Going to the muffler shop?
That's what it says.

258
00:10:55,875 --> 00:10:59,291
I can't even remember
why I was going there, man. I don't know.

259
00:10:59,375 --> 00:11:02,166
The muffler shop? What the fuck, man?

260
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:05,541
I think I might be fucking dying.
Take me to the hospital!

265
00:11:16,666 --> 00:11:18,625
Holy Christ, this is boring.

266
00:11:18,708 --> 00:11:20,583
I mean, is this the best
we could come up with?

267
00:11:20,666 --> 00:11:23,333
-I'm Steve Rogers, for fuck's sakes.
-[tires squealing]

268
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:25,500
[Ricky] Hurry up, you fucking pussy.

269
00:11:25,583 --> 00:11:26,791
Please, help me!

270
00:11:26,875 --> 00:11:29,291
So high. I think I'm gonna die, man.

271
00:11:29,666 --> 00:11:30,625
Roll camera.

272
00:11:31,125 --> 00:11:33,291
{\an8}<i>Steve Rogers here, live at the hospital.</i>

273
00:11:33,375 --> 00:11:35,041
{\an8}<i>Sir, can you tell me your name?</i>

274
00:11:35,125 --> 00:11:36,833
{\an8}<i>My name? No.</i>

275
00:11:36,916 --> 00:11:39,291
{\an8}<i>What's going on? Are you on drugs?</i>

276
00:11:39,375 --> 00:11:41,333
{\an8}<i>I just used this car service.</i>

277
00:11:41,416 --> 00:11:44,750
{\an8}<i>The driver gave me a joint,</i>
<i>I smoked it, and I am fucked!</i>

278
00:11:44,833 --> 00:11:45,666

{\an8}<i>Oh, it's Ricky</i>

281
00:11:50,916 --> 00:11:54,000
{\an8}<i>Ricky, I'd like to ask you a few questions</i>
<i>about Duber.</i>

282
00:11:54,083 --> 00:11:58,208
<i>Well, it's pretty simple really. It's like</i>
<i>Uber, but you can smoke weed in the car.</i>

283
00:11:58,291 --> 00:12:01,291
{\an8}<i>Weed's included for free,</i>
<i>and that way, it's all legal.</i>

284
00:12:01,791 --> 00:12:02,875
{\an8}<i>Interesting.</i>

285
00:12:03,333 --> 00:12:06,208
{\an8}[long drag] <i>Oh, that's nice stuff.</i>

286

{\an8}<i>Potent, too.</i>

287
00:12:07,875 --> 00:12:11,916
{\an8}<i>Well, folks, I have to say,</i>
<i>Steve Rogers is down with Duber.</i>

288
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,416
{\an8}<i>I'm Steve Rogers.</i>

289
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:17,875
Holy shit, Grampy's on TV. Cool!

290
00:12:18,541 --> 00:12:21,500
Holy mother of Mary's
silver-dollar nipples.

291
00:12:21,583 --> 00:12:24,583
We got calls coming in
all over the fucking place here, boys.

292
00:12:25,458 --> 00:12:29,166
Ricky, call at the grocery store,
then head back to the mall, ASAP.

293
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:32,291
<i>I can't now, man. I got Steve Rogers</i>
<i>in the back seat doing a story.</i>

294
00:12:32,375 --> 00:12:35,208
<i>It's awesome, man. He is fucking stoned.</i>

295
00:12:35,291 --> 00:12:40,041
{\an8}<i>I'm telling you, folks, Duber's a hit</i>
<i>in this award-winning journalist's eyes.</i>

296
00:12:40,125 --> 00:12:41,208
{\an8}<i>I don't even know...</i>

297
00:12:41,291 --> 00:12:44,125
{\an8}[laughs] <i>I don't even know</i>

298

{\an8}<i>I'm Steve "Not Making Any Sense" Rogers.</i>

301
00:12:54,291 --> 00:12:56,541
Right on, Ricky. Free marketing, buddy.

302
00:12:57,083 --> 00:12:59,125
<i>Yeah, all my idea, too.</i>

303
00:12:59,208 --> 00:13:02,708
Goddammit, this is getting out of control.
We're not ready for this.

304
00:13:02,791 --> 00:13:04,750
We don't have the infrastructure yet,
Ricky.

305
00:13:04,833 --> 00:13:06,958
You just fucked us right in the piss hole.

306
00:13:07,041 --> 00:13:09,166
Bubs, would you relax?
This is fucking amazing.

307
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:10,916
Ricky, brilliant thinking, buddy.

308
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,750
Now, tell Steve Rogers
just to let people know

309
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:14,916
that we need more drivers ASAP.

310
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,666
Tell them to come
to Sunnyvale Trailer Park.

311
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:20,750
I'm supposed to be in charge here, Julian,
and I say we can't hire anyone yet.

312
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:22,333
-We're not fucking ready!
-No, Bubs.

313
00:13:22,416 --> 00:13:24,833
Listen, you're totally in charge,
but I'm the manager here,

314
00:13:24,916 --> 00:13:26,291
so let me manage, okay?

315
00:13:26,375 --> 00:13:28,083
While you run this fucking thing.

316
00:13:28,166 --> 00:13:29,000
Fuck, man.

317
00:13:29,083 --> 00:13:32,166
That doesn't even make sense.
You're trying to double-talk me.

-[hip hop beat]
-[car squeaking]

319
00:13:34,125 --> 00:13:37,416
Somebody, show me
how this goddamn thing works!

320
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:42,125
It's about to drop my fucking uterus
right into my underwear.

321
00:13:42,208 --> 00:13:44,666
T, can you shut that thing down for her,
please?

322
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:47,291
Okay, thank you.
All right, listen up, everyone.

323
00:13:47,375 --> 00:13:50,791
Once you have a fucking sign on your car,
grab a walkie,

324
00:13:50,875 --> 00:13:53,708
get your pre-rolled joints,
and then spread out around the city.

325
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:56,458
Julian, what in the fuck
do you think you're doing?

326
00:13:56,541 --> 00:13:59,708
These cars need to be sealed
and equipped the same way as Ricky's.

327
00:13:59,791 --> 00:14:01,833
These drivers are gonna be high
as fucking kites.

328
00:14:01,916 --> 00:14:05,166
But we need to make money first
so we can fucking do all that shit.

329
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:06,250
Okay, ten joints each.

330
00:14:06,333 --> 00:14:09,916
That's 50 dollars you owe us,
plus the 25 percent of each fare.

331
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,083
All right, people, let's get out there.
Move. Let's go.

332
00:14:12,166 --> 00:14:15,500
This is fucking bullshit. We're getting in
over our heads here as usual.

333
00:14:15,583 --> 00:14:18,791
It's all good, buddy. We'll reinvest
everything we make back into the cars

334
00:14:18,875 --> 00:14:21,416
and make it right. See, this is success.

335
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:23,333
[engines starting]

336
00:14:23,416 --> 00:14:24,541
[brakes squealing]

337
00:14:24,625 --> 00:14:27,541
What the frig is up with all these cars
logjammed up here?

338
00:14:28,625 --> 00:14:30,875
M-m. Not on my frigging watch.

339
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,125
What's this, boys?

340
00:14:33,208 --> 00:14:35,166
Selling pre-rolled joints, are ya?

341
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:36,666
I don't think that's legal.

342
00:14:37,083 --> 00:14:38,583
Maybe Mr. Lahey was right.

343
00:14:38,791 --> 00:14:40,041
See? Told you, Randy.

344
00:14:40,125 --> 00:14:41,750
[screams] Mr. Lahey!

345
00:14:42,125 --> 00:14:43,291
You scared me again.

346
00:14:43,375 --> 00:14:45,666
-Randy, you gotta get the cops.
-I don't know, sir.

347
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:48,625
I don't want to rock the shit boat.
I've been getting along with the guys.

348
00:14:48,708 --> 00:14:50,125
They're breaking the law.

349
00:14:53,125 --> 00:14:54,708
What the frig is "Duber"?

350
00:14:55,208 --> 00:14:58,916
[Bubbles] Julian, we're completely fucked.
I told you this was gonna happen.

351
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,875
We don't have enough cars
to keep up with demand.

352
00:15:00,958 --> 00:15:03,375
This whole system,
it could crash at any minute.

353
00:15:03,458 --> 00:15:05,833
No, it can't.
Calm down, you can handle this.

354
00:15:05,916 --> 00:15:08,250
This is a positive thing,
not a negative thing.

355
00:15:08,333 --> 00:15:10,333
Think of the money
we're fucking making right now.

356
00:15:10,416 --> 00:15:13,375
Julian, there's a guy with a horse
and a buggy that wants to drive.

357
00:15:13,458 --> 00:15:15,500
-Is that cool?
-Definitely, the more the merrier.

358
00:15:15,583 --> 00:15:19,250
Sarah, ask him if he's got any friends
with any cows, or horses, or anything else

359
00:15:19,333 --> 00:15:21,750
that can pull fucking customers around
in a cart.

360
00:15:21,833 --> 00:15:23,875
What in the fuck are you talking about?

361
00:15:23,958 --> 00:15:27,375
How do you suppose I hook a GPS up
to a fucking horse?

362
00:15:27,458 --> 00:15:30,583
-What? Do I strap it to his wiener?
-Just get it done, Bubs.

363
00:15:34,541 --> 00:15:36,125
Ricky, thank fuck!

364
00:15:36,208 --> 00:15:38,291
Ricky, what the fuck happened
to your face?

365
00:15:38,375 --> 00:15:39,333
Boys, things are fucked.

366
00:15:39,416 --> 00:15:41,125
They're fighting to get a ride in my car.

367
00:15:41,208 --> 00:15:42,916
I got fucking punched,
I took a purse to the head

368
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,875
from some old crinkly, craggly bitch.

369
00:15:44,958 --> 00:15:46,458
I think she broke my fucking face bone.

370
00:15:46,541 --> 00:15:49,458
That sucks, bud, but I'm sure
it's just an isolated incident.

371
00:15:49,541 --> 00:15:51,416
We need some more fucking joints, Ricky.

372
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:52,708
We're out of joints already?

373
00:15:52,791 --> 00:15:55,375
Yes, man,
we're fucking kicking ass here, bud.

374
00:15:55,458 --> 00:15:56,583
<i>Yo, Bubbs, it's T.</i>

375
00:15:57,208 --> 00:16:00,333
<i>Yo, we got a major situation</i>
<i>down here at the Pizza Corner, man.</i>

376
00:16:00,416 --> 00:16:02,791
<i>Fuck, man, I'm scared, man.</i>
<i>We need fucking help down here.</i>

377
00:16:02,875 --> 00:16:03,708
<i>It's fucked, man.</i>

378
00:16:03,791 --> 00:16:04,666
Bubbs!

379
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:07,541
Man, please, you got to send more cars
down here. I need help.

380
00:16:07,625 --> 00:16:09,583
-We wanna get high!
-These motherfuckers are crazy!

381
00:16:09,666 --> 00:16:12,375
Fuck, man!
I think a motherfucker just broke my nose.

382
00:16:12,458 --> 00:16:14,375
You got to send more help.
Where are the guys at?

383
00:16:14,458 --> 00:16:17,750
All right, I need anyone that's free
to head to the Pizza Corner right now.

384
00:16:17,833 --> 00:16:20,333
[woman] <i>Fuck that!</i>
<i>People are losing their freaking minds.</i>

385
00:16:20,416 --> 00:16:23,708
<i>Some guy just pulled a fucking gun on me.</i>
<i>I quit!</i>

386
00:16:23,791 --> 00:16:25,833
Calm down, Marguerite.
It's because we're new.

387
00:16:25,916 --> 00:16:27,250
This will all settle down.

-Chill out, man.
-Now, I told you

if ever you were back here again
for selling marijuana,

456
00:19:04,208 --> 00:19:05,416
we would have a problem.

For my family.

473
00:19:47,833 --> 00:19:50,791

I mean, I thought this was legal.

The new dope laws are fucking confusing.
I mean, it's legal,

475

but yet it's not really legal.
It's fucked!

476
00:19:55,875 --> 00:19:57,791
And I'm not that smart to begun with,
so you know.

477
00:19:58,166 --> 00:20:00,708
Well, okay, look,
after hearing your testimony,

478
00:20:00,791 --> 00:20:03,750
I'm gonna reconsider my decision
in this case.

479
00:20:03,833 --> 00:20:07,166
Now, I sentence the drivers
to community service.

480
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:09,291
Community service? That ain't shit.

481
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:13,791
Now, as for you, Ricky and Julian,
I was gonna sentence you to 18 months.

482
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:17,000
But after hearing your moving testimony,

483
00:20:17,875 --> 00:20:20,291
I'm going to reduce that to 12 months.

484
00:20:21,625 --> 00:20:23,416
Remove them from my courtroom.

485

to call its first witness, Bubbles.

please.

-What?

29
00:01:19,875 --> 00:01:21,083
How much do you have into this?

30
00:01:21,708 --> 00:01:25,291
Oh, just… my life savings
plus a little loan I took out.

31
00:01:25,375 --> 00:01:26,500
-Fuck.
-Christ, Bubs.

32
00:01:26,625 --> 00:01:29,208
Boys, Fuzz Aldrin's is a home run,
I'm telling you.

33
00:01:29,291 --> 00:01:32,666
Bubs, man, launching a business
isn't an easy thing to fucking do.

34
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:34,250
Why didn't you come to me for advice?

35
00:01:34,333 --> 00:01:37,208
'Cause I know what your advice would be,
and you can shove that advice

36
00:01:37,291 --> 00:01:39,333
-right in the eye of your cock!
-Come on, man.

37
00:01:39,416 --> 00:01:41,833
Julian, this is my dream,
and I believe in this thing.

38
00:01:41,916 --> 00:01:44,416
I fucking slaved over the formula
to get it just right,

39
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:46,166
-and my kitties love it.
-Okay, all right.

40
00:01:46,583 --> 00:01:49,291
I managed to get myself
a meeting with the Petco chain,

41
00:01:49,375 --> 00:01:51,666
-I applied to the Dragons Tank TV show.
-Okay, Bubs.

42
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:53,833
-I don't need your--
-All right, okay, calm down.

43
00:01:53,916 --> 00:01:55,583
-I can do this on my own!
-Bubs, we don't--

44
00:01:55,666 --> 00:01:57,791
We just don't want to see you lose
all your money.

45
00:01:57,875 --> 00:02:00,250
Yeah, we just don't want you
to fuck up like you normally do.

46
00:02:00,333 --> 00:02:04,250
-Oh, I normally fuck up my stuff, do I?
-Ricky, what did you say that for?

47
00:02:04,333 --> 00:02:06,291
You two normally fuck up my stuff.

48
00:02:06,375 --> 00:02:08,708
That's what normally happens,
if you wanna get technical!

49
00:02:08,791 --> 00:02:11,833
-Bubs, that's not what he's trying to say.
-Well, you know what?

50
00:02:11,916 --> 00:02:15,000
You know what? Both of you,
get the fuck out of my shed, right now.

51
00:02:15,083 --> 00:02:16,833
Holy fuck.
Sorry, I didn't mean to get you all

52
00:02:16,916 --> 00:02:18,541
-fucking worked up.
-Well, you fucking did!

53
00:02:18,625 --> 00:02:21,041
-Holy fuck, I'm sorry, Bubs.
-[Bubbles sighs]

54
00:02:21,125 --> 00:02:23,708
-Though I didn't do anything.
-Thanks for loaning us your truck.

55
00:02:23,791 --> 00:02:24,875
-Appreciate it.
-What?

56
00:02:25,291 --> 00:02:27,791
-Listen, you two stupid cocksuckers.
-[engine fires]

57
00:02:27,875 --> 00:02:31,666
You're not taking my fucking truck again.
I need my truck today.

58
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:33,791
Fuck, Bubs,
it's just for a few hours, bud.

59
00:02:33,875 --> 00:02:35,708
I told you,
we need it to carry inventory.

60
00:02:35,791 --> 00:02:37,291
Holy fuck, talk about not listening.

61
00:02:37,375 --> 00:02:38,625
I listened to you, Ricky,

62
00:02:38,708 --> 00:02:41,083
and I fucking answered you,
as a matter of fact.

63
00:02:41,166 --> 00:02:43,291
I told you, you can't have it!

64
00:02:43,375 --> 00:02:45,958
Fuck, would you calm down?
Look, you can take my car.

65
00:02:46,041 --> 00:02:48,875
-I thought your damn car wouldn't start.
-It won't.

66
00:02:48,958 --> 00:02:51,875
But you just have to rebuild the starter
or the alternator. No big deal--

67
00:02:51,958 --> 00:02:55,333
I'm not rebuilding your goddamn fucking
ignition system for you, Ricky!

68
00:02:55,416 --> 00:02:57,708
-Jesus Christ. Stop the truck.
-Suit yourself.

69
00:02:57,791 --> 00:03:00,458
[sighs] Look, Bubs,
because it's your big day and everything,

70
00:03:00,541 --> 00:03:02,291
I'll let you take the Monte Carlo,
alright?

71
00:03:02,375 --> 00:03:06,250
-I don't want the Monte Car--
-Just take the fucking keys! C'mon!

72
00:03:06,333 --> 00:03:08,458
And put 20 bucks in the tank,
we'll call it even.

73
00:03:08,541 --> 00:03:11,791
-Oh, put 20 bucks in the tank!
-It burns a lot of gas, Bubs!

74
00:03:11,875 --> 00:03:13,125
So, you're taking my truck

75
00:03:13,208 --> 00:03:14,875
'cause you need it
for your grease business,

76
00:03:14,958 --> 00:03:18,708
but I have to put 20 dollars
in your look-at-me-I'm-Knight-Rider

77
00:03:18,791 --> 00:03:19,833
fucking muscle mobile!

78
00:03:19,916 --> 00:03:22,791
How are we supposed to pick up inventory
without your truck? It's Monday.

79
00:03:22,875 --> 00:03:24,708
Ricky, you put that fucking thing
back in gear,

80
00:03:24,791 --> 00:03:27,041
and I'm gonna fucking clobber you,
I'm warning you!

81
00:03:27,125 --> 00:03:28,833
-Have a good day, man.
-Yeah, bud.

-[Bubbles whimpers]

84
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:33,458
Unbelievable!

85
00:03:34,041 --> 00:03:36,541
Every fucking time
I try to do something legit,

86
00:03:36,625 --> 00:03:40,083
I have to go up against Butch Ass-idy
and the Muscle-Dance Kid!

87
00:03:40,166 --> 00:03:41,541
Cocksucker!

88

90
00:03:51,458 --> 00:03:54,208
God, see?
Cocksucker knows just where to go, too.

91
00:03:54,291 --> 00:03:57,333
You think you're smarter than me, huh?
You're not! You're not smarter than me.

92
00:03:57,416 --> 00:03:58,958
Ricky, what-- Calm the fuck down!

93
00:03:59,416 --> 00:04:01,916
It's an ice-cream cone.
It's not trying to beat you.

94
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,500
It thinks it's fucking better than me!

95
00:04:03,583 --> 00:04:05,750
-Don't you, you little piece of shit!
-It's not thinking.

96
00:04:05,833 --> 00:04:07,625
It's an ice-cream cone. It can't think.

97
00:04:07,708 --> 00:04:08,791
It's fucking pissing me off.

98
00:04:08,875 --> 00:04:10,833
-Stop talking to--
-Always trying to outsmart me.

99
00:04:10,916 --> 00:04:13,541
Ricky, it doesn't have a fucking brain,
you idiot!

100
00:04:13,625 --> 00:04:17,166
-What the fuck? Let go of the whee--
-[Julian] Fuck, stay in the lane.

101
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:18,250
-Fuck!
-[tires screech]

102
00:04:18,333 --> 00:04:20,541
-[people screaming]
-Oh, yeah. Fucking great.

103
00:04:20,625 --> 00:04:22,583
See? He made me blow a fucking tire.

104
00:04:22,666 --> 00:04:24,750
-Who did?
-The fucking asshole ice cream.

105
00:04:24,833 --> 00:04:27,958
-You fucking piece of shit.
-Ricky, would you get focused here?

106
00:04:28,041 --> 00:04:30,458
-Asshole.
-We've got the best business ever going,

107
00:04:30,541 --> 00:04:33,416
and you're gonna get us killed
trying to outsmart an ice-cream cone.

108
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:34,916
Look at him fucking looking at me.

109
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,416
-Looks like it can't fucking look at you.
-You fucking guess what, bud?

110
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:39,958
Fuck you! You're out of here!

111
00:04:40,041 --> 00:04:43,250
-[Ricky straining]
-This new business is fucking awesome.

112
00:04:43,333 --> 00:04:46,458
Getting into this, I didn't know shit
about online retail.

113
00:04:46,541 --> 00:04:48,750
But under this new business model
I came up with,

114
00:04:48,833 --> 00:04:50,375
-you can't run out of inventory.
-Fuck!

115
00:04:50,458 --> 00:04:53,166
-It's perfect.
-You fucking tit-milk whore!

116
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:55,833
Would you try to settle down?
I'm trying to talk here.

117
00:04:55,916 --> 00:04:59,458
It's hard work, but if you can put in
the time and pound the pavement,

118
00:04:59,541 --> 00:05:02,375
you can make a shit-ton of fucking money
selling this stuff.

119
00:05:02,458 --> 00:05:05,041
This new business may be the best thing
Julian's ever come up with.

120
00:05:05,125 --> 00:05:06,333
It was actually my idea

121
00:05:06,416 --> 00:05:09,666
and he just sort of trinkled it down
to what it is, but it's fucking amazing.

122
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:12,333
One of my life rules for success
has always been that I don't work,

123
00:05:12,416 --> 00:05:13,750
and this is definitely not work.

124
00:05:13,833 --> 00:05:16,708
How could something be fucking work
when it feels like Christmas every day?

125
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:19,583
All right, man, let's get working, buddy.

126
00:05:19,666 --> 00:05:21,250
Yeah, let's fucking do this!

[electronic voice] Can I help you?

129
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:42,833
[nervous laugh] Jesus, sorry,
just need you to sign for that right here.

130
00:05:43,333 --> 00:05:44,666
Thank you, young man.

131
00:05:45,208 --> 00:05:46,416
No problem.

132
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:48,250
Fuck off, you robot-talking fuck.

Jesus Christ,
will you stop trying to bite and fuck me,

136
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:57,833

There you go. Ten back to you, sugar-stick.

141
00:06:08,791 --> 00:06:09,708
Sugar-stick?

142
00:06:10,291 --> 00:06:11,458
[giggling] Thank you.

143
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:13,416

Whoa, fuck! Hang on, you can't take that!

147
00:06:23,125 --> 00:06:25,333
Sorry, kid. I'm just doing my job.

148
00:06:25,416 --> 00:06:26,875
But I've got a big meeting!

149

Son of a whore!

155
00:06:38,166 --> 00:06:40,125
-Where are you going?
-I wanna take a drive

156
00:06:40,208 --> 00:06:41,833
by that place in Colby Village again.

157
00:06:41,916 --> 00:06:45,125
We've hit that place four times
in the last two weeks, and they got a dog.

158
00:06:45,208 --> 00:06:48,541
-I don't wanna get fucked by another dog.
-You won't. Every time we go there,

159
00:06:48,625 --> 00:06:50,083
we get something awesome.

160
00:06:50,166 --> 00:06:52,583
And I wanna get something nice for Bubs
to chill him out.

161
00:06:52,666 --> 00:06:53,875
But you know what they say

162
00:06:53,958 --> 00:06:56,458
-when you try to rob wells too many times.
-No, what?

163
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:58,541
Rob a well once, shame on you.

164
00:06:58,625 --> 00:07:01,000
Rob a well twice,
shame on the fucking well.

165
00:07:01,083 --> 00:07:04,000
-Oh, my fuck, man.
-Yeah. Shame on the fucking well.

166
00:07:04,083 --> 00:07:05,625
Boom! Check it out.

-Oh, my God.
-These guys just keep ordering shit.

168
00:07:07,833 --> 00:07:09,625
[Ricky] Right on,
it must be something nice.

169
00:07:09,708 --> 00:07:11,250
It has a big, crazy f-word on the side!

170
00:07:11,333 --> 00:07:12,875
It's not a big, crazy word.

171
00:07:12,958 --> 00:07:14,708
-What does it say then?
-It's "fragile."

172
00:07:14,791 --> 00:07:16,166
-It's what?
-"Fragile"!

173
00:07:16,708 --> 00:07:19,541
-What does that mean?
-Fuck, just get the fuck out of the car.

174

[Bubbles] You can do this, Bubbles.

175
00:07:22,125 --> 00:07:24,750
Dab that blood off there,
and I should be fine.

All right, Bubbles, this is it.

00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,166
One little minor setback, but you're here.

178

You made it, and you are gonna nail it
because you are exceptional.

but I have an appointment to see--

183

He's gone, you missed it. Sorry.

184
00:07:44,916 --> 00:07:47,791
What? No, he's gonna wanna hear
about my Kitty Shakes.

You missed him, he's gone. Sorry.

[chugging, gasping]

191
00:08:02,416 --> 00:08:03,250
Fuck.

192
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:05,541
Dirty cocksuckers.

193
00:08:06,375 --> 00:08:07,625

-[engine approaching]

195
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:12,958
How'd the meeting go?

196
00:08:13,041 --> 00:08:14,750
You're drinking, must have went well.
Did it?

197
00:08:14,833 --> 00:08:17,041
Didn't even happen, actually, boys.

198
00:08:17,125 --> 00:08:20,333
You wanna take a slippery horse cock
of a fucking guess why?

199
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:21,250
What happened? And…

200
00:08:21,916 --> 00:08:22,750
where's my car?

201
00:08:22,833 --> 00:08:25,208
Well, 'cause you sent me off
in the fucking thing

202
00:08:25,291 --> 00:08:27,041
with 100 unpaid parking tickets,

203
00:08:27,125 --> 00:08:28,875
your car got impounded, Julian.

204
00:08:28,958 --> 00:08:31,916
I had to walk two fucking miles,
and I missed the guy

205
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,625
I was supposed to have the meeting with
in the first place!

206
00:08:34,708 --> 00:08:37,125
-Whoo-hoo, baby!
-Bubbles, Bubs.

207
00:08:37,208 --> 00:08:38,833
Where's the fucking Carlo?

208
00:08:38,916 --> 00:08:40,333
It's at the fucking impound

209
00:08:40,416 --> 00:08:42,916
with the rest of the criminal vehicles.

210
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,875
Oh, for fuck's sakes, are you kidding me?
Why'd you let them take it?

211
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:48,375
Oh, let's play a game, actually, Julian.

212
00:08:48,458 --> 00:08:50,625
Why don't you take a fiddler's fuck
of a guess

213
00:08:50,708 --> 00:08:54,916
what you can form a hydraulic seal around
with your big, muscular lips.

214
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,416
-Take a fucking guess!
-I'd guess cock, if I was you.

215
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,541
-He wants you to blow him, or--
-Would you shut up?

216
00:08:59,625 --> 00:09:03,000
Ding! That's right, Ricky.
Tell him what he wins!

217
00:09:03,083 --> 00:09:06,791
You win two beautiful nights
with your lips around…

218
00:09:06,875 --> 00:09:08,500
my cock, Julian!

219
00:09:08,583 --> 00:09:10,208
-Real nice.
-Calm down, it's all right.

220
00:09:10,291 --> 00:09:12,000
Yeah, look, so the-- We're sorry, Bubs.

221
00:09:12,083 --> 00:09:13,791
We appreciate you loaning the truck,
so look.

222
00:09:13,875 --> 00:09:17,000
-We got you something as a thank-you.
-Yeah, well, I don't fucking want it.

223
00:09:17,083 --> 00:09:19,708
That's fine. Don't open it
if you don't want to, but…

224
00:09:19,791 --> 00:09:20,708
just so you know,

225
00:09:20,791 --> 00:09:23,000
the last time we got a package
from that place last week,

226
00:09:23,083 --> 00:09:24,291
it was a fucking iPad.

227
00:09:24,375 --> 00:09:25,750
Yeah, and the time before that,

228
00:09:25,833 --> 00:09:28,375
we got a fucking RC helicopter,
the one I gave to Mo.

229
00:09:28,458 --> 00:09:29,708
Oh!

230
00:09:29,791 --> 00:09:32,500
Well, you can take
your fucking stolen iPad

231
00:09:32,583 --> 00:09:33,916
and your RC helicopter,

232
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,041
and you can drill it
right into your collective piss holes,

233
00:09:37,125 --> 00:09:39,500
'cause I don't want a fucking thing
to do with any of it.

234
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:41,000
Okay, then suit yourself, buddy.

235
00:09:41,083 --> 00:09:44,500
But, you know, I'll leave it right here,
just in case you change your mind.

236
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:47,958
[whimpering]

237
00:09:48,333 --> 00:09:52,625
[sighs] I don't want anything to do
with that stolen bullshit. Yup.

238
00:09:54,291 --> 00:09:56,583
Not the least bit interested, I'm not.

239
00:09:58,375 --> 00:09:59,791
Not one bit.

240
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:02,291
[blows raspberries] "Fragile."

241
00:10:02,375 --> 00:10:05,666
Yeah, just another way to say
"fucking built like shit."

242
00:10:06,416 --> 00:10:07,333
[sighs]

243
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:12,583
Wouldn't probably hurt to take
one little tiny peek inside, though.

244
00:10:13,208 --> 00:10:16,000
That's not really opening anything.
That's just looking.

245
00:10:16,541 --> 00:10:17,541
[quietly] Just looking.

246
00:10:17,625 --> 00:10:18,500
[door slams]

247
00:10:18,583 --> 00:10:20,166
[explosive boom]

248
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:22,500
[Bubbles] Fuck! Fucking fucker!

249
00:10:23,833 --> 00:10:27,875
Holy, sweet flying fuck! What happened?

250
00:10:28,333 --> 00:10:31,500
The package was a fucking glitter bomb,
that's what happened, Ricky.

251
00:10:31,583 --> 00:10:33,833
A glitter bomb?
Who the fuck would order a glitter bomb?

252
00:10:33,916 --> 00:10:36,291
They didn't fucking order it, dumbass!

253
00:10:36,375 --> 00:10:38,291
It was set as a trap, look at that!

254
00:10:38,375 --> 00:10:39,208
See that?

255
00:10:39,291 --> 00:10:42,958
This was a trap set by somebody
who was pissed off at someone else

256
00:10:43,041 --> 00:10:45,708
for repeatedly stealing
their fucking packages.

257
00:10:45,791 --> 00:10:47,708
Oh, figure that one out, boys.

258
00:10:48,166 --> 00:10:49,541
[crying] Oh, my God.

259
00:10:49,625 --> 00:10:51,625
Everything's ruined. Look at this.

260
00:10:51,708 --> 00:10:53,250
I officially give up!

261
00:10:53,333 --> 00:10:55,166
Oh, come on, buddy, it's not that bad.

262
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:56,750
Not that bad, Ricky?

263
00:10:56,833 --> 00:10:57,958
It looks like Liberace

264
00:10:58,041 --> 00:11:01,041
just jacked a big load
all over fucking everything I own.

265
00:11:01,125 --> 00:11:02,833
Hey, Bubbles, I have something for you.

266
00:11:02,916 --> 00:11:05,041
Fuck off, Randy.
Now is not a good time, bud.

267
00:11:05,125 --> 00:11:08,583
Wow, Bubbles,
I really like what you did with your shed.

268
00:11:08,666 --> 00:11:09,875
It's real pretty!

269
00:11:09,958 --> 00:11:12,208
How come you're dressed up like CP-103?

270
00:11:12,291 --> 00:11:13,958
What the fuck do you want, Randy?

271
00:11:14,041 --> 00:11:17,041
A letter came in for Bubbles
at the office. Special delivery.

272
00:11:17,875 --> 00:11:19,416
[sighs] Oh, my God, holy fuck.

273
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:21,666
You got accepted on Dragons Tank, buddy!

274
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:22,583
What?

275
00:11:22,666 --> 00:11:26,500
-Oh, well, that's just fucking great.
-Fucking right it is. That's awesome!

276
00:11:26,583 --> 00:11:29,583
I was being sarcastic, Ricky!
Look at all my stuff!

277
00:11:29,666 --> 00:11:30,500
Yeah?

the fucking logo on anymore,

'cause my two friends are arseholes
and destroyed my entire business.

[cries] Now give me a million dollars,
please!"

283
00:11:43,166 --> 00:11:46,708
-That ain't gonna fucking happen.
-Listen, we fucked this up on you,

284
00:11:46,791 --> 00:11:48,208
-but we'll make this right.
-Yeah.

285
00:11:48,291 --> 00:11:51,250
We can do this. Trust me, man.
I promise you, bud.

00:14:41,208 --> 00:14:42,958
Yeah, I think we've seen enough here.

356
00:14:43,041 --> 00:14:46,541
Oh, fuck off, dickhead.
Like you've never pissed yourself before!

357
00:14:46,625 --> 00:14:48,291
Okay, let's go, guys.

358
00:14:48,375 --> 00:14:49,625
No pissing on the set,

359
00:14:49,708 --> 00:14:51,875
and you can't tell the Dragons
to fuck off.

360
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:53,583
Well, I'm gonna ask them to suck my cock,

361
00:14:53,666 --> 00:14:56,375
lick my balls,
and finger my fucking asshole!

362
00:14:56,458 --> 00:14:58,708
-[theme music fades out]
-And blow me!

363
00:14:58,791 --> 00:15:00,958
Oh, my fuck, that was horrible!

364
00:15:01,041 --> 00:15:04,708
I pissed myself on the TV, boys!
I'm never gonna recover from that.

365
00:15:04,791 --> 00:15:07,708
Yes, you will.
I pissed myself on the TV lots of times.

366
00:15:07,791 --> 00:15:11,083
[laughs] Wow. Did you really just do that?

367
00:15:11,166 --> 00:15:12,708
Why don't you go fuck yourself?

368
00:15:13,166 --> 00:15:14,708
<i>Next into the </i>Dragon<i> </i>Tank,

369
00:15:14,791 --> 00:15:17,583
<i>an entrepreneur who claims</i>
<i>he's made an improvement…</i>

370
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:18,666
<i>to the wheel.</i>

371
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:21,666
This is how it's done, boys!
Watch and learn.

372
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:23,333
Nah, you know what? Fuck this.

373
00:15:23,416 --> 00:15:25,625
Bubs, go get yourself cleaned up.
I got this.

374
00:15:25,708 --> 00:15:26,583
Come on, Rick.

375
00:15:26,666 --> 00:15:27,916
Wait, what are you doing?

376
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,708
I'm making a fucking deal, Bubs,
that's what I'm doing.

377
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:32,875
Hello, Dragons!

378
00:15:32,958 --> 00:15:36,125
My name is Carl Hammersmith,
and I'm here--

379
00:15:36,208 --> 00:15:38,625
Sorry, Carl. You're done.
Get the fuck out of the way.

380
00:15:38,708 --> 00:15:41,750
-I'm sorry?
-You heard me, nipple tits. Fuck off.

381
00:15:41,833 --> 00:15:44,125
-Whoa, guys. What are you doing?
-What the fuck?

382
00:15:44,208 --> 00:15:46,375
You guys can't just come back out here.
Get out of here!

383
00:15:46,458 --> 00:15:47,750
Just listen up, please, sir.

384
00:15:47,833 --> 00:15:49,791
I apologize for what happened in here
a minute ago,

385
00:15:49,875 --> 00:15:51,291
but our friend gets a bit nervous.

386
00:15:51,375 --> 00:15:53,416
But we didn't get a chance
to finish our pitch.

387
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:56,375
So everyone's aware, Carl tried to grab
my cock and balls backstage.

388
00:15:56,458 --> 00:16:00,291
We apologize. Listen,
what do you guys have for us this time?

389
00:16:00,375 --> 00:16:01,500
Just let me do the talking.

390
00:16:02,041 --> 00:16:04,500
Hi, my name is Julian,
this is my associate Ricky,

391
00:16:04,583 --> 00:16:08,166
and we're seeking $5 million
for a 10 percent stake in our company,

392
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:10,041
-Muscle Rum.
-What are you talking about?

393
00:16:10,125 --> 00:16:11,375
[whispers] Just shut up.

394
00:16:11,458 --> 00:16:13,666
Now, I can tell
you guys like to work out a lot,

395
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:16,083
and if you're like me,
you like to have eight to ten drinks,

396
00:16:16,166 --> 00:16:18,625
but don't want to interfere
with your workout schedule.

397
00:16:18,708 --> 00:16:20,333
[lowers voice] Hand these out, please.

398
00:16:20,916 --> 00:16:23,208
With 40 grams of protein per bottle,

399
00:16:23,291 --> 00:16:27,250
you can get the protein you need
without sacrificing your alcohol intake.

400
00:16:27,333 --> 00:16:28,833
It's a win-win situation.

401
00:16:28,916 --> 00:16:31,166
-It's actually pretty good.
-Here's where I'm at.

402
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:34,000
First off, most people
don't have six to ten drinks a day.

403
00:16:34,083 --> 00:16:35,416
Oh, fuck, I do.

404
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:36,666
There's a shocker.

405
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:39,333
The thing is, you guys,
most people who are trying to get in shape

406
00:16:39,416 --> 00:16:40,708
don't drink at all.

407
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:43,916
I think this idea is completely bananas.
I'm out.

408
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,208
There's not even any banana in it,
you fucking dummy.

409
00:16:46,291 --> 00:16:47,208
It's a "coke-na-nut."

410
00:16:47,291 --> 00:16:49,166
-Would you stop your swearing?
-What swearing?

411
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:53,541
Let me get this straight. You're asking
for $5 million for 10 percent.

412
00:16:53,625 --> 00:16:57,125
That means you're valuing the company
at 50 million smackeroos.

413
00:16:57,208 --> 00:16:58,291
Do you have any sales?

414
00:16:58,375 --> 00:17:01,416
Uh, well, nothing yet, at the moment.

415
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:04,666
But it's gonna fly off the shelves.
Just trust me on this one.

416
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:06,166
Where you gonna sell this crap?

417
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:07,166
Out of my trailer.

418
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:08,250
Out of my trailer?

419
00:17:08,333 --> 00:17:10,916
I don't invest in anything
with an expiration date.

420
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:11,958
I'm out.

421
00:17:12,041 --> 00:17:15,291
Look, guys, you have an insane valuation.
You got no sales, no proof.

422
00:17:15,375 --> 00:17:18,875
Are you kidding me? Ten proof?
That's not a drink, that's not alcohol.

423
00:17:18,958 --> 00:17:20,500
And for those reasons, I'm out.

424
00:17:20,583 --> 00:17:22,291
I guess you don't have a patent on it.

425
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:25,000
You can pat it if you want,
but… it mixes better if you shake it.

426
00:17:25,083 --> 00:17:28,125
Wow, you could be the stupidest person
who's ever been on this show.

427
00:17:28,208 --> 00:17:29,291
Know that? You're an idiot.

428
00:17:29,375 --> 00:17:32,291
Oh, yeah? Why don't you lick
my smoothly-shaven bag

429
00:17:32,375 --> 00:17:35,041
from my taint to my tip,
you bald, rich fuck!

430
00:17:35,125 --> 00:17:39,416
This is quite possibly the worst pitch
that's ever happened on the show.

431
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:42,000
You're gonna get crushed
like the cockroaches you are.

432
00:17:42,083 --> 00:17:44,458
What the fuck did you just call me?

433
00:17:44,541 --> 00:17:46,625
A roach that crawls on someone's cock?

434
00:17:46,708 --> 00:17:49,541
-What are you gonna do, hit me?
-Yeah, actually, I am!

435
00:17:49,625 --> 00:17:51,333
-[loud thud]
-Boom! Fuck you!

436
00:17:51,416 --> 00:17:52,666
[grunting]

437
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:53,875
-Dicks!
-[grunts]

438
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,333
-[man] Fuck!
-Jesus H. Christ,

439
00:17:55,416 --> 00:17:56,916
what the fuck are you guys doing?

440
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,375
They fucking started it, Bubbles.

441
00:17:58,458 --> 00:17:59,875
That's bullshit. Your friend here--

442
00:17:59,958 --> 00:18:01,541
He's not my friend, actually.

443
00:18:01,625 --> 00:18:02,916
He's one of two people

444
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,583
who are constantly fucking up
everything I try to do!

445
00:18:05,666 --> 00:18:08,625
All right, everybody just stop
and calm down.

446
00:18:08,708 --> 00:18:11,541
So, let me get this right.
You're not involved in Muscle Rum?

447
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,541
-[screams] In what? Muscle Rum?
-I was doing it for you. I swear to fuck.

448
00:18:15,625 --> 00:18:17,208
You were doing it for me?

449
00:18:17,291 --> 00:18:20,041
Look, man, I know Kitty Shakes
is your dream, and I just thought

450
00:18:20,125 --> 00:18:21,791
if I could make a deal with Muscle Rum,

451
00:18:21,875 --> 00:18:23,750
we could use the money
to get it going for you.

452
00:18:23,833 --> 00:18:25,666
Oh, yeah, right, do it for me.

453
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:28,750
Bubs, I'm serious. I was--
The money was going towards you, man.

454
00:18:28,833 --> 00:18:31,375
I'd never take fucking Kitty Shakes
from you, I swear to fuck.

455
00:18:31,458 --> 00:18:33,166
What exactly is Kitty Shakes?

456
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:34,583
I love the name.

457
00:18:34,666 --> 00:18:37,958
Kitty Shakes is a delicious
and nutritious protein beverage

458
00:18:38,041 --> 00:18:40,291
that promotes a healthy coat
and strong bones.

459
00:18:40,833 --> 00:18:43,916
[sighs] I love kitties
more than anything else on the planet,

460
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,291
and they really do love it.

461
00:18:45,416 --> 00:18:46,250
That's true.

462
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:48,250
-So, you've tested it, right?
-Yes, ma'am.

463
00:18:48,333 --> 00:18:52,625
I've tested on the 126 free-range kitties
that I look after,

464
00:18:52,708 --> 00:18:54,791
and I haven't had one single complaint.

465
00:18:54,875 --> 00:18:57,791
[laughing] You've got 126 cats?

466
00:18:57,875 --> 00:19:01,125
Uh, give or take a few
in either direction because…

467
00:19:01,208 --> 00:19:02,791
some of my kitties are nomadic.

468
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:05,500
That's really great
that you take care of so many animals.

469
00:19:05,583 --> 00:19:07,541
You really love cats that much?

470
00:19:07,625 --> 00:19:10,583
[sighs] I love cats
more than anything else on the planet.

471
00:19:10,666 --> 00:19:13,375
-[piano music]
-No matter what happens in your life,

472
00:19:13,458 --> 00:19:15,458
kitties are always there for you.

473
00:19:15,541 --> 00:19:17,125
They don't judge you or…

474
00:19:17,208 --> 00:19:18,916
call you names, or…

475
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,041
make fun of your glasses. They're just…

476
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:23,708
there to dole out the love
unconditionally,

477
00:19:23,791 --> 00:19:25,125
and that's what I do for them.

478
00:19:26,041 --> 00:19:29,083
And I think if everyone else
thought like a kitty does…

479
00:19:29,166 --> 00:19:31,375
the world would be a much better place.

480
00:19:31,458 --> 00:19:33,000
That was touching.

481
00:19:33,083 --> 00:19:37,041
You seem like such a very genuine person,
Bubbles. I'd like to make you an offer.

482
00:19:37,125 --> 00:19:39,041
-[gasps] You would?
-Here's the deal.

483
00:19:39,125 --> 00:19:41,833
I'm gonna give you
exactly what you have into the business,

484
00:19:41,916 --> 00:19:42,791
but here's the catch:

485
00:19:42,875 --> 00:19:44,750
I want 50 percent equity in the company.

486
00:19:44,833 --> 00:19:46,208
Fifty percent? Well...

487
00:19:47,041 --> 00:19:49,500
-Yeah, you know what? Fifty percent, I--
-One more thing.

488
00:19:49,583 --> 00:19:52,458
You have to promise me
you're gonna cut ties with your partners

489
00:19:52,541 --> 00:19:54,000
completely and immediately.

490
00:19:54,083 --> 00:19:55,625
What? Cut ties?

491
00:19:56,041 --> 00:19:56,875
Like…

492
00:19:56,958 --> 00:19:58,833
don't talk to them anymore, cut ties?

493
00:19:58,916 --> 00:20:00,250
I gotta be straight with you,

494
00:20:00,333 --> 00:20:04,041
the business is never gonna succeed
with guys like this around you,

495
00:20:04,125 --> 00:20:07,458
or anywhere near you.
Sorry, no offense, you guys.

496
00:20:07,541 --> 00:20:11,583
I believe Kitty Shakes
could make you a millionaire very quickly.

497
00:20:11,666 --> 00:20:13,291
But that's only gonna happen

498
00:20:13,375 --> 00:20:15,375
if you stay away
from these two ding-dongs.

499
00:20:15,458 --> 00:20:16,583
Or I'm just not interested.

500
00:20:16,666 --> 00:20:19,541
Cut ties with my best friends
to be a millionaire?

501
00:20:19,625 --> 00:20:21,000
Those are your best friends?

502
00:20:21,083 --> 00:20:24,708
Come on, this is a no-brainer.
And so are they. Idiots.

503
00:20:24,791 --> 00:20:26,625
You got an offer.
What are you going to do?

504
00:20:26,708 --> 00:20:27,583
Well...

505
00:20:28,291 --> 00:20:29,458
this is a no-brainer.

506
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:33,833
So, I'd like to…
politely decline your offer, ma'am.

507
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:37,666
Look, I know these two
fuck up a lot, like…

508
00:20:38,166 --> 00:20:40,250
-a lot, but...
-[piano music playing]

509
00:20:40,333 --> 00:20:42,625
they're my family,
and no amount of money in the world

510
00:20:42,708 --> 00:20:44,000
would be worth losing them over.

511
00:20:44,083 --> 00:20:47,000
Whoa, worst decision I've ever seen.

512
00:20:47,083 --> 00:20:49,541
Actually, that's what friends do,
right there.

513
00:20:49,625 --> 00:20:52,208
You're lucky to have that guy, fellas.
Well done!

514
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:54,583
-Love you, buddy.
-Yeah, man, me too.

515
00:20:55,375 --> 00:20:56,833
Love you guys, too.

516
00:20:56,916 --> 00:20:58,708
We'll get Kitty Shakes going,
don't you worry.

517
00:20:58,791 --> 00:21:00,250
We don't need anybody's help.

518
00:21:00,875 --> 00:21:01,958
I know, Julian.

519
00:21:02,833 --> 00:21:04,791

some chicken pizzas, booze, and dope,

It's never gonna happen.
It's been 20 fucking years. Fuck off.

118
00:04:42,583 --> 00:04:44,541
Ricky, yo.
Did you say you got weed, motherfucker?

119
00:04:44,958 --> 00:04:45,916
Yeah, I do have weed.

120
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,333
Do you know where I can get
non-bitey animals that kids like?

121
00:04:48,833 --> 00:04:50,625
Did you say animals, cracker?

122
00:04:50,708 --> 00:04:53,833
Get it, boys, you get it?
Animal the cracker? Animal cracker.

123
00:04:53,916 --> 00:04:55,916
Nah, that shit was weak.
What's wrong with you?

124
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,208
You stupid-ass motherfucking cracker.

125
00:04:58,291 --> 00:05:01,041
Shut the fuck up, man.
Go wait in the car and roll some joints.

126
00:05:01,125 --> 00:05:02,166
Boys, here's the deal.

127
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:05,250
You guys get me some fucking animals
for a petty-zooey-type thing,

128
00:05:05,333 --> 00:05:07,458
and my last bag of OG Kush,
it's fucking yours.

129
00:05:07,541 --> 00:05:10,500
Fuck, word. On it like chronic, homeboy.
[sniffs]

130
00:05:10,583 --> 00:05:13,291
But, Rick, are you fucking washing
your clothes in the fucking toilet?

131
00:05:13,375 --> 00:05:14,500
You fucking smell like piss, man.

132
00:05:14,583 --> 00:05:16,375
Yeah, your old lady pissed on me.
That's why.

133
00:05:16,791 --> 00:05:18,750
All right, boys,
shit's coming together here.

134
00:05:18,833 --> 00:05:21,375
Let's go talk to this clown.
See if the fucker can help us out.

135
00:05:25,125 --> 00:05:27,333
{\an8}Okay, get in the car,
you weird-looking fuck.

136
00:05:27,416 --> 00:05:29,625
{\an8}-What the fuck are you doing?
-I'm doing what I fucking need to.

137
00:05:29,708 --> 00:05:31,750
{\an8}I don't have any money
or fucking weed left. We're taking him.

138
00:05:31,833 --> 00:05:34,416
{\an8}Ricky, I have money, for Christ's sakes.

139
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,250
{\an8}Sorry about that, Mr. Clown, sir.

140
00:05:36,333 --> 00:05:39,333
{\an8}We're actually looking to hire you
for a kid's party for a couple hours.

141
00:05:39,416 --> 00:05:41,458
{\an8}Sorry, asshole. I don't do parties.

142
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:42,708
{\an8}I'm not really a clown.

143
00:05:42,791 --> 00:05:45,666
{\an8}The fuck do you mean?
Look, you got a fucking clown suit on,

144
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:47,916
big fucking shoes, stupid hair,
and a big red nose.

145
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,958
You're a fucking clown.
Get in the car now!

146
00:05:50,041 --> 00:05:53,541
I'm just a drunk who works for free liquor
and haircuts to steer customers--

147
00:05:53,625 --> 00:05:55,291
-Get in there!
-You're hurting me.

148
00:05:55,375 --> 00:05:57,833
Hey, what's going on here?
You're scaring away my customers.

149
00:05:57,916 --> 00:05:59,833
Frudy, just borrowing your clown
for a couple hours.

150
00:05:59,916 --> 00:06:03,375
Oh, the fuck you are. He's my clown.
Get your hands off him.

151
00:06:03,458 --> 00:06:06,416
You fucking calm down, Frudy.
I just need him for a little--

152
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,416
[screaming]

153
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:12,583
Fucking Moses' milky fucking tits!
I think I just blew my big toe off!

154
00:06:12,666 --> 00:06:15,083
Think you can give me a hand here, Julian?
Put the phone down!

155
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:17,375
Ricky, you gotta spin your faces around
to the camera.

156
00:06:17,458 --> 00:06:19,000
-I can't catch you.
-Put the fucking phone down!

157
00:06:19,083 --> 00:06:20,000
Turn that off.

158
00:06:20,083 --> 00:06:23,291
Look, I'll have 50 dollars for you
when we bring him back, Frudy.

159
00:06:23,375 --> 00:06:26,250
And I'm gonna get one of your seven-dollar
shampoo and cuts.

160
00:06:26,666 --> 00:06:29,333
Big tip, too. Please don't call the cops.

161
00:06:30,791 --> 00:06:31,625
Whoa.

162
00:06:32,333 --> 00:06:34,250
What the fuck is happening to me, dude?

163
00:06:34,333 --> 00:06:36,583
It's like the more we walk,
the more blue dots come out.

164
00:06:36,666 --> 00:06:39,916
I'm not a doctor, but I think
you're sweating out the paint you drank.

165
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:40,958
Oh, no way.

166
00:06:41,041 --> 00:06:42,208
Dude, that's kinda dope.

167
00:06:42,291 --> 00:06:43,916
Totally, man. You look like a leopard.

168
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,458
I mean, if it didn't have big teeth
and hair, and it had blue dots.

169
00:06:47,541 --> 00:06:49,208
What? [growls]

170
00:06:49,291 --> 00:06:51,208
Are you sure this guy's gonna trade food
for weed?

171
00:06:51,291 --> 00:06:53,541
Yeah, totally, dude.
I've seen Ricky trade weed,

172
00:06:53,625 --> 00:06:57,500
cough syrup, hockey cards, skin mags,
fresh corn on the cob,

173
00:06:57,583 --> 00:06:59,458
a tire, a park bench, man.

174
00:06:59,541 --> 00:07:00,958
This guy will trade anything

175
00:07:01,041 --> 00:07:03,458
for his hot dogs, dude.
Dude's name is The Dawgfather.

176
00:07:03,541 --> 00:07:06,125
I think he's like in the Mafia, dude,
and he loves me.

177
00:07:07,916 --> 00:07:10,375
Hey, Dawgfather. What's up, my brother?

178
00:07:10,875 --> 00:07:11,750
[coughs]

179
00:07:11,833 --> 00:07:13,750
How many dogs, you weird little fuck?

180
00:07:15,041 --> 00:07:17,041
-All of them?
-No can do, E.T.

181
00:07:17,125 --> 00:07:18,916
It's almost lunch rush. I have regulars.

182
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,375
Please, Mr. Dawg. It's like 911, dude.

183
00:07:21,458 --> 00:07:24,416
Yeah, they're for my son's birthday party.
We're getting a clown, too.

184
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:26,583
[sighs] Follow me, dickheads.

185
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:31,208
Well, I think this could be
our retirement, boys.

186
00:07:31,291 --> 00:07:34,208
Bubs, can you upload this fucking thing?
I can't figure it out.

187
00:07:34,291 --> 00:07:35,708
Julian, are you fucked?

188
00:07:35,791 --> 00:07:38,708
You want to upload a video
that clearly shows the three of us

189
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:40,875
kidnapping an alcoholic clown at gunpoint,
do you?

190
00:07:40,958 --> 00:07:41,791
Yeah, I do.

191
00:07:41,875 --> 00:07:44,166
Ricky, if you wanna be known
as the guy getting beat up

192
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:47,666
by a gay, Brazilian-jiujitsu
fucking hairdresser, you have at it, bud.

193
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:49,333
Just blur out the faces, then.

194
00:07:49,416 --> 00:07:52,750
Blur out the faces? Yeah, okay.
Yeah, actually, give me the phone.

195
00:07:52,833 --> 00:07:54,791
-Here, I'll blur out the fucking faces.
-Thank you.

196
00:07:54,875 --> 00:07:56,208
Delete. There you go.

197
00:07:56,291 --> 00:07:58,916
-She's fucking blurred now, baby.
-You didn't just delete that, Bubs.

198
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,541
What the fuck are you doing?

199
00:08:00,625 --> 00:08:03,166
Boys, we gotta wake up
this piss-drunk bastard.

200
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:04,333
Just shake him, then.

201
00:08:04,416 --> 00:08:06,458
-Motherfucker, he might be dead.
-[stomach gurgling]

202
00:08:06,541 --> 00:08:08,541
Jesus Christ. Did he just shit himself?

203
00:08:08,625 --> 00:08:09,666
Oh, baby.

204
00:08:10,166 --> 00:08:13,916
Oh, baby. Magic 8-Ball says,
"All signs point to yes."

205
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,708
-[gurgling continues]
-My... Oh, fuck. [coughs]

206
00:08:16,791 --> 00:08:20,791
Holy shit, clown's shit stinks.
I thought it smelled like cotton candy.

207
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:22,125
[rats squealing]

208
00:08:22,208 --> 00:08:24,166
Oh, these fucking rats.

209
00:08:26,458 --> 00:08:27,291
Here.

210
00:08:27,375 --> 00:08:29,291
Uh, those hot dogs look kinda weird.

211
00:08:29,375 --> 00:08:30,541
Are they okay to eat?

212
00:08:30,625 --> 00:08:34,166
These are real good Italian jumbos.
Kids love.

213
00:08:34,875 --> 00:08:37,458
I don't know, dude.
I fell in the snow once when I was a kid,

214
00:08:37,541 --> 00:08:39,416
and I pulled my fingers out,
and I had frostbite.

215
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:41,916
That's what these look like.
How long they been in there?

216
00:08:42,375 --> 00:08:44,666
Long time, so cook long time.

217
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:47,666
Okay. Thanks, Dawg.
You're a lifesaver, man.

218
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:50,458
-No Cold War here, boy.
-Put your fucking hand down,

219
00:08:50,541 --> 00:08:52,166
-or I cut it off.
-That's cool.

220
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:53,291
[upbeat music playing]

221
00:08:53,375 --> 00:08:57,000
All right, shorties, who wants to be first
to step up and pet the animals?

222
00:08:57,083 --> 00:08:59,250
[child] That gorilla isn't even real.

223
00:08:59,333 --> 00:09:01,250
Come on now. You know the zoo is dope.

224
00:09:01,333 --> 00:09:02,833
Man, they cool, man, they cool.

225
00:09:02,916 --> 00:09:04,666
I wanna pick up the frog.

226
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:08,416
Hi, birthday boy. How are you today?

227
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:10,750
Ew. Gross. That frog is dead.

228
00:09:10,833 --> 00:09:12,000
Oh, fuck, it is.

229
00:09:12,666 --> 00:09:14,375
Finch, what the fuck's wrong with you?

230
00:09:14,458 --> 00:09:17,125
Playing with dead frogs and shit.
No wonder your ass got warts.

231
00:09:17,208 --> 00:09:19,583
I think I've had enough of the animals,
Mommy.

232
00:09:19,666 --> 00:09:22,791
Okay. Who wants to play
pin the tail on the donkey?

233
00:09:22,875 --> 00:09:24,500
Your party sucks ass, Mo.

234
00:09:24,833 --> 00:09:26,125
Hey, fuck you.

235
00:09:26,416 --> 00:09:28,583
-Fight!
-[all chanting] Fight!

236
00:09:28,666 --> 00:09:31,375
-[boy] Choke him out!
-Mo, that's enough. Stop it.

237
00:09:33,291 --> 00:09:35,916
Grampy! I knew you wouldn't let us down.

238
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,625
Of course not, little buddy.
Check out the clown, kids.

239
00:09:38,708 --> 00:09:41,583
Just keep your distance.
He doesn't smell very "clowny" just yet.

240
00:09:41,666 --> 00:09:43,791
Oh, great entertainment for the kids,
Ricky.

241
00:09:43,875 --> 00:09:45,750
A clown that smells like booze and shit.

242
00:09:45,833 --> 00:09:48,166
He has a sock duct-taped in his mouth.
Classy.

243
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:49,541
It's better than what you fucking did.

244
00:09:49,625 --> 00:09:52,333
And it's all part of the act, Sarah.
So mind your own fucking business.

245
00:09:52,416 --> 00:09:55,375
Yo, what's up, dudes?
We got the birthday food.

246
00:09:55,458 --> 00:09:59,833
[vocalizing] Yeah.

247
00:09:59,916 --> 00:10:02,541
What in the fuck is all over you?
Did you get banged by a snurf?

248
00:10:02,625 --> 00:10:05,291
-I drank paint, dude, remember?
-Yeah, and he's sweating it out.

249
00:10:05,375 --> 00:10:08,458
-Epic.
-Whoa, that's insane.

250
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:12,500
Jumping Jesus on a pogo stick.
I've fucking seen it all now.

251
00:10:12,583 --> 00:10:14,666
[Mo] You're the bestest Grampy ever.

252
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:18,000
Thanks, little Mo-Mo.
Okay, kids. I need to get high,

253
00:10:18,083 --> 00:10:20,916
so I'm gonna do a few bottle tokes,
gonna get the clown to clean his shit pipe

254
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:21,833
and then it's party time!

255
00:10:21,916 --> 00:10:23,166
[kids cheering]

256
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:26,750
When I suggested getting a clown
from out front of Frudy's hair salon,

257
00:10:26,833 --> 00:10:29,166
I was thinking more
about helping a poor homeless fella out

258
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:30,125
with a couple bucks.

259
00:10:30,208 --> 00:10:33,416
Not kidnapping him
and literally scaring the shit out of him.

260
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,500
I mean, the party was going okay
for a bit, but…

261
00:10:35,583 --> 00:10:38,625
once Ricky forced the clown
to swallow 40-yards of rags

262
00:10:38,708 --> 00:10:42,208
and puke his goddamn guts up,
I mean, things went fucky.

263
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,750
Gross. Some went in my mouth.

264
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:49,208
Hey, what's up, birthday boy?

265
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:52,166
This party's starting to suck ass again,
Uncle Julian.

266
00:10:52,708 --> 00:10:53,625
Can you fix it?

267
00:10:53,708 --> 00:10:55,416
What? The party's not that bad.

268
00:10:55,875 --> 00:10:58,833
Oh, Jesus.
This is a fucking terrible existence.

269
00:10:58,916 --> 00:11:01,875
To hell with this! I'm outta here.
Shoot me if you wanna.

270
00:11:01,958 --> 00:11:03,125
-I don't give a fuck.
-[Ricky] Dick!

271
00:11:03,208 --> 00:11:05,000
-You're an alcoholic!
-You're garbage!

272
00:11:05,083 --> 00:11:06,416
-[boy] Have another drink.
-You suck.

273
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:07,708
-Lame.
-Don't worry, little buddy.

274
00:11:07,791 --> 00:11:09,666
I got your back.
Everything's gonna be okay.

275
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:12,083
Fucking Julian.
Always gotta be the big hero.

276
00:11:12,166 --> 00:11:15,416
-Cory, get the fuck over here right now.

-I've thought you were a dick, right?
-Yeah, dude.

What if there's a way to change that?
What if there's a way

280
00:11:22,208 --> 00:11:24,333
we could hang out together,
just you and me

For fuck's sake, hold my phone.

Hurry up. Get behind him and squeeze him.

and squeezing him. It'll turn him on.

or he's turning off. For good!

No, you gotta spoon him.
Get in there nice and close

and wrap them around him.

to the esophageal wall.

-Pumping motion?

-What the fuck are you talking about?
-You gotta fucking pump him!

He's getting hard.
Just so everyone's aware.

434
00:17:44,041 --> 00:17:45,166
What? Hard?

435
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:48,791
He's just getting a little hard, Julian.
Don't stop. We're losing him.

436
00:17:50,291 --> 00:17:53,416
Oh, my fuck. We need more pressure
on the center of the gut.

437
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:54,791
Bend him over the picnic table.

438
00:17:54,875 --> 00:17:57,375
Use the edge to focus more torque
on the belly.

Come on, Julian. Pump him hard.
You can fuck harder than that.

441
00:18:02,416 --> 00:18:05,875
Not enough surface area.
You gotta go belly to back on him, Julian.

442
00:18:05,958 --> 00:18:07,625
For fuck's sake, Bubbles!

443
00:18:07,708 --> 00:18:10,958
Grip the edge of the picnic table
and really fucking give it to him!

444
00:18:11,041 --> 00:18:12,375
Fucking hammer him!

445
00:18:12,666 --> 00:18:16,750
-[Julian grunting]
-[Randy gurgling]

446
00:18:16,833 --> 00:18:18,000
That's it, Julian.

447
00:18:18,666 --> 00:18:19,708
Teach him a lesson.

448
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:22,375
[coughs]

449
00:18:22,458 --> 00:18:24,583
-[kids cheering]
-[Bubbles] Oh, thank fuck!

450
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:26,333
You saved him.

451
00:18:26,875 --> 00:18:27,875
Holy frig.

452
00:18:28,333 --> 00:18:29,916
Did you see that, everybody?

453
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
You just saved my life, Julian.

454
00:18:34,125 --> 00:18:37,333
Sorry about that.
It just does that sometimes.

455
00:18:37,416 --> 00:18:38,916
[Bubbles] Jesus, he is hard.

456
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,708
You're my hero, Julian.

457
00:18:40,791 --> 00:18:44,083
Randy, get that fucking thing off my leg
right now, or I'll kill you myself.

458
00:18:44,166 --> 00:18:49,500
[all chanting] Julian.

459
00:18:49,958 --> 00:18:52,791
Here we go again.
The perfectly fucking glorious Julian

460
00:18:52,875 --> 00:18:56,125
saves the day and becomes a big superhero
to all the fucking land.

461
00:18:56,208 --> 00:18:58,625
Fuck, he pisses me off.
Oh well, as they say,

462
00:18:58,708 --> 00:19:01,208
success is a revenge.
So it's time to show everybody

463
00:19:01,291 --> 00:19:03,375
what kind of success
old Ricky boy's got in storage.

464
00:19:03,458 --> 00:19:07,458
Jesus shimmering turtle cocks, there.
Okay, I think I got it.

465
00:19:07,541 --> 00:19:08,791
Fire in the fucking hole.

466
00:19:09,125 --> 00:19:10,000
[farts]

467
00:19:10,083 --> 00:19:13,000
[laughs] Just fucking with you there,
sheep shitter.

468
00:19:13,083 --> 00:19:15,583
-[Reggie] Here she goes.
-Right fucking on, Reg.

469
00:19:15,666 --> 00:19:16,708
[kid] This is lame.

470
00:19:16,791 --> 00:19:19,291
[Mo] Faster, Grampy, faster.
Come on, speed it up.

471
00:19:19,375 --> 00:19:21,458
I like how you're thinking, birthday boy.

472
00:19:21,541 --> 00:19:25,291
Be careful, Ricky. This thing doesn't have
a governor on it that I can see.

473
00:19:25,375 --> 00:19:29,958
Yeah, I stripped that off this thing
years ago to put it on an old golf cart.

474
00:19:30,041 --> 00:19:32,375
[Ricky] It's fine.
The kids wanna go faster.

475
00:19:32,458 --> 00:19:34,291
-[metal snaps]
-[Ricky screams] Oh fuck!

476
00:19:34,875 --> 00:19:36,125
[kid] Now we're talking.

477
00:19:36,208 --> 00:19:38,416
-[metal crunching]
-[kids screaming]

478
00:19:39,166 --> 00:19:40,000
[Ricky] Now what?

479
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,875
Dad, what are you doing? Turn it off.

480
00:19:44,666 --> 00:19:45,500
[engine winds down]

481
00:19:45,583 --> 00:19:47,000
Mo-Mo, does your arm hurt?

482
00:19:47,125 --> 00:19:49,875
Nope. Just my hand,
my wrist, and my elbow.

483
00:19:49,958 --> 00:19:50,958
Okay, everyone.

484
00:19:51,375 --> 00:19:53,750
That's it. The party is over.
Call your moms.

485
00:19:53,833 --> 00:19:56,125
What the fuck did you shut it down for,
Bubs?

486
00:19:56,208 --> 00:19:59,333
You didn't see the kids getting flung
six ways from fucking Sunday?

487
00:19:59,666 --> 00:20:01,500
Well, yeah, but I was getting gold, man.

488
00:20:02,541 --> 00:20:03,458
Erased.

489
00:20:03,541 --> 00:20:04,583
What the fuck?

490
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:09,083
Julian, greed has completely taken over
the common sense gene in your head, bud.

491
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:11,000
-What are you talking about?
-You know what?

492
00:20:11,083 --> 00:20:14,333
You just don't get it. I give up.
I don't give a fuck.

493
00:20:14,416 --> 00:20:18,166
You post whatever the fuck you want,
you big, greedy, muscly bastard.

494
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:20,583
Greedy? Who's fucking greedy?

495
00:20:20,666 --> 00:20:23,666
Everything I do, I do for all of us,
and you know it, man.

496
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:24,666
[Bubbles] Yeah.

497
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:30,291
How's that looking, Cory?
That looks like a pretty good match.

498
00:20:30,375 --> 00:20:33,000
I think you need to go
a couple shades blacker, dude.

499
00:20:33,083 --> 00:20:34,625
Like, Darth Vader black.

500
00:20:35,916 --> 00:20:37,416
Yeah, that's perfect, dude.

501
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:38,500
You wanted to talk to me?

502
00:20:39,375 --> 00:20:40,458
Just wanted to let you know

503
00:20:40,541 --> 00:20:42,416
that your viral video's catching on
as we speak.

504
00:20:42,833 --> 00:20:44,000
Uh, what video?

505
00:20:44,583 --> 00:20:45,750
What's it matter what video?

506
00:20:45,833 --> 00:20:48,125
As long as it's viral
and it's making money.

507
00:20:48,208 --> 00:20:49,875
Isn't that your rule, Julian?

508
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:51,125
Bubs, come on.

509
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:52,750
No. Anyway, I'm just…

510
00:20:52,833 --> 00:20:56,541
letting you know it's catching on
and cash will be rolling in pretty soon.

511
00:20:56,875 --> 00:20:59,291
What fucking video
are you talking about, Bubs?

512
00:21:00,208 --> 00:21:03,208
Yeah, don't act like
you don't fucking like this, Randy.

513
00:21:03,291 --> 00:21:05,791
You like big Julian coming aboard you.

514
00:21:05,875 --> 00:21:07,541
Bubs, what the fuck is this?

515
00:21:07,958 --> 00:21:13,125
"Muscular man saves overweight bisexual
wiener choker

516
00:21:13,208 --> 00:21:15,666
with sexual Heimlich thrust maneuver"?

517
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:17,166
Are you fucking kidding me?

518
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:20,166
I embellished the dialogue a tiny bit,
but look at the numbers.

519
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:22,416
I mean,
it's already made probably 40 bucks.

520
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:26,000
You gotta take this down, man.
What if the boys in jail see this, huh?

521
00:21:26,083 --> 00:21:29,125
Oh, you want me to take it down, do you?
Even though it could make money.

522
00:21:29,208 --> 00:21:31,000
Isn't that all that matters to you,
Julian?

523
00:21:31,083 --> 00:21:32,625
Just take it the fuck down.

524
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:34,583
Yeah, okay. I'll take it down, but…

525
00:21:34,666 --> 00:21:36,666
I'm taking it down
'cause you're my best friend

526
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:38,416
and I don't wanna embarrass you.

527
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:40,083
Jeez, I don't know, though, Julian.

528
00:21:40,166 --> 00:21:42,458
What if this thing goes viral,
right through the roof?

529
00:21:42,541 --> 00:21:45,250
Look at that.
It just jumped up another 1,000 views.

530
00:21:45,333 --> 00:21:46,291
Just made more money.

531
00:21:46,375 --> 00:21:49,833
-I say we leave it up.
-Okay. You made your point here, okay?

532
00:21:49,916 --> 00:21:50,791
Look, I'm sorry.

533
00:21:50,875 --> 00:21:52,916
Friends are more important than money,
I get it.

534
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,500
Now just delete this fucking thing.

537
00:21:58,041 --> 00:22:00,750
Oh, my fuck. It's broken?

538
00:22:00,833 --> 00:22:03,000
Well, at least it's a clean break.

539
00:22:03,083 --> 00:22:05,000
Your grampy is a piece of shit.

540
00:22:05,083 --> 00:22:07,875
Mo, I feel like shit.
I'm so sorry, buddy. Fuck me.

541
00:22:07,958 --> 00:22:10,875
-You made today perfect, Grampy.
-What are you talking about?

542
00:22:11,333 --> 00:22:14,041
My friends said
it was the best party ever.

543
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:16,541
And the girls are gonna like my cast.

544
00:22:16,625 --> 00:22:18,875
Oh, actually, that's true.
Girls do like the cast.

545
00:22:18,958 --> 00:22:21,458
When I was a kid, I tried to jump off
the school roof skydiving,

546
00:22:21,541 --> 00:22:23,416
broke my legs. The fucking girls loved it.

547
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:26,000
Actually, I got banged that year.
How old are you now?

548
00:22:26,083 --> 00:22:28,500
He's not doing any banging yet, ew!

549
00:22:28,583 --> 00:22:29,833
Now, say good night to Grampy.

550
00:22:29,916 --> 00:22:32,833
I want you to be the first one to sign it,
Grampy.

551
00:22:33,375 --> 00:22:35,083
Fuck, I'd be honored, Gramson.

552
00:22:35,666 --> 00:22:38,083
Thanks for trying so hard today, Dad.

553
00:22:38,166 --> 00:22:40,125
You really are a good grandfather.

554
00:22:40,208 --> 00:22:42,208
Oh, I appreciate that, Trin. Thanks.

555
00:22:43,041 --> 00:22:44,541
Oh, my fuck. These are the good ones.

556
00:22:44,625 --> 00:22:46,791
You can get really fucked up
off these ones.

558
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:50,541
Oh, yeah. I missed these fucking things.

[crunching]
Went to the doctor the other day.

2
00:00:14,041 --> 00:00:15,666
Was having some chest pains and sweating

3
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:17,458
like a camel whore in sand land.

4
00:00:17,541 --> 00:00:19,958
Doc told me I'm okay,
but I've got the high blood pressures

5
00:00:20,041 --> 00:00:22,416
and high "clestrall,"
whatever the fuck that is.

6
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:25,000
Now I gotta eat this kinda shit.
Got some cabbage here,

7
00:00:25,083 --> 00:00:27,750
some beans, some broccoli,
one of these "egglet" things,

8
00:00:27,833 --> 00:00:29,375
and I got the Brussels sprouts.

00:00:29,458 --> 00:00:31,833
Here you go.
Another side of chicken gravy, sir.

10
00:00:31,916 --> 00:00:33,083
Thank you, "gar-sin".

11
00:00:33,166 --> 00:00:35,000
Bit of gravy kills the taste of this shit.

12
00:00:35,083 --> 00:00:37,625

is not too fucking bad.

Fuck, I got some power today.

15
00:00:41,791 --> 00:00:44,333
That's the problem with eating this shit.
It gives you tons of gas.

16
00:00:44,416 --> 00:00:46,708
It smells worse
than Satan's sweaty ass-pussy.

Oh, my God, that stinks!

20

There's my cue. Okay, everybody,
my name's Tom Peterson.

21
00:00:57,125 --> 00:00:59,666

Smells like a gas leak.

I owe 28 grand?

You better fuck off with the threats.
I'll get it, okay?

I'm not allowed to get angry

so I can get high,

you government tax fuckheads.

42
00:01:47,708 --> 00:01:50,625
-[phone continues ringing]
-Why in the fuck is the <i>oonaverse</i>

43
00:01:50,708 --> 00:01:54,375
shitting into my mouth and shoving
a watermelon up my ass again? Why?

44
00:01:54,458 --> 00:01:58,458
[piano theme music playing]

45
00:02:02,166 --> 00:02:04,041
… 94, 95--

46
00:02:04,125 --> 00:02:07,125
Oh, you fucking hard-packed
son of a whore!

47
00:02:07,208 --> 00:02:09,541
Bubs, can you chill for a sec?
I'm trying to count over here.

48
00:02:09,625 --> 00:02:10,583
Well, I'm fucking sorry.

49
00:02:10,666 --> 00:02:14,458
Do you know how hard this ground's packed?
It's like a diamond that King Kong shit!

50
00:02:14,541 --> 00:02:17,125
Bubs, just relax.
I'll help you out in a minute, okay?

51
00:02:17,208 --> 00:02:18,041
Yeah. [grunts]

52
00:02:18,125 --> 00:02:22,875
[sighs] 96, 97, 98, 99, 10, 000.

53
00:02:22,958 --> 00:02:27,666
-[Bubbles grunts]
-Beautiful. Money well spent. Trust me.

54
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,541
Bubs, you sure you don't want in on this?

55
00:02:29,625 --> 00:02:31,916
I don't want in on your bullshit.

56
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,041
[Julian] Okay, well,
you're gonna be sorry.

57
00:02:34,125 --> 00:02:36,000
Oh, I've been so sorry in the past

58
00:02:36,083 --> 00:02:38,583
from all your successes
that I missed out on.

59
00:02:38,666 --> 00:02:41,750
Alright. Good doing business with you,
Big Hawk. Thanks, man.

60
00:02:41,833 --> 00:02:43,291
I appreciate this opportunity.

61
00:02:43,833 --> 00:02:47,333
I may have another one of these
coming up in a few weeks.

62
00:02:47,875 --> 00:02:48,708
Interested?

63
00:02:48,791 --> 00:02:51,125
Fuck yeah. You're the man, Hawk.

64
00:02:51,208 --> 00:02:52,958
[laughs] Big Hawk out.

65
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,833
A few times a year, this trucking company
that delivers booze and beer

66
00:02:57,916 --> 00:03:00,916
to liquor stores has an "accident"
that never really happens.

67
00:03:01,291 --> 00:03:05,250
Big Hawk then pays the trucking company
50 grand for 150 grand worth of booze.

68
00:03:05,333 --> 00:03:07,875
Then they sell it for 100,
doubling their money.

69
00:03:07,958 --> 00:03:11,625
I pawned my Monte Carlo for ten grand,
so, soon, I'm gonna have enough money

70
00:03:11,708 --> 00:03:13,375
to buy fucking 3 of them if I wanted to.

71
00:03:13,458 --> 00:03:16,291
[both grunting]

72
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,708
[groans] That's perfect

73
00:03:19,166 --> 00:03:20,791
Thanks, Julian. I appreciate it.

74
00:03:20,875 --> 00:03:24,250
I mean, that titanium upper body of yours
sure cut the time in half.

75
00:03:24,333 --> 00:03:25,791
Yeah, real funny, Bubs.

76
00:03:25,875 --> 00:03:27,083
I'm just teasing you.

77
00:03:27,166 --> 00:03:29,916
Holy fuck,
my cats are gonna love this new kitty spa.

78
00:03:30,291 --> 00:03:32,125
I didn't think cats could swim, man.

79
00:03:32,208 --> 00:03:35,208
Cats can swim better than fucking dogs,
I'll have you know.

80
00:03:35,291 --> 00:03:38,708
Oh, baby. Now they're gonna be able
to cool off during this heat wave.

81
00:03:38,791 --> 00:03:41,500
Fucking global warming
can take a big lick on my taint.

82
00:03:42,041 --> 00:03:44,625
Alright, Paul McCatney,
when you're finished cooling off,

83
00:03:44,708 --> 00:03:46,791
I'm gonna give you
a nice blast with the dryer.

84
00:03:46,875 --> 00:03:49,291
Then I'm gonna do a full round
of belly work on you.

85
00:03:49,416 --> 00:03:51,625
[cooing, giggling]

86
00:03:51,708 --> 00:03:54,041
Full cat spa treatment for you,
little buddy.

87
00:03:56,916 --> 00:03:59,166
Oh, fuck, Ricky.
What happened to your face?

88
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:01,541
You look like
you were French-kissing an escalator.

89
00:04:01,625 --> 00:04:04,333
Had a little incident
at the fucking gas station in Spryfield.

90
00:04:04,416 --> 00:04:06,208
What kind of an incident?

91
00:04:07,541 --> 00:04:10,916
[Ricky] <i>Nobody fuckin' move! Give me</i>
<i>all your money and your cigarettes!</i>

92
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,583
<i>Fuck off. You won't shoot me.</i>

93
00:04:12,666 --> 00:04:16,041
<i>Listen, weird hair,</i>
<i>I don't</i> <i>have time for fucking games.</i>

94
00:04:16,125 --> 00:04:18,166
[Ricky coughs, screams]

95
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:20,291
[yelling] <i>Fuck, my fucking hand! Jesus!</i>

96
00:04:20,375 --> 00:04:22,250
<i>Just fuck out of here, loser!</i>

97
00:04:22,333 --> 00:04:24,958
-[fire extinguisher clangs]
-[Ricky screams]

98
00:04:25,041 --> 00:04:27,458
<i>Fuck off</i>
<i>with the fucking fire extinguisher!</i>

99
00:04:27,583 --> 00:04:30,291
[farting]
<i>You fucking green-haired bastard bitch!</i>

100
00:04:30,375 --> 00:04:32,125
<i>-Go! Get the fuck out!</i>
-[Ricky]<i> God damn it!</i>

101
00:04:32,208 --> 00:04:33,375
-[clanging]
-[Ricky screams]

102
00:04:33,458 --> 00:04:35,791
You got the shit beat outta you
with a fire extinguisher.

103
00:04:35,875 --> 00:04:38,208
That's great, Ricky.
You should check your brain.

104
00:04:38,291 --> 00:04:40,625
Yeah, and I had to leave my gun there,
for fuck's sake.

105
00:04:40,708 --> 00:04:43,291
My favorite gun the old man gave me.
Now it's gone forever.

106
00:04:43,375 --> 00:04:47,250
Jesus Christ. Why the fuck would you rob
a gas station anyway? That's greasy.

107
00:04:47,333 --> 00:04:50,333
Because I owe the cock-vacuuming CRA
28 grand in taxes.

108
00:04:50,416 --> 00:04:53,125
If I don't pay it in three days,
I go to jail for a long time.

109
00:04:53,208 --> 00:04:54,583
It's a fuckin' felony offense.

110
00:04:54,666 --> 00:04:57,375
Wait, what do you mean?
They said "felony offense"?

111
00:04:57,458 --> 00:04:59,333
-Yeah.
-Well, that doesn't make sense.

112
00:04:59,416 --> 00:05:01,541
There's no such thing as a felony
in Canada.

113
00:05:01,625 --> 00:05:04,708
-They were fucking scamming you, idiot.
-[Ricky] No, they weren't.

114
00:05:04,791 --> 00:05:06,208
-They were.
-You should've heard the big words

115
00:05:06,291 --> 00:05:09,750
they were using: "grand jury,"
"subpoe-ni-a," "incarcerating."

116
00:05:09,833 --> 00:05:10,708
It's fucked.

117
00:05:10,833 --> 00:05:13,125
You've never worked
a fucking day in your life.

118
00:05:13,208 --> 00:05:15,875
How are they charging you
for back income taxes?

119
00:05:15,958 --> 00:05:17,041
Better not be a fucking scam.

120
00:05:17,125 --> 00:05:19,291
That green-haired ninja witch
beat the shit out of me.

121
00:05:19,375 --> 00:05:22,208
Let me see your phone.
I'm gonna call them. This is bullshit.

122
00:05:22,291 --> 00:05:25,166
[phone beeps, rings]

123
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:28,000
[man on phone] <i>Investigation Division,</i>
<i>Canada Revenue Agency.</i>

<i>How may I help you, sir?</i>

125
00:05:29,458 --> 00:05:31,125
Yes, hi there.

126
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:35,208
Uh, I'm an old man,
and I'm hoping that you can tell me

127
00:05:35,291 --> 00:05:38,333
why I owe you cocksuckers
all this tax money.

128
00:05:38,416 --> 00:05:41,875
<i>One moment, sir. Let me look up your file</i>

129
00:05:41,958 --> 00:05:46,000
<i>Yes.</i> <i>Yes, here it is, sir.</i>
<i>We did an audit for the last several years</i>

130

<i>and found errors with your income tax.</i>

131
00:05:48,125 --> 00:05:52,791
Oh, yeah, okay. Well, I might have
to call bull fucking shit on that,

132
00:05:52,875 --> 00:05:54,541
because I don't pay taxes.

133

-Actually, I'd like to pay...

<i>Excuse me? How about I issue you</i>

140
00:06:12,166 --> 00:06:15,458
<i>You'll have to appear before a grand jury.</i>

Check your fucking hole for a dead rat.

143
00:06:19,083 --> 00:06:23,750
Yeah, listen, bud. I have an idea.
Why don't all you scamming assholes

144
00:06:23,833 --> 00:06:26,791
stop tricking people
out of their goddamn hard-earned money?

145
00:06:26,875 --> 00:06:29,541
And when you're done doing that,
go fuck yourselves!

146
00:06:29,625 --> 00:06:32,208
<i>Now you've done it, sir.</i>
<i>The police are coming to your house,</i>

147
00:06:32,291 --> 00:06:35,916

<i>you're happy with yourself. Goodbye.</i>

148
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,791
[groans] That smells like a pile of shit
ate a whole bunch of shit

149
00:06:40,875 --> 00:06:43,250
and then shit it out. Oh, I can taste it.

150
00:06:43,375 --> 00:06:44,208
[Ricky farts]

151
00:06:44,666 --> 00:06:48,083
Jesus Christ, Ricky.
What the fuck is up with your ass, man?

152
00:06:48,166 --> 00:06:50,083
It's my new diet.
It's fucking up my "testine."

153
00:06:50,166 --> 00:06:51,833
-[door slams]
-Oh, God.

154
00:06:52,333 --> 00:06:54,125
Oh, dear. Oh my God.

155
00:06:54,208 --> 00:06:55,916
[Bubbles] Are you okay, Marguerite?
What's going on?

156
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,833
Fucking heartless cocksuckers.

157
00:06:57,916 --> 00:07:02,291
I had to give the CRA nine fucking grand.

158
00:07:02,375 --> 00:07:04,875
How in the fuck
am I going to pay my lot fees now?

159
00:07:04,958 --> 00:07:08,416
Start hanging out at the dock
giving handies to sailors again?

160
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:10,375
Marguerite, it was a scam.

161
00:07:10,458 --> 00:07:13,875
-A scam?
-[man] You asshole! I just need time!

162
00:07:13,958 --> 00:07:17,625
It's not my fault
the government raped my shit pipe!

163
00:07:17,708 --> 00:07:19,583
Donny, what the fuck is going on?

164
00:07:19,666 --> 00:07:23,250
I'll tell you what's going on,
you muscular cocksucker!

165
00:07:23,333 --> 00:07:28,791
The CRA rammed their 17-foot, slithering,
oiled-up cock

166
00:07:28,875 --> 00:07:31,916
right down my gravelly fucking throat!

167
00:07:33,416 --> 00:07:36,625
Alright, thanks a lot for coming.
I just brought you guys here today

168
00:07:36,708 --> 00:07:38,791
to warn you about a phone scam
that's going on.

169
00:07:39,291 --> 00:07:41,625
Some residents have been conned
out of money.

170
00:07:42,125 --> 00:07:45,541
There's these fucking people
posing as government dicks from the CRA.

171
00:07:45,625 --> 00:07:47,250
You fucking shitting me, man?

172
00:07:47,541 --> 00:07:49,500
They called me, too. That was a scam?

173
00:07:49,583 --> 00:07:51,875
Oh, my God. Julian, they called me!

174
00:07:51,958 --> 00:07:53,833
They said that I owe them four grand.

175
00:07:53,916 --> 00:07:56,250
They called me too, Julian. What the frig?

176
00:07:56,333 --> 00:07:58,416
Oh, for fuck's sakes. Are you kidding me?

177
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:00,833
How many of you have been contacted
by these people?

178
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,083
Holy shit.
And how many of you guys paid them?

179
00:08:05,166 --> 00:08:06,583
[man] This is fucking bullshit!

180
00:08:06,666 --> 00:08:09,333
Fuck me. They must have targeted
our fucking trailer park.

181
00:08:09,416 --> 00:08:11,416
Julian, we have to call the police.

182
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:15,416
No police. We get the police involved,
our money's gonna be tied up for months.

183
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:18,458
Don't worry about a thing.
I'm gonna get your money back, okay?

184
00:08:18,541 --> 00:08:21,208
[lowers voice] For a small fee.
[loud] Nobody fucks with Sunnyvale!

185
00:08:21,291 --> 00:08:23,625
The hardest part is gonna be
trying to find these fuckers,

186
00:08:23,708 --> 00:08:25,625
but I've got Bubs
over there on the computer.

187
00:08:25,708 --> 00:08:28,000
I've got full confidence
he can search something up--

188
00:08:28,083 --> 00:08:31,291
Just did a reverse lookup
on the number, Julian. Nothing.

189
00:08:31,375 --> 00:08:33,625
These guys are fucking good.
I'm telling you.

190
00:08:33,708 --> 00:08:34,916
Oh, for fuck's sakes.

191
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,750
<i>I also sent Randy to the police station</i>

192
00:08:36,833 --> 00:08:38,625
<i>to try to suck some information</i>
<i>out of Ted,</i>

193
00:08:38,708 --> 00:08:40,041
<i>but he came up with nothing.</i>

194
00:08:40,125 --> 00:08:42,541
I'm not sure
where the fuck to go from here.

195
00:08:42,625 --> 00:08:46,541
Ricky says he's got it all figured out,
which basically means we're fucked.

196
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:49,583
Why does my brain have to be
such an asshole?

197
00:08:49,666 --> 00:08:51,958
It knows how to figure this shit out,
and it won't tell me.

198
00:08:52,041 --> 00:08:53,333
What does that even mean, Dad?

199
00:08:53,416 --> 00:08:55,500
I had the answer
on how to get these tax fuckers,

200
00:08:55,583 --> 00:08:56,875
and then it got gone.

201
00:08:56,958 --> 00:08:59,250
Maybe I need to get more high.
Maybe that'll make it come back.

202
00:08:59,333 --> 00:09:03,875
Okay. I guess anything's worth a try.
Listen, I'm really proud of you.

203
00:09:03,958 --> 00:09:06,375
Ugh, I'm not sure
how you eat this stuff, though.

204
00:09:06,458 --> 00:09:09,333
It's actually not that bad.
Is there any marshmallow-y stuff here

205
00:09:09,416 --> 00:09:10,250
or Cheez Whiz?

206
00:09:10,916 --> 00:09:13,375
I just wish
the fucking cocksucking CRA was a mouse,

207
00:09:13,458 --> 00:09:15,875
'cause I could set a trap.
Put a piece of cheese and snap,

208
00:09:15,958 --> 00:09:18,541
I got the little fuckers.
But no, they're not a mouse.

209
00:09:18,625 --> 00:09:21,666
Well, just wait, Dad.
I think you just figured it out.

210
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:24,208
-What do you mean?
-That's it, a trap.

211
00:09:24,291 --> 00:09:27,166
But I'd never find a trap that big.
And I don't wanna kill them.

212
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:29,958
-I wanna catch the fuckers.
-No, I don't mean catch them

213
00:09:30,041 --> 00:09:34,000
in a real trap. You don't wanna kill them.
I just mean set a trap, lure them in,

214
00:09:34,083 --> 00:09:37,416
-and then you'll know who they are.
-A trap. Holy fuck!

215
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:39,583
That's it, Trin. Holy fuck, you're smart.

216
00:09:39,666 --> 00:09:43,291
I just need to set a fucking trap.
Fuck you, brain. I win again.

217
00:09:44,791 --> 00:09:47,541
I figured it out.
Just needed to be the right level of high.

218
00:09:47,625 --> 00:09:50,416
-[mumbling] Oh, yeah. This should be good.
-It is good. Mousetrap.

219
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:51,791
Just treat them like a mouse.

220
00:09:51,875 --> 00:09:53,958
Fucking mouse like cheese,
so instead, this time,

221
00:09:54,041 --> 00:09:56,541
the cheese'll be like a cash,
and the mouse's gonna be,

222
00:09:56,625 --> 00:09:59,208
well, it'd be a car,
but someone gets in the car,

223
00:09:59,291 --> 00:10:01,000
and then they'd come
to try to drive to get the cheese--

224
00:10:01,083 --> 00:10:02,500
-Ricky!
-And the cheese would--

225
00:10:02,583 --> 00:10:04,208
Deep breath. What're you talking about?

226
00:10:04,291 --> 00:10:07,958
Fuck! Just tell the lowlife fucks
that I have the money, in cash,

227
00:10:08,041 --> 00:10:10,333
and they need to pick it up,
'cause I'm not taking that cash in public.

228
00:10:10,416 --> 00:10:13,375
-Oh, come on, man.
-These people aren't idiots.

229
00:10:13,458 --> 00:10:16,291
You're not gonna just fucking have them
stroll up to your trailer.

230
00:10:16,375 --> 00:10:17,958
I know. They said they couldn't do that.

231
00:10:18,041 --> 00:10:19,416
What? You called them back?

232
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:20,708
Yeah, the trap is set.

233
00:10:20,791 --> 00:10:22,500
We're meeting near the old bridge
in four hours.

234
00:10:22,583 --> 00:10:24,458
Wicked, me and Jacob are in 100 percent.

235
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:25,708
Yeah, we got your backs.

236
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:28,666
Not happening. We've got one shot here.
We can't risk you two fucking it up.

237
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:29,583
Yup.

238
00:10:31,291 --> 00:10:33,208
Oh, boys.

239
00:10:33,875 --> 00:10:36,958
They're 15 minutes late here.
I'm telling you, boys,

240
00:10:37,041 --> 00:10:40,083
these people are not dummies.
They're running a sophisticated operation.

241
00:10:40,166 --> 00:10:44,000
They're not just gonna stroll down here
under the dirty, old, goddamn bridge.

242
00:10:44,083 --> 00:10:46,000
Bubs, they're greasy.
They're gonna want the cash.

243
00:10:46,083 --> 00:10:47,541
They're gonna show up.
Don't worry about it.

244
00:10:47,625 --> 00:10:48,958
-[phone ringing]
-I am worried about it.

245
00:10:49,083 --> 00:10:51,041
-[phone beeps]
-Yo, Big Hawk, what's up, man?

246
00:10:52,166 --> 00:10:55,833
What? What the fuck are you talking about?
What about my money?

247
00:10:56,666 --> 00:10:59,000
Oh, you gotta be kidding me, man. Fuck!

248
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:01,666
All right. Thanks for the heads up,
I guess.

249
00:11:02,166 --> 00:11:03,458
For fuck's sakes!

250
00:11:04,083 --> 00:11:07,500
[sighs] The deal got fucked over.
Big Hawk got in a real accident

251
00:11:07,583 --> 00:11:09,208
-with the booze truck.
-What's that mean?

252
00:11:09,291 --> 00:11:12,000
It means that my ten grand's gone.
That's what it fucking means.

253
00:11:12,083 --> 00:11:15,708
Julian, I'm not one to slap a fellow
with a cock when he's down,

254
00:11:15,791 --> 00:11:19,416
but I'm telling you, I believe I told you
that it was too good to be true.

255
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:20,666
Bubs, not now.

256
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:23,291
-Thank God I didn't go in on it.
-That's enough.

257
00:11:23,375 --> 00:11:25,333
Fuck. Sorry, boys. Here it comes.

258
00:11:25,416 --> 00:11:27,291
-[farts]
-Wait, what? Sorry for what?

259
00:11:27,375 --> 00:11:29,541
-Oh, my fuck, Ricky!
-[Julian] Ricky!

260
00:11:29,625 --> 00:11:31,625
Are you trying to kill us
with your ass vapor?

261
00:11:31,708 --> 00:11:33,583
There's an actual haze coming out of you.

262
00:11:33,666 --> 00:11:35,958
Fuck, I can't breathe.
Fuck, I can taste it.

263
00:11:36,041 --> 00:11:37,666
It's like a hot rag of stink!

264
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:40,458
It's not my fault. I can't hold them in.
It'll fuck up my blood pressures.

265
00:11:40,541 --> 00:11:42,625
At least get out of the fucking car
next time.

266
00:11:42,708 --> 00:11:44,833
Show some goddamn mercy to our lungs.

267
00:11:44,916 --> 00:11:47,416
Boys, look. I knew it. I told you guys.

268
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:49,458
Never underestimate the power of money.

269
00:11:50,166 --> 00:11:52,708
We need to play this smart. Flank the car.
Guy on each side,

270
00:11:52,791 --> 00:11:54,041
one of us comes up from behind.

271
00:11:54,125 --> 00:11:57,458
[whispering] What about a distraction?
Maybe throw a rock and hit the roof?

272
00:11:57,541 --> 00:11:59,875
Yeah, I like that.
Ricky, I'll signal you whe--

273
00:11:59,958 --> 00:12:02,166
-Okay, tit meat, out of the car.
-[man groans]

274
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:03,750
Ricky! Fuck's sakes!

275
00:12:03,833 --> 00:12:06,125
That's an assault on a CRA investigator!

276
00:12:06,208 --> 00:12:08,500
The wig is up, you bottom-feeding bitch.
You're coming with us.

277
00:12:08,583 --> 00:12:10,541
We can do this the easy way
or the hard way.

278
00:12:10,625 --> 00:12:11,958
I like option B,

279
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:13,250
the hard way.

280
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:14,708
[ominous tone]

281
00:12:14,791 --> 00:12:16,708
-[hard impact]
-[Ricky screams]

282
00:12:16,791 --> 00:12:19,583
-He just fucked my ass with his foot!
-[CRA man grunting]

283
00:12:19,666 --> 00:12:21,750
Oh, my God. That was Bruce Lee-type shit.

284
00:12:21,833 --> 00:12:23,791
I'm gonna knock you out, bigger boy,

285
00:12:23,875 --> 00:12:26,875
and then I'm going to fuck those big,
meaty tits of yours!

286
00:12:26,958 --> 00:12:28,291
-[hard punch]
-[CRA man groans]

287
00:12:28,916 --> 00:12:31,500
We need to get the fuck out of here.
Somebody grab his legs.

288
00:12:31,583 --> 00:12:33,875
Ugh, God, I think the tube part of my ass
is bleeding.

289
00:12:33,958 --> 00:12:34,791
Fuck, it hurts.

290
00:12:35,875 --> 00:12:38,875
Fuck, these kale chips
are spicy as a Spanish-anese hooker.

291
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:41,000
You wipe that smug look
off your fucking face!

292
00:12:41,083 --> 00:12:42,291
Where's the call center?

293
00:12:42,375 --> 00:12:43,708
Know what? You can fuck yourself.

294
00:12:43,791 --> 00:12:44,666
Oh, is that right?

295
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:47,750
When I get free,
I'm going to break 618 bones in this room.

296
00:12:47,833 --> 00:12:52,000
Um, boys, just so you're aware,
that's precisely the number

297
00:12:52,083 --> 00:12:54,625
of all the bones
in all of our bodies combined.

298
00:12:54,708 --> 00:12:57,416
God damn it. Here we go again.
I can't hold it in.

299
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:58,666
-Hold it in.
-[Bubbles] No!

300
00:12:58,750 --> 00:12:59,958
Hold that fucking thing in.

301
00:13:00,041 --> 00:13:01,458
-Too late.
-Oh, my fuck!

302
00:13:01,541 --> 00:13:04,083
-What the fuck is wrong with you?
-Holy mother of God. I can't breathe.

303
00:13:04,166 --> 00:13:06,666
-Fuck, I feel another one coming on.
-[Bubbles] Oh, no, Ricky, please!

304
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:11,875
Go outside! Ricky!
Holy fuck. Everybody down! Stink rises!

305
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:13,875
Oh, shit. Another one's comin'--

306
00:13:14,041 --> 00:13:15,958
-Go the fuck outside!
-Please don't drop another one.

307
00:13:16,041 --> 00:13:18,208
Ricky, actually pinch it off! Hold it in!

308
00:13:18,291 --> 00:13:20,291
-I can't hold it in!
-Ricky, hold it in!

309
00:13:20,375 --> 00:13:22,041
-Fuck!
-I have an idea.

310
00:13:23,458 --> 00:13:26,208
Okay, bud, where are you running
your operation out of?

311
00:13:26,291 --> 00:13:27,541
Fuck you, old-lady eyes.

312
00:13:27,625 --> 00:13:32,666
Oh, fuck me, eh? Okay, bud.
Ricky, set your ass to stun.

313
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:33,791
[laughs] Gladly.

314
00:13:33,875 --> 00:13:34,958
[farts]

315
00:13:35,041 --> 00:13:35,916
[gasps]

316
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
[laughs] You like that?
You want another one?

317
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:40,458
What about the Geneva Convention?
There's rules now.

318
00:13:40,541 --> 00:13:41,875
[farts]

319
00:13:41,958 --> 00:13:45,708
[sobbing] Okay!

320
00:13:45,791 --> 00:13:48,041
Ready to talk,
or you want another puff of choke juice?

321
00:13:48,125 --> 00:13:52,041
For the love of Shiva,
take this fucking bag off before I die.

322
00:13:53,083 --> 00:13:54,333
It's in Moncton.

323
00:13:55,041 --> 00:13:56,041
I take you there.

324
00:13:56,125 --> 00:13:58,666
Fucking right you will.
Right the fuck now. Let's go, boys.

325
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:00,541
We don't know who we're dealing with here.

326
00:14:00,625 --> 00:14:02,500
You know, could be the Mafia,
could be bikers.

327
00:14:02,583 --> 00:14:04,875
It could be
the Pakistani equivalent of the Yakuza.

328
00:14:04,958 --> 00:14:07,750
We can't just go there,
just the three of us, with one gun.

329
00:14:08,916 --> 00:14:09,750
Fuck's sakes.

330
00:14:11,041 --> 00:14:13,000
Yo T, I need your help
to take down the scammers

331
00:14:13,083 --> 00:14:16,291
-and get everybody's money back.
-Fuck, man. You mean, like, right now?

332
00:14:16,375 --> 00:14:19,333
Man, I don't think we can do it, dawg.
Pretty fucked up right now.

333
00:14:19,416 --> 00:14:20,625
We need some choppers, too.

334
00:14:20,708 --> 00:14:23,541
-[laughs] Some choppers?
-[Julian] Yeah, some choppers.

335
00:14:23,625 --> 00:14:25,791
Not sure if we can go anywhere, man.
We can't move.

336
00:14:25,875 --> 00:14:26,916
What do you mean?

337
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,416
Edibles, man. We high as a motherfucker.

338
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:30,333
Oh, great.

339
00:14:30,416 --> 00:14:33,916
Green's dumb ass thought they was 50 mg.
Turns out they was 500.

340
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,166
-These are fucking 500?
-Shit's crazy, man.

341
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:38,958
Yo, Green, grab these ma'fuckers
some of the heavy artillery.

342
00:14:39,041 --> 00:14:41,416
-The big guns. Get the big ones.
-[shots fire]

343
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:42,583
[groaning]

344
00:14:42,666 --> 00:14:44,166
What the fuck?

345
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:46,666
-[man] Whoa, fuck.
-Sorry, man. Fuckin' lit.

346
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:49,250
Green, what the fuck?
You always fucking up, man.

347
00:14:49,333 --> 00:14:50,791
-He's always fucking up.
-Nice going.

348
00:14:50,875 --> 00:14:53,458
You guys are gonna be fucked for, like,
12 hours. I'm jealous.

349
00:14:53,541 --> 00:14:54,666
Pull back on it, Cory!

350
00:14:55,583 --> 00:14:56,416
[breaking glass]

351
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:58,333
[man yelling] Jesus fucking Christ!

352
00:14:58,416 --> 00:15:02,416
Who in the fuck just flew
a goddamn cocksucking kite

353
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:04,125
into my living room?

354
00:15:04,208 --> 00:15:05,041
Cunt!

355
00:15:05,125 --> 00:15:06,416
Can't believe I'm thinking this.

356
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:07,708
Julian, don't you dare.<i> </i>

357
00:15:07,791 --> 00:15:08,750
We have no choice, man.

358
00:15:08,833 --> 00:15:09,750
-Julian!
-Bubs!

359
00:15:15,166 --> 00:15:16,083
Shut the fuck up.

360
00:15:16,666 --> 00:15:17,666
[trunk slams shut]

361
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:20,625
-Why can't we have machine guns?
-Not a fucking chance.

362
00:15:20,708 --> 00:15:22,166
Boys, what's the plan here?

363
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:24,125
I'm sure they have security and guns

364
00:15:24,208 --> 00:15:26,250
and fuck knows
what other Jackie Chan types

365
00:15:26,333 --> 00:15:27,583
are lurking around in there.

366
00:15:27,666 --> 00:15:28,833
We gotta surprise them.

367
00:15:28,916 --> 00:15:30,333
[shot fires]

368
00:15:30,416 --> 00:15:32,333
-Nice going, fucking idiot.
-[car alarm blares]

369
00:15:32,416 --> 00:15:33,750
Shit, dude. I'm sorry.

370
00:15:33,833 --> 00:15:36,458
So much for surprise there,
fucking jerk-in-the-box.

371
00:15:36,541 --> 00:15:39,250
Fucking idiots.
Oh, well, fuck it. No choice now.

372
00:15:39,791 --> 00:15:43,000
Cory, Jacob, you guys wait here.
Do you know what that fucking means?

373
00:15:43,083 --> 00:15:44,500
-[barks]
-Got it, Julian.

374
00:15:44,583 --> 00:15:47,083
All right, cover us.
Okay, boys. Let's do this.

375
00:15:47,166 --> 00:15:48,625
Everybody on the fucking ground!

376
00:15:48,708 --> 00:15:50,500
Do it, get down! Now!

377
00:15:50,583 --> 00:15:52,250
Give us the fucking money! Now!

378
00:15:52,333 --> 00:15:53,583
Where's your fucking safe?

379
00:15:53,666 --> 00:15:55,833
There's no safe.
The money's in offshore bank accounts.

380
00:15:55,916 --> 00:15:58,958
You fucking pieces of shit.
We should shoot every one of you.

381
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:01,000
Not our fault. They're forcing us.
We're illegals.

382
00:16:01,083 --> 00:16:02,750
They threaten to call immigration on us.

383
00:16:02,833 --> 00:16:04,666
Oh, my God. That's fucking horrible.

384
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:07,208
Boys, put the guns down. Put them down.

385
00:16:07,291 --> 00:16:08,916
They pay us 50 dollars a week,

386
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,083
and then they only feed us
if we make them money.

387
00:16:11,166 --> 00:16:12,958
And it's just bread and chicken gravy.

388
00:16:13,041 --> 00:16:15,083
Is it real chicken gravy
or that shit from a can?

389
00:16:15,166 --> 00:16:18,541
Ricky, I don't think
where the gravy comes from is the issue.

390
00:16:18,625 --> 00:16:20,458
They're being treated like slaves in here!

391
00:16:20,541 --> 00:16:24,375
Well, we're fucked then. I don't know
shit-all about offshore bank accounts,

392
00:16:24,458 --> 00:16:25,291
for fuck's sakes.

393
00:16:25,375 --> 00:16:27,458
God damn it.
Well, if we're not getting the money,

394
00:16:27,541 --> 00:16:29,666
we're at least making sure
nobody else gets scammed.

395
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:32,000
[agents screaming]

396
00:16:32,083 --> 00:16:34,875
[grunting] Fuck you!

397
00:16:34,958 --> 00:16:37,958
Ricky, calm down. Your blood pressure.
And you could fart!

398
00:16:38,833 --> 00:16:42,458
Surprise, you fruity, fairy fucks.
Break one more thing,

399
00:16:42,541 --> 00:16:44,833
and you're fucking dead.
Put down your fucking guns,

400
00:16:44,916 --> 00:16:47,625
or we shoot Tweedle Dum
and Tweedle Fucked-in-the-Head!

401
00:16:47,708 --> 00:16:51,041
I don't fucking think so, dickhead.
You guys put down your fucking guns!

402
00:16:51,125 --> 00:16:52,250
Fuck you!

403
00:16:52,333 --> 00:16:54,750
You stole from Sunnyvale,
and we want our money back, Cyrus.

404
00:16:54,833 --> 00:16:57,750
You guys stole my beautiful,
perfect balls. Remember?

405
00:16:57,875 --> 00:17:00,916
-You think I'd just let that go?
-How are your clacker balls, Fonzie?

406
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:06,666
Shut up. My brand-new synthetic nuts
are bigger and better than ever.

407
00:17:07,416 --> 00:17:08,541
Holy fuck.

408
00:17:08,916 --> 00:17:11,958
They look like two giant, polished pearls,
covered with perfectly-groomed hair.

409
00:17:12,041 --> 00:17:14,166
No, man, they look more
like two fucking cabbages

410
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:16,166
that've been in the sun,
and a bird shit on 'em.

411
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:19,875
Is there any particular reason why you two
are analyzing his balls with such detail?

412
00:17:19,958 --> 00:17:23,083
These new balls
added over two feet to my spray,

413
00:17:23,166 --> 00:17:24,916
and Sunnyvale paid for them.

414
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:25,833
Oh, yeah!

415
00:17:25,916 --> 00:17:26,916
[breaking glass]

416
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,250
Hey, what the fuck did I say?

417
00:17:29,333 --> 00:17:30,750
-[fires shot]
-[Ricky screams]

418
00:17:30,875 --> 00:17:31,958
Fucking shot! [shoots]

419
00:17:32,041 --> 00:17:34,583
[gunshots]

420
00:17:34,666 --> 00:17:37,458
Give us the money, and we'll leave.
There's no way out of this, Cyrus.

421
00:17:37,958 --> 00:17:39,791
We'll shoot our way out of here
if we have to.

422
00:17:39,875 --> 00:17:42,375
You're not fucking over
my million-dollar business!

423
00:17:42,458 --> 00:17:44,541
Wait, did you say a million?

424
00:17:44,625 --> 00:17:47,583
You made a million fucking dollars
from this, scamming people?

425
00:17:47,666 --> 00:17:50,500
That's right.
The C-man is a fucking millionaire.

426
00:17:50,583 --> 00:17:53,208
I'm driving a fucking Ferrari. Boom!

427
00:17:53,291 --> 00:17:55,500
Right over there in the corner.
Check it out.

428
00:17:56,166 --> 00:17:58,375
A year newer than Magnum P.I.'s!

429
00:17:58,833 --> 00:18:00,708
Holy fuck, boys. Look at that thing.

430
00:18:00,791 --> 00:18:03,666
-He made a million fucking dollars.
-Who cares?

431
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:04,875
[Julian] New plan, Cyrus.

432
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:07,500
Let's stop fucking shooting
before someone gets hurt.

433
00:18:07,583 --> 00:18:10,208
I'm all ears,
you big fucking Adonis wannabe.

434
00:18:10,291 --> 00:18:12,416
How about I don't call the cops,

435
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,666
-and you cut me in?
-Fuck that.

436
00:18:15,083 --> 00:18:17,791
I'm serious.
I could double your profits, man, easily.

437
00:18:17,875 --> 00:18:21,166
Help you expand in other markets,
like the US for instance.

438
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:23,083
That's where the real money is, man.

439
00:18:23,166 --> 00:18:25,000
Julian, what the fuck are you doing?

440
00:18:25,083 --> 00:18:26,583
Yeah, are you fucking losing it?

441
00:18:26,666 --> 00:18:29,291
Boys, this is a shit-ton of money.
That's what the fuck I'm doing.

442
00:18:29,375 --> 00:18:33,208
Julian, don't you dare cross over
to the dark side because of money.

443
00:18:33,291 --> 00:18:36,333
Fifteen points,
or we start shooting again.

444
00:18:36,708 --> 00:18:38,041
Twenty, and you got a deal.

445
00:18:38,125 --> 00:18:39,458
Fuck's sakes.

446
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,458
Okay, deal.

447
00:18:41,541 --> 00:18:44,541
Okay, just a sec.
I want ten grand up-front,

448
00:18:44,625 --> 00:18:47,208
and I want the keys
to your car for a week.

449
00:18:47,666 --> 00:18:48,958
Not a fucking chance.

450
00:18:49,041 --> 00:18:52,375
Guess I'm calling the cops, then.
You wanna act all tough, Cyrus?

451
00:18:52,458 --> 00:18:55,041
You show me how big those new balls
really are then.

452
00:18:55,458 --> 00:18:57,125
You've got five fucking seconds!

453
00:18:59,833 --> 00:19:01,208
Julian, one last time.

454
00:19:01,291 --> 00:19:04,166
What the flying fuck
are you doing right now?

455
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:06,750
This ten grand makes up
for the money I lost with Big Hawk,

456
00:19:06,833 --> 00:19:09,083
and I'll be able to get the fucking Carlo
out of pawn.

457
00:19:09,166 --> 00:19:10,833
But you and Cyrus will be partners.

458
00:19:10,916 --> 00:19:12,750
You do get that, right? Without us.

459
00:19:12,833 --> 00:19:14,416
Fuck off.

460
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:16,375
You heard him. He knows what he's doing.

461
00:19:16,458 --> 00:19:19,333
He wants real business partners,
not gay dummies.

462
00:19:19,416 --> 00:19:21,375
-Julian!
-I'm sorry, but I've never had

463
00:19:21,458 --> 00:19:23,541
an opportunity like this
before in my life.

464
00:19:23,625 --> 00:19:24,583
Are you the real Julian,

465
00:19:24,666 --> 00:19:28,000
or are you some other Julian
that warped in, took the old Julian out,

466
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:29,958
and now he's here talking
like a different Julian?

467
00:19:30,041 --> 00:19:31,416
Shut the fuck up, Cory.

468
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:34,916
I can't believe it took this long
for your true colors to shine through.

469
00:19:35,625 --> 00:19:37,958
Through that big, muscly exterior.

470
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:41,916
Get me the fuck out of here, Ricky,
right now.<i> </i>I am disgusted!

471
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,041
I like money too, man, but this is fucked.
You are fucked.

472
00:19:45,125 --> 00:19:46,875
Well, have fun tonguing Cyrus's new balls

473
00:19:46,958 --> 00:19:48,666
in your yellow Gay-rari. Dick.

474
00:19:50,875 --> 00:19:54,583
Finally, our two great minds
team up together.

475
00:19:54,666 --> 00:19:56,875
Those guys always held you back,
in my opinion.

476
00:19:56,958 --> 00:19:58,750
Really appreciate this opportunity,
brother.

477
00:19:58,833 --> 00:20:01,958
Man, I can't fucking wait to take
that fucking Ferrari for a rip, man.

478
00:20:02,041 --> 00:20:03,916
Fucking insane.
You're gonna fucking love it.

479
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:09,083
Oh, nice dick mobile!

480
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:13,250
That fucking asshole!
I can't fucking believe he did this to us.

481
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:14,958
Good morning, everyone.

482
00:20:15,041 --> 00:20:18,208
I had Randy get everyone together
because I have some good news.

483
00:20:18,291 --> 00:20:20,500
I promised to get your money back,
and I did.

484
00:20:21,666 --> 00:20:25,125
And all the people that were running
the call center are now in jail.

485
00:20:25,208 --> 00:20:26,625
Huh? How?

486
00:20:27,083 --> 00:20:29,416
Julian, what in the fuck happened?

487
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:32,750
Well, I was talking business with Cyrus,
trying to prove I was on his side,

488
00:20:32,833 --> 00:20:35,916
which was easy because he's stupid.
That's when it all went sideways for him.

489
00:20:36,958 --> 00:20:39,083
Man, the Canadian dollar's worth shit
right now.

490
00:20:39,166 --> 00:20:41,958
We hit the US and England,
we're gonna make way more money.

491
00:20:42,041 --> 00:20:43,000
I don't know.

492
00:20:43,083 --> 00:20:45,291
I think
we're doing fine right here locally.

493
00:20:45,375 --> 00:20:47,916
Yeah, but I feel kinda bad
ripping off Canadians, you know?

494
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,458
Hey, don't you go start growing
a fucking heart here, muscles.

495
00:20:50,541 --> 00:20:52,875
You'll never go anywhere
if you start giving a fuck about people.

496
00:20:52,958 --> 00:20:55,750
Yeah, you're right.
See, what the fuck am I thinking?

497
00:20:55,833 --> 00:20:58,208
I'm gonna be back in a sec.
I gotta rock a piss.

498
00:20:58,958 --> 00:21:00,125
[man over megaphone] <i>Police!</i>

-[shooting]
-Dennis, are you fucking nuts?

500
00:21:02,583 --> 00:21:04,416
Fucking hate the fucking cops, man!

501
00:21:04,583 --> 00:21:07,416
Fuck the cops! I can't go back to jail!

502
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:10,291
Boys, these are fucking cops! Fuck off!
You're going to get us--

503
00:21:10,375 --> 00:21:14,041
[screams] Fuck me! They fucked me.

504
00:21:14,125 --> 00:21:15,958
[Cyrus] They fucked me hard, man.
Fucking hurts!

505
00:21:16,041 --> 00:21:18,708
Dennis, I'm fucking hit! Fuck!

506
00:21:18,791 --> 00:21:20,958
-[banging]
-[Cyrus screaming]

507
00:21:21,041 --> 00:21:23,875
My brand-new seven-thousand-dollar balls!

508
00:21:25,208 --> 00:21:27,333
-We good?
-Yeah. You should probably

509
00:21:27,416 --> 00:21:31,083
-get the hell out of here.
-Oh, you! Motherfucker!

510
00:21:31,166 --> 00:21:32,208
[all cheering]

511
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:36,375
Not only did I get your money back,
but Cyrus got his new balls shot up.

512
00:21:36,458 --> 00:21:39,166
I can't believe he paid seven grand
for those fucking things.

513
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:40,166
What a dick.

514
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:42,375
I always believed in you, Julian.

515
00:21:42,458 --> 00:21:44,000
Shut the fuck up, Randy.

516
00:21:44,416 --> 00:21:47,791
I have ten thousand in cash up-front,
and for the rest of the money,

517
00:21:47,875 --> 00:21:50,666
we're just gonna sell this car.
It's worth close to 100 grand,

518
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:53,458
more than enough to cover
what everybody lost, okay?

519
00:21:53,541 --> 00:21:55,541
Plus, you know,
I'm gonna take a small commission.

520
00:21:55,625 --> 00:21:57,583
That's fair
'cause I'm selling the fucking thing.

521
00:21:57,708 --> 00:22:00,208
What in the flying ass cocks
is going on right now?

522
00:22:00,291 --> 00:22:04,833
I'll tell you what's going on, Ricky.
The scamm-ee became the scammer.

523
00:22:04,916 --> 00:22:09,000
[laughs] Julian set Cyrus up.
He fucking fooled all of us.

524
00:22:09,083 --> 00:22:10,250
Way to go, Julian.

525
00:22:10,333 --> 00:22:12,916
[laughs] Yeah, way to go, Julian.

526
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,416
It's like you gathered up everyone's cock
in Sunnyvale, then you bundled them,

527
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:20,000
then you shoved that one big super cock
right through Cyrus's nut sack.

528
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:23,000
-Ricky…
-What?

529
00:22:23,083 --> 00:22:24,875
Don't make analogies anymore.

530
00:22:25,333 --> 00:22:29,833
I'm officially declaring today
Sunnyvale Day! People tried

531
00:22:29,916 --> 00:22:32,500
-to fuck with our park, and we won!
-[crowd cheering]

532
00:22:32,916 --> 00:22:36,291
I can't believe you guys actually thought
that I might partner up with Cyrus.

533
00:22:36,375 --> 00:22:38,041
You're, like, a really good actor, Julian.

534
00:22:38,125 --> 00:22:42,333
Yeah, maybe all those years of jacking it
to Stallone, and Arnie, and the Swayz,

535
00:22:42,416 --> 00:22:43,500
maybe have paid off.

536
00:22:43,583 --> 00:22:44,708
Yeah, real funny, Bubs.

537
00:22:44,791 --> 00:22:47,666
[laughs] You better not ever
put me through that again, Julian.

538
00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:48,666
Sorry, boys.

539
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:51,750
When I found out we were fucked,
I knew it was our only fucking play.

540
00:22:51,833 --> 00:22:53,916
Jesus, I thought you guys
were gonna pick up on it.

541
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,125
No, we didn't have a fucking clue.
It's like you're fucking Robert De Miro.

542
00:22:57,208 --> 00:23:01,583
The important thing is, it all worked out,
we won, and we all kinda did it together.

543
00:23:01,666 --> 00:23:05,875
No, I'm-- I'm giving you this one, Julian.
This was all you.

544
00:23:05,958 --> 00:23:09,833
I can't believe I doubted you, actually.
Get over here, you big, muscly bastard.

545
00:23:09,916 --> 00:23:10,833
You too, Ricky.

546
00:23:11,875 --> 00:23:14,458
[farts]
Oh, fuck. You just jarred something loose.

547
00:23:14,541 --> 00:23:15,791
No, Ricky. [groans]

548
00:23:15,875 --> 00:23:17,000
Burnt us, Ricky.

549
00:23:17,083 --> 00:23:20,000
Okay, Ricky.
This diet of yours, it's fucking over!

550
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:21,750
For fuck's sakes.

551
00:23:22,083 --> 00:23:23,625
I think the cork finally popped.

552
00:23:23,708 --> 00:23:27,375
Okay, so just so we're clear,
you mean you just shit yourself, correct?

553
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:29,375
Big time. Mix me up another drink.

554
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:31,833
Have to get cleaned up.
Bubs, gotta use your hose, man.

555
00:23:33,083 --> 00:23:36,541
No, problem, Ricky. Turn the nozzle
to "jet," and you should be good.

556
00:23:36,666 --> 00:23:37,500
Love you, bud.

557
00:23:37,583 --> 00:23:40,166
[softly] Oh, that feels good.
[shouting] Love you too, buddy!

558
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:47,250
[piano theme music playing]

559
00:24:43,416 --> 00:24:45,416
[seagulls cawing]

560
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:47,500
[waves splashing]

561
00:24:47,583 --> 00:24:49,583
[engine chugging]

562
00:24:58,875 --> 00:25:04,333
[all] Oh fuck!

563
00:25:04,416 --> 00:25:06,000
[man] Jesus Christ!

564
00:25:12,041 --> 00:25:13,250
[man whispers] Fuck off.
1
00:00:14,791 --> 00:00:17,375
Let's see you leak on me now,
you caulk-sucker.

2
00:00:17,458 --> 00:00:18,291
[laughs]

3
00:00:18,375 --> 00:00:21,750
Get it? I'm caulking the window,
and I just called it a caulk-sucker.

4
00:00:21,833 --> 00:00:24,000
You know, not the C-O-C-K sucker,

5
00:00:24,083 --> 00:00:25,958
the C-A-U-L-K sucker.

6
00:00:26,041 --> 00:00:27,166
[laughs]

7
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:29,416
My fuck, I love caulk…

8
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:30,333
ing.

9
00:00:30,416 --> 00:00:31,791
[laughs]

10
00:00:31,875 --> 00:00:34,416
[cat meowing]

11
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:37,583
Oh, my fuck.
Why are you low-riding, Limp Bizkit?

12
00:00:37,666 --> 00:00:38,500
[kitten meows]

13
00:00:38,583 --> 00:00:41,541
Come here, boy. Please tell me
you got something in your back paws.

14
00:00:41,625 --> 00:00:43,083
Please tell me you got a burdock

15
00:00:43,166 --> 00:00:44,666
-or a splinter.
-[kitten purrs]

16
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:48,208
Well, here we fucking go.
You've got fucking dirty, old arse worms

17
00:00:48,291 --> 00:00:50,583
coming out of you
like a Play-Doh Fun Factory.

18
00:00:50,666 --> 00:00:54,041
[piano theme music playing]

19
00:00:58,958 --> 00:01:01,875
[licking]

20
00:01:05,416 --> 00:01:07,583
Somebody's having a good time
with himself.

21
00:01:07,666 --> 00:01:09,791
What happened to his cock?
Why is his knob missing?

22
00:01:09,875 --> 00:01:12,416
That must have been fucking painful. What?

23
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:16,000
Dogs don't have knobs like humans.
They got fucking lipstick tubes.

24
00:01:16,083 --> 00:01:17,416
Mind your own goddamn business.

25
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:20,458
Okay, just look away.
You're staring at a fucking dog's cock!

26
00:01:20,541 --> 00:01:22,625
-I can't help it. Listen to this shit.
-[slurping]

27
00:01:22,708 --> 00:01:25,166
Listen to the licking and sucking,
it's fucking ridiculous.

28
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:27,583
Don't you be blowing your dog load
all over my leg, either.

29
00:01:27,666 --> 00:01:30,208
Ricky, that's enough.
Let go of that fucking thing.

30
00:01:30,958 --> 00:01:32,541
Thank you. It's about fucking time.

31
00:01:32,625 --> 00:01:35,416
I can't believe you're shooting
your lips off in the first place.

32
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:37,625
I know
if you could lick your balls in public,

33
00:01:37,708 --> 00:01:40,333
-you'd be fucking doing it right now.
-Bullshit.

34
00:01:40,416 --> 00:01:41,916
-[cat purring]
-Well, maybe.

35
00:01:42,333 --> 00:01:43,291
[woman] Bubbles?

36
00:01:43,375 --> 00:01:44,291
That's me.

37
00:01:44,375 --> 00:01:46,416
The doctor's ready
to see Limp Bizkit now.

38
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,375
Sure you don't want to sneak in
this knobless dog

39
00:01:48,458 --> 00:01:50,916
-that's about to blow his load?
-Ricky, come on, get in here.

40
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,458
What is wrong with you?

41
00:01:52,875 --> 00:01:53,791
[whispering] Wow.

42
00:01:54,166 --> 00:01:55,458
What do you mean, wow?

43
00:01:55,791 --> 00:01:57,250
That can't be a good "wow."

44
00:01:57,541 --> 00:02:01,250
-Isn't it just worms? Worms get a wow?
-The worms I had definitely get a wow.

45
00:02:01,333 --> 00:02:04,375
It's not just a worm, he's got hookworms.
Much more dangerous.

46
00:02:04,458 --> 00:02:06,333
-[kitten meowing]
-What kind of more dangerous?

47
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:09,708
Hookworms basically eat away
at the stomach lining and intestine.

48
00:02:09,791 --> 00:02:12,708
It could be fatal for kittens,
if not treated and they could spread.

49
00:02:12,791 --> 00:02:16,208
Fatal. Okay, that's it.
Let's get this treated before it spreads.

50
00:02:16,291 --> 00:02:17,583
I agree, my ass is getting itchy

51
00:02:17,666 --> 00:02:20,541
-just looking at these bastards.
-Get your fingers out of your hole.

52
00:02:21,041 --> 00:02:22,250
How much for the treatment?

53
00:02:22,333 --> 00:02:24,958
It'll be a few days
of boarding, medication.

54
00:02:25,041 --> 00:02:27,041
You're looking
at seventeen hundred dollars.

55
00:02:27,125 --> 00:02:28,958
-[all] Seventeen?
-Seventeen hundred bucks!

56
00:02:29,041 --> 00:02:31,208
What the fuck!
That's quite a chunk of change.

57
00:02:31,291 --> 00:02:33,625
I got rid of mine
with a blowtorch and a screwdriver.

58
00:02:33,708 --> 00:02:36,000
You can't use a blowtorch on a kitty!

59
00:02:36,083 --> 00:02:37,000
If you shaved him.

60
00:02:37,083 --> 00:02:39,583
Where in the fuck
am I gonna get this kind of money?

61
00:02:39,666 --> 00:02:41,375
I don't know. What do you want to do here?

62
00:02:41,458 --> 00:02:43,208
I want <i>you</i> to fucking figure it out!

63
00:02:43,291 --> 00:02:45,583
You're the one with all the plans.
Get planning.

64
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:47,875
[tires squeal]

65
00:02:49,125 --> 00:02:52,000
[Ricky] I can't fucking believe
we're back here again.

66
00:02:52,291 --> 00:02:54,500
Sam, you here, you cockless cave quiff?

67
00:02:54,583 --> 00:02:56,458
Sam, it's us. You back there?

68
00:02:56,791 --> 00:02:59,416
Hey, boys. How are my buddies doing today?

69
00:03:00,833 --> 00:03:02,250
Good, man. How about you?

70
00:03:02,333 --> 00:03:04,208
Never been better, Julian.

71
00:03:04,291 --> 00:03:07,166
I've got a new partner,
who's unbelievable in the sack,

72
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:09,291
business is great, making money.

73
00:03:09,375 --> 00:03:10,291
Life is perfect.

74
00:03:10,625 --> 00:03:12,500
So, what can I do for my friends today?

75
00:03:12,583 --> 00:03:14,833
-My kitty has hookworms, Sam.
-[kitten meowing]

76
00:03:14,916 --> 00:03:17,125
Aw, hookworms? Poor little guy.

77
00:03:17,208 --> 00:03:20,375
Those are nasty little fuckers,
especially for kittens.

78
00:03:20,458 --> 00:03:22,250
Don't worry, little buddy.

79
00:03:22,333 --> 00:03:24,791
-Uncle Sammy will fix you right up.
-[kitten purring]

80
00:03:24,875 --> 00:03:25,708
You will?

81
00:03:26,416 --> 00:03:28,416
Are you on some kind of happy pill, Sam?

82
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:31,541
'Cause, no offense,
but you're usually a nasty prick.

83
00:03:31,625 --> 00:03:34,166
No, I'm in love, and you're in luck.

84
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:37,666
I had an overshipment of drugs years ago,
and it's taking up space.

85
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:40,083
[laughs] I'm starting to feel
like a freaking hoarder!

86
00:03:40,166 --> 00:03:42,083
-[Sam laughing]
-[rest laugh nervously]

87
00:03:42,166 --> 00:03:43,000
-What the fuck?
-[crashing]

88
00:03:43,083 --> 00:03:44,208
-Down! Everybody down!

89
00:03:44,291 --> 00:03:45,666
-Fuck off.
-We're down!

90
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:47,541
-I'm down--
-We did nothing.

91
00:03:47,625 --> 00:03:48,458
We're not armed!

92
00:03:48,541 --> 00:03:50,166
Hands on your head. You're under arrest!

93
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:52,375
I didn't do nothing!
What the fuck did I do, Officer?

94
00:03:52,458 --> 00:03:54,416
Illegal trafficking of human testicles.

95
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:55,666
You sick fuck!

96
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:57,541
[clattering and footsteps]

97
00:03:58,583 --> 00:04:01,833
One fucking time
I see Sam actually being nice to us,

98
00:04:01,916 --> 00:04:04,250
and he gets arrested
selling balls on Amazon.

99
00:04:04,333 --> 00:04:05,875
There's only one other option.

100
00:04:05,958 --> 00:04:08,041
Ricky, get us the fuck out of here. Fast!

101
00:04:08,125 --> 00:04:12,875
-Nice. Faster than the curious.
-[sirens]

102
00:04:13,958 --> 00:04:14,958
[brakes screech]

103
00:04:15,041 --> 00:04:16,125
[glove box opens]

104
00:04:17,833 --> 00:04:19,583
What're you doing?
Are we doin' this or what?

105
00:04:19,666 --> 00:04:22,000
Look at your gas needle.
It's on <i>E,</i> dummy.

106
00:04:22,083 --> 00:04:24,708
It doesn't even work. I can tell
there's gas by how the car feels.

107
00:04:24,833 --> 00:04:27,791
None of it works. Says I've been out
of oil for 6 months. It still runs great.

108
00:04:27,875 --> 00:04:28,791
You can't tell shit.

109
00:04:28,875 --> 00:04:31,125
Listen, we're gonna fill up
your fucking car with gas,

110
00:04:31,208 --> 00:04:33,958
rob the place, and that way,
we're not gonna fucking run out

111
00:04:34,041 --> 00:04:35,333
trying to get away from here.

112
00:04:35,416 --> 00:04:38,000
Look who's in love with gas
all of a sudden. Let's marry some gas.

113
00:04:38,083 --> 00:04:40,208
-Fuck you, Ricky.
-Just hold the fuck on here.

114
00:04:40,291 --> 00:04:42,875
You can't just waltz into a gas station
and rob it.

115
00:04:42,958 --> 00:04:45,125
-Why not?
-Because it's fucked, Ricky.

116
00:04:45,208 --> 00:04:47,166
But this place is easy.
People rob it all the time.

117
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:48,666
What's that, Limp Bizkit?

118
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:50,291
No, you heard it right, yeah.

119
00:04:50,375 --> 00:04:52,791
We're about to rob a fucking gas station

120
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:55,166
for your ass worms, like it's no big deal.

121
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:58,583
Just another fucking thing
we do on a regular basis.

122
00:04:58,666 --> 00:05:01,625
-[tires squeal]
-[gunshot]

123
00:05:01,708 --> 00:05:02,541
Fuck's sakes!

124
00:05:02,625 --> 00:05:04,750
-That fucking greaseball beat us to it.
-[heavy thud]

125
00:05:04,833 --> 00:05:06,375
-Give me the fucking money.
-[screams]

126
00:05:06,458 --> 00:05:08,500
Please don't hurt me!
Take it. It's all they had.

127
00:05:08,583 --> 00:05:10,708
Oh, man, there's not even 100 bucks here.

128
00:05:10,791 --> 00:05:11,833
Let me go, please!

129
00:05:11,916 --> 00:05:13,833
I don't want to go to jail!
I'm on house arrest.

130
00:05:13,916 --> 00:05:17,458
Jesus Christ, pal. You wouldn't do well
in jail. Go on, beat it.

131
00:05:17,541 --> 00:05:18,416
Thank you, sir.

132
00:05:19,208 --> 00:05:22,666
My name's Brogan McSweeney.
I've got to tell you, that was impressive.

133
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:25,125
Yeah, it would have been impressive
if he had more money.

134
00:05:25,208 --> 00:05:27,541
-An actor, are you?
-What? An actor?

135
00:05:27,625 --> 00:05:29,583
I see the camera fellas there.

136
00:05:29,666 --> 00:05:32,041
-Was this whole thing staged?
-No, man.

137
00:05:32,125 --> 00:05:34,541
They're just following me around,
documenting my life.

138
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:37,166
-Ah, it's a shame.
-Oh, yeah? Why is that?

139
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:39,458
I'm producing
the new Clint Eatswood movie in town.

140
00:05:39,541 --> 00:05:40,791
You've got the look we need.

141
00:05:40,875 --> 00:05:43,833
Are you fucking kidding me?
Clint's shooting a movie in town?

142
00:05:43,916 --> 00:05:46,166
-He's directing it, yeah.
-Oh man, I'm a huge fan.

143
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:48,916
I always wanted to be
in a Clint-Arnie-Stallone kind of movie.

144
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:49,916
What's this one about?

145
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,500
Stop trying to pick up Australian dudes.
Let's get out of here.

146
00:05:52,583 --> 00:05:55,250
-I'm fucking Irish, man.
-Shut the fuck up, Ricky.

147
00:05:55,333 --> 00:05:58,333
It's a wrestling movie starring Sledge.
You ever heard of him?

148
00:05:58,416 --> 00:06:00,000
What? Sledge, the wrestler?

149
00:06:00,083 --> 00:06:01,875
Seven-time world heavyweight champ?

150
00:06:01,958 --> 00:06:04,083
No, never fucking heard of him before!

151
00:06:04,166 --> 00:06:06,708
Oh, my God!
I'd do anything to be in that movie.

152
00:06:06,791 --> 00:06:08,833
Well,
we can always use background performers,

153
00:06:08,916 --> 00:06:11,125
so if you'd like to be in it,
bring your friends.

154
00:06:11,208 --> 00:06:12,625
Oh, my God, are you serious?

155
00:06:12,958 --> 00:06:16,875
Boys, we're gonna be in a wrestling movie
with the Sledge!

156
00:06:16,958 --> 00:06:18,625
Here's the address. See you in an hour.

157
00:06:20,291 --> 00:06:21,458
According to the internet,

158
00:06:21,541 --> 00:06:24,541
background actors can make
up to 200 bucks for the day.

159
00:06:24,625 --> 00:06:26,583
And Julian, if he gets a speaking role,

160
00:06:26,666 --> 00:06:29,125
he could make fucking 12 hundred big ones.

161
00:06:29,208 --> 00:06:31,916
He said every penny's coming to me,
towards my kitty.

162
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,791
We heard the news, and we're in, dude.

163
00:06:33,875 --> 00:06:36,416
This sounds exciting.
I'm good at playing pretendies.

164
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:39,833
-Yeah, dude, anything for kitties.
-Two high fives coming at you.

165
00:06:39,916 --> 00:06:43,375
Nothing better than your whole family
coming together to save the day.

166
00:06:43,458 --> 00:06:44,458
Thanks, fellas.

167
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:51,375
Okay, boys, remember when I told you
anything over a three-second hug is weird?

168
00:06:51,458 --> 00:06:52,291
Yeah, I do.

169
00:06:52,375 --> 00:06:55,500
You're five seconds over.
You gotta count, boys.

170
00:06:56,458 --> 00:06:58,958
Stand still, Cory. Don't flinch, Jacob.

171
00:06:59,041 --> 00:07:01,250
-[punching]
-Oh, devastating!

172
00:07:01,333 --> 00:07:03,125
[Cory and Jacob groaning]

173
00:07:03,208 --> 00:07:06,166
Wow, you fellas are really taking
this acting thing serious.

174
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:08,750
Brogan McSweeney said
this could start my movie career, man.

175
00:07:08,833 --> 00:07:09,958
Brogan McSweeney?

176
00:07:10,041 --> 00:07:12,583
The Brogan McSweeney? Clint's producer?

177
00:07:12,666 --> 00:07:13,625
Oh, my frig!

178
00:07:14,416 --> 00:07:16,333
I love all of Clint's movies.

179
00:07:16,416 --> 00:07:18,083
They're so real and lifelike.

180
00:07:18,666 --> 00:07:20,291
Since when are you into Clint?

181
00:07:20,375 --> 00:07:21,833
Since when are <i>you,</i> Julian?

182
00:07:21,916 --> 00:07:23,833
Since my entire life, dickhead.

183
00:07:23,916 --> 00:07:26,833
Are you sure I can't come?
I can background act, too, guys.

184
00:07:27,291 --> 00:07:30,375
I really need you to look after LB, Randy.
Please.

185
00:07:30,458 --> 00:07:32,833
Can't Trin and Sarah
look after this little guy?

186
00:07:32,916 --> 00:07:34,083
Just a heads-up, guys.

187
00:07:34,166 --> 00:07:36,791
If you bring that cute,
hookworm-infested creature

188
00:07:36,875 --> 00:07:38,416
anywhere near this trailer,

189
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,333
I'm gonna knock you the fuck out!

190
00:07:40,416 --> 00:07:41,500
No offense, Bubbles.

191
00:07:41,583 --> 00:07:43,958
No offense, Randy,
but you're not being in the fucking movie.

192
00:07:44,041 --> 00:07:45,166
You look like walrus's shit,

193
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:47,416
you smell like a moose's bag,
and you're dumb as a dead trout

194
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:49,250
that wasn't even that smart
when it was lived.

195
00:07:49,333 --> 00:07:51,250
-That's not very frigging nice.
-Fuck you.

196
00:07:51,333 --> 00:07:53,458
No, boys, stop that shit. Okay, it's time.

197
00:07:53,541 --> 00:07:55,583
-Let's go become movie stars.
-[Cory] Yeah!

198
00:07:58,958 --> 00:08:01,666
Boys, I don't get freaked out too often,
but holy fuck.

199
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:05,333
-I'm gonna be in a Clint Eastwood movie.
-With your two best friends.

200
00:08:05,416 --> 00:08:08,583
-Well, four best friends, right, dude?
-And my two best friends.

201
00:08:08,666 --> 00:08:09,916
I fucking love you guys.

202
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,791
-Love you too, Julian.
-Yeah, man.

203
00:08:11,875 --> 00:08:15,583
Yo, dude, I'm not the best at counting,
but that's got to be three seconds.

204
00:08:15,666 --> 00:08:16,833
No talking, Cory.

205
00:08:17,416 --> 00:08:18,958
-[Ricky] Yeah!
-[Bubbles] Fancy.

206
00:08:19,041 --> 00:08:22,083
Brogan will be right with you.
Help yourself to the food and beverages.

207
00:08:22,166 --> 00:08:24,291
Oh, my God, dudes, it's a dream come true!

208
00:08:24,375 --> 00:08:26,375
[singing] <i>Jacob, step back,</i>
<i>Free Pop-Tarts!</i>

209
00:08:26,458 --> 00:08:27,458
<i>Pop-Tarts for me!</i>

210
00:08:27,541 --> 00:08:29,041
Oh, I'd love a Pop-Tart.

211
00:08:29,125 --> 00:08:31,125
I haven't eaten in six days.

212
00:08:31,208 --> 00:08:33,291
Hang on now, guys. Which one is Julian?

213
00:08:33,375 --> 00:08:36,416
-Me.
-This food is for speaking cast only.

214
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:39,125
Hi, I'm Randy Lahey, Julian's manager.

215
00:08:39,208 --> 00:08:43,416
This here is Cory Trevorson.
He's doing security.

216
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:45,583
The other two, I'm not sure
who the fuck they are.

217
00:08:45,666 --> 00:08:46,958
I'm Jacob. This is Cory.

218
00:08:47,041 --> 00:08:49,166
We're in something called background?

219
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:52,208
Okay guys, I'll have to take you down
to background holding.

220
00:08:52,291 --> 00:08:53,375
Come with me, please.

221
00:08:53,791 --> 00:08:55,250
Put the food down.

222
00:08:55,541 --> 00:08:56,416
Spit that out!

223
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:57,583
[both spitting]

224
00:08:57,666 --> 00:08:59,791
Nice going, Ricky. Fucking management?

225
00:08:59,875 --> 00:09:01,208
We might not get paid now.

226
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:03,500
We're gonna have to take
our money's worth in food, then.

227
00:09:03,583 --> 00:09:06,000
This isn't about you getting
your money's worth of food,

228
00:09:06,083 --> 00:09:08,583
it's about getting cash
to save my kitty's life!

229
00:09:08,666 --> 00:09:09,875
Nice, look at that.

230
00:09:09,958 --> 00:09:11,500
Good to see you getting into character.

231
00:09:11,583 --> 00:09:14,666
Uh, yes, sir,
that was all acting right there.

232
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:16,666
Taking this one hundred percent serious.

233
00:09:17,041 --> 00:09:18,291
When do we meet Sledge?

234
00:09:18,375 --> 00:09:20,166
We'll be ready for you on set
in five minutes.

235
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:21,416
Fucking right on.

236
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:24,166
Great job on the cheese sandwiches, too.

237
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:27,083
Okay, guys, you may as well get naked
and work up a pump.

238
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,250
We'll be shooting your scene soon,

239
00:09:29,333 --> 00:09:31,541
so, if you could come to set hard,
it'd be great.

240
00:09:32,166 --> 00:09:33,916
Uh, why is everyone naked, dude?

241
00:09:34,041 --> 00:09:34,875
I don't know.

242
00:09:35,166 --> 00:09:36,750
And why do we have to get hard?

243
00:09:36,833 --> 00:09:37,666
I don't know.

244
00:09:38,458 --> 00:09:39,958
Uh, excuse me, guys.

245
00:09:40,041 --> 00:09:43,625
I think we left something…
important out in the car.

246
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:45,458
Yeah, we did for sure, dudes.

247
00:09:45,958 --> 00:09:47,958
[rock music playing]

248
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:52,083
[Bubbles] Oh, my fuck,
look at the way he works the ring.

249
00:09:52,666 --> 00:09:53,833
What a professional.

250
00:09:53,916 --> 00:09:55,416
He's something else, isn't he?

251
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:58,083
Method acting.
Taking it seriously, Brando-style.

252
00:09:58,166 --> 00:10:01,750
And he is gonna be counting on you
big-time, Julian. Big-time.

253
00:10:01,833 --> 00:10:04,583
No problem.What do you want me to do?
Do I get a script?

254
00:10:04,666 --> 00:10:07,375
So, I told Clint
about that little incident today,

255
00:10:07,458 --> 00:10:09,791
and he wants it to be raw.
He wants it to be natural.

256
00:10:09,875 --> 00:10:11,458
So, just use your instincts, man.

257
00:10:11,541 --> 00:10:13,041
Get in there, show us wrestling moves.

258
00:10:13,666 --> 00:10:15,083
Wrestling moves? [laughs]

259
00:10:15,166 --> 00:10:18,083
I don't know any wrestling moves.
I can <i>fight</i> fight, though.

260
00:10:18,166 --> 00:10:20,541
Green Bastard knows
all the wrestling moves, sir.

261
00:10:20,625 --> 00:10:24,166
Piledriver, backbreaker, facebuster,

262
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:27,541
DDT, high-fly off the ropes.
I know everything.

263
00:10:27,625 --> 00:10:29,750
That's okay, Bubs,
I think I can figure this out, man.

264
00:10:30,166 --> 00:10:31,083
Fucking perfect.

265
00:10:31,166 --> 00:10:33,666
I'll hold your drink. You get in there
and show us what you got.

266
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:35,458
-[Julian objects]
-Is there a problem here?

267
00:10:35,541 --> 00:10:37,666
Do not touch the drink. The drink stays.

268
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:40,250
Uh, it might be an insurance
or a creative problem.

269
00:10:40,333 --> 00:10:41,166
You sure about that?

270
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:43,833
Yeah, one hundred percent sure.
It's a deal-breaker, actually.

271
00:10:43,916 --> 00:10:47,583
Look, I think we should talk to Clint
about this. Follow me.

272
00:10:48,416 --> 00:10:51,500
Bubs, what the fuck was that all about?
"I can do all these wrestling moves."

273
00:10:51,583 --> 00:10:53,916
What? Are you trying to crush
my fucking dreams here, man?

274
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,291
I can do all the fucking moves,
and you can't.

275
00:10:56,666 --> 00:10:59,041
Sorry, it was the Green Bastard talking,
but he…

276
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:02,583
said, because he knows he has
far superior skills to you in the ring.

277
00:11:02,666 --> 00:11:06,458
It's not just about big muscles, you know.
There's skill involved.

278
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:08,041
We need to talk to you about this movie.

279
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:10,000
Yeah, we saw naked men.

280
00:11:10,083 --> 00:11:12,708
They were shiny and oiled up.
They looked good and everything, but…

281
00:11:12,791 --> 00:11:14,791
It's a wrestling movie, you fucking dummy!

282
00:11:14,875 --> 00:11:16,916
Get the fuck out of my way.
We're about to meet Clint.

283
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,583
{\an8}Julian, I'd like you to meet Clint.

284
00:11:18,666 --> 00:11:20,958
Clint, this is the guy
I was telling you about.

285
00:11:21,041 --> 00:11:22,375
Julian, Clint. Clint, Julian.

286
00:11:22,458 --> 00:11:23,750
Whoa, holy shit!

287
00:11:24,208 --> 00:11:26,958
Sorry, sir, I just kinda thought
you were a little bit taller.

288
00:11:27,041 --> 00:11:29,000
Back in my acting days,

289
00:11:29,083 --> 00:11:30,541
I would've made your day…

290
00:11:30,875 --> 00:11:31,708
punk.

291
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:33,083
-Huh?
-So, he wants to keep

292
00:11:33,166 --> 00:11:35,625
the drink in the shot.
Is that a problem, sir?

293
00:11:35,708 --> 00:11:39,833
Well, it might be a continuity nightmare
with the spillage.

294
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:42,583
Oh, look, if he can't do it,
I sure as fuck can!

295
00:11:42,666 --> 00:11:44,166
Green Bastard from parts unknown.

296
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:46,333
-Nice to meet you, sir.
-Bubs, that's enough.

297
00:11:46,416 --> 00:11:48,250
I won't spill a drop, sir, I promise.

298
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:50,833
-Okay, let's give it a shot then.
-[bell rings]

299
00:11:50,916 --> 00:11:53,833
Okay, folks, we're gonna roll.
Quiet, please!

300
00:11:53,916 --> 00:11:54,791
Okay.

301
00:11:55,208 --> 00:11:58,125
I really want to feel this from the heart,
guys.

302
00:11:58,416 --> 00:11:59,416
Rolling!

303
00:12:00,083 --> 00:12:02,416
[funky music playing]

304
00:12:03,166 --> 00:12:05,000
I can't fight you like this anymore.

305
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:06,208
I can't fight…

306
00:12:06,458 --> 00:12:07,708
my love for you.

307
00:12:07,875 --> 00:12:10,416
{\an8}What? Your love for me? [groans]

308
00:12:10,791 --> 00:12:12,791
{\an8}Oh, my God, Ricky, look at the name.

309
00:12:13,416 --> 00:12:14,958
{\an8}What? Clint Eastwood.

310
00:12:15,041 --> 00:12:17,208
{\an8}No, separate the words, Ricky.

311
00:12:17,458 --> 00:12:18,583
{\an8}"Eats wood."

312
00:12:18,708 --> 00:12:20,750
{\an8}Oh, my fuck, I get it. [laughs]

313
00:12:20,833 --> 00:12:22,500
{\an8}Isn't that like a gay porn name?

314
00:12:22,583 --> 00:12:24,750
{\an8}-Yes, it's a gay porn name!
-What is?

315
00:12:24,833 --> 00:12:27,625
{\an8}Ricky, they're making a gay porno movie
right now!

316
00:12:27,708 --> 00:12:29,375
{\an8}-Where?
-In front of us!

317
00:12:29,458 --> 00:12:31,083
{\an8}This is a gay porno set!

318
00:12:31,166 --> 00:12:33,333
{\an8}We tried to tell you, dudes!

319
00:12:33,416 --> 00:12:35,125
[groaning and slapping]

320
00:12:35,208 --> 00:12:36,250
Don't fight it.

321
00:12:36,333 --> 00:12:39,125
I need to feel your warm body
on top of mine.

322
00:12:39,208 --> 00:12:42,291
Whoa, don't fucking touch me.
What the fuck are you doing, man?

323
00:12:42,375 --> 00:12:44,625
Okay, I've had enough.
I need a break here.

324
00:12:44,708 --> 00:12:46,375
A break from our relationship?

325
00:12:46,458 --> 00:12:48,791
But I feel like
it's just starting to burn.

326
00:12:48,875 --> 00:12:52,083
Okay, I'm done here. I'm done.
I don't know what the fuck's going on.

327
00:12:52,166 --> 00:12:53,583
Cut! Check the gate!

328
00:12:53,666 --> 00:12:55,875
That was beautiful. So real.

329
00:12:56,166 --> 00:12:57,375
We got that one.

330
00:12:57,833 --> 00:12:59,458
[rustling]

331
00:12:59,541 --> 00:13:00,916
Oh, my fuck, boys.

332
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,333
I almost feel bad about how much more food
I'm about to eat.

333
00:13:03,416 --> 00:13:06,041
Listen, Bubs, I know acting with Sledge
is a dream of yours,

334
00:13:06,125 --> 00:13:08,458
and you do know a shit-ton
of wrestling moves.

335
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:11,291
-I want to make that happen for you, bud.
-Oh, is that right?

336
00:13:11,375 --> 00:13:13,125
-You wanna make my dreams come true?
-Yeah.

337
00:13:13,208 --> 00:13:16,125
And it's got nothing to do with the fact
that you just realized

338
00:13:16,208 --> 00:13:18,125
you're starring in a gay porno film?

339
00:13:18,208 --> 00:13:21,083
Julian, nice scene!
I really felt it out there with you, man.

340
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,583
Sledge, I don't know how to ask you this,
but--

341
00:13:23,666 --> 00:13:26,500
How did I transition from wrestling
to acting?

342
00:13:26,583 --> 00:13:30,166
It's a long story,
but it happened right after my injury.

343
00:13:30,625 --> 00:13:34,250
I went to a very dark place,
and after years of debauchery,

344
00:13:34,333 --> 00:13:38,208
I found myself in a high-stakes
celebrity game of Dungeons & Dragons

345
00:13:38,291 --> 00:13:39,958
to alleviate the depression, and… [sighs]

346
00:13:40,041 --> 00:13:42,458
well, find the thrill
that was gone from my life.

347
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:45,125
[Sledge] Unfortunately,
I bet my entire life savings

348
00:13:45,208 --> 00:13:49,250
against David Hasselhoff, Chevy Chase,
Betty White, and Bananarama…

349
00:13:49,708 --> 00:13:51,000
and lost.

350
00:13:51,083 --> 00:13:52,791
Come on! Bananarama?

351
00:13:52,875 --> 00:13:55,791
Huh, yeah.
And that led to Betty White interfering

352
00:13:55,875 --> 00:13:58,125
with an unsuccessful four-way
with Bananarama

353
00:13:58,208 --> 00:14:01,041
and me being forced into a short career
in Turkish ditch fighting.

354
00:14:01,125 --> 00:14:03,750
-[gentle piano music playing]
-I hit rock bottom, guys.

355
00:14:03,833 --> 00:14:06,875
That's when I saw Clint's ad in the paper.
Pretty fucked up, huh?

356
00:14:07,333 --> 00:14:11,000
Well, yeah, but I was kinda talking
about the type of movie this is.

357
00:14:11,083 --> 00:14:13,750
A soft gay porn?
Well, look, it's no different

358
00:14:13,833 --> 00:14:16,333
than Michael C. Hall
kissing men in <i>Six Feet Under,</i>

359
00:14:16,416 --> 00:14:18,041
<i>Brokeback Mountain, Shameless.</i>

360
00:14:18,125 --> 00:14:19,583
None of those guys are gay.

361
00:14:19,666 --> 00:14:21,041
I'm not gay either.

362
00:14:21,125 --> 00:14:23,791
We could all get
our big non-gay break from this.

363
00:14:23,875 --> 00:14:26,625
Man, I don't know, man.
I don't know if I could do this.

364
00:14:26,875 --> 00:14:29,666
It'll be easy.
I just have to come up from behind you

365
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:30,916
and pretend I'm going in.

366
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,375
Oh, my fuck.

367
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:34,875
No, it's not so bad.

368
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:37,083
I just think about things
that get me hard,

369
00:14:37,166 --> 00:14:40,250
throw on a cock sock,
and slide along your taint a little bit.

370
00:14:40,333 --> 00:14:43,041
You just have to get in character, man.
It's art.

371
00:14:43,125 --> 00:14:45,000
Okay, I'm out. I can't do this, Bubs.

372
00:14:45,083 --> 00:14:46,875
I was only doing this for your kitty.

373
00:14:46,958 --> 00:14:49,125
-This is too much, though.
-Julian, please!

374
00:14:49,208 --> 00:14:52,375
Hey, you're gonna have to take my place.
You are the Green Bastard, aren't ya?

375
00:14:52,458 --> 00:14:54,041
-The Green Bastard?
-[slapping]

376
00:14:54,125 --> 00:14:55,000
[Bubbles] Whoa, now!

377
00:14:55,083 --> 00:14:57,500
[groans] This actually might be better.

378
00:14:57,583 --> 00:14:59,458
Well, just hang on. Wait, now.

379
00:14:59,541 --> 00:15:02,541
-I'll go talk to Clint.
-Boys, I really don't think I can do this.

380
00:15:02,625 --> 00:15:05,583
I don't think I can pretend to be gay
for my kitty.

381
00:15:05,666 --> 00:15:08,083
[whimpering] I'm so conflicted.

382
00:15:08,166 --> 00:15:10,958
Am I a horrible, terrible father?
[whimpers]

383
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:15,291
-[Randy] Come here, pussy.
-[scraping metal]

384
00:15:15,375 --> 00:15:17,375
Poor little guy.
He must be so uncomfortable.

385
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:21,416
Randy, he's gonna rub his little arse
right down to the bone. Get him down!

386
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:25,250
-Psst, here, Limpy. Come to Uncle Randers.
-[kitten meows]

387
00:15:25,333 --> 00:15:26,916
This is no frigging use.

388
00:15:27,208 --> 00:15:29,458
He frigging hates me. Psst.

389
00:15:29,541 --> 00:15:30,500
Oh, here he comes.

390
00:15:30,958 --> 00:15:31,833
That's it, Limpy.

391
00:15:32,541 --> 00:15:33,458
-Come here.
-[hissing]

392
00:15:33,541 --> 00:15:35,666
[screaming] Frig! That stings!

393
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:37,625
-[cat hissing]
-[loud thuds]

394
00:15:37,708 --> 00:15:39,541
[yells] Frig! It stings!

395
00:15:39,958 --> 00:15:41,791
That's it. We're calling Bubbles.

396
00:15:41,875 --> 00:15:44,500
Randy, just spread a little cottage cheese
on a cracker,

397
00:15:44,583 --> 00:15:46,625
and he'll be all over it
like stink on a monkey.

398
00:15:46,708 --> 00:15:48,916
Oh, and if you see
an old diaper of Mo's kicking around,

399
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,125
put that on him,
in case he gets the shits.

400
00:15:51,375 --> 00:15:53,541
-I'll be there as soon as I can.
-[phone beeps]

401
00:15:53,625 --> 00:15:56,625
I never thought I'd ever utter these words
in my life, but…

402
00:15:56,708 --> 00:15:59,708
looks like I'm gonna do
soft-core gay pornography with Sledge

403
00:15:59,791 --> 00:16:02,416
in order to eradicate hookworms
out of my kitty's arse.

404
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:06,083
Okay, Green Bastard,
pretend you're packing up your gym bag,

405
00:16:06,166 --> 00:16:07,666
and Sledge will walk in.

406
00:16:07,916 --> 00:16:09,125
And what do I say?

407
00:16:09,208 --> 00:16:12,666
Just respond to whatever he says.
I want it to feel real.

408
00:16:12,916 --> 00:16:13,750
Action!

409
00:16:14,833 --> 00:16:18,166
Hey, I just broke up with my man
and could use a little consoling.

410
00:16:18,458 --> 00:16:19,875
Why leave so soon?

411
00:16:19,958 --> 00:16:22,291
Uh, have to, stove's on.

412
00:16:22,375 --> 00:16:25,208
Could burn the place down. Left it on.
Goodbye.

413
00:16:25,291 --> 00:16:27,250
-[locker slams]
-Well, I don't want you to go.

414
00:16:27,333 --> 00:16:28,666
[funky bass line playing]

415
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:30,791
Oh, yeah? Why is that, now?

416
00:16:31,083 --> 00:16:32,875
-Because I'm single now.
-[Bubbles] Uh-huh.

417
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:38,416
And I'd really like to get a look
at that hot, wet, back pussy of yours.

418
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:39,833
Yeah, okay, cut! Nope.

419
00:16:39,916 --> 00:16:41,708
Sorry, thought I could do this,

420
00:16:41,791 --> 00:16:44,208
but I don't think I'm cut out
for this type of film.

421
00:16:44,291 --> 00:16:45,708
Cut!

422
00:16:46,791 --> 00:16:49,708
What the bloody fuck is going on here?

423
00:16:49,791 --> 00:16:51,833
Brogan, deal with this.

424
00:16:51,916 --> 00:16:53,375
I got to squeeze out a deuce.

425
00:16:53,458 --> 00:16:54,916
We're taking an early lunch.

426
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,041
You have one hour
to get your shite together,

427
00:16:57,125 --> 00:16:59,416
or I recast all of you, you fucking cunts!

428
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,250
Well, we're in a real fucking pickle here,
boys.

429
00:17:02,333 --> 00:17:04,541
We better find someone
to pretend-fuck him,

430
00:17:04,625 --> 00:17:06,083
or my kitty is gonna die.

431
00:17:06,166 --> 00:17:07,958
-Here.
-[car rolling up]

432
00:17:08,083 --> 00:17:10,875
-Frig!
-What are you doing up there, Randy?

433
00:17:10,958 --> 00:17:13,375
Nobody in the park
has frigging cottage cheese,

434
00:17:13,458 --> 00:17:14,458
and he hates me.

435
00:17:14,541 --> 00:17:16,791
Just hang on. This is how it's done.

436
00:17:16,875 --> 00:17:20,375
Here, kitty. Come here, kitty.

437
00:17:20,791 --> 00:17:22,125
[Bubbles] Here, kitty!

438
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:23,750
-[kitten meows]
-It's okay, boy.

439
00:17:23,833 --> 00:17:26,750
Daddy's here with the tickle sticks.
Everything's gonna be alright.

440
00:17:26,833 --> 00:17:28,083
Who's got your belly?

441
00:17:28,166 --> 00:17:29,666
Wow, that's amazing.

442
00:17:30,541 --> 00:17:32,666
Y'all done filming, guys? How'd it go?

443
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:35,750
Uh, funny you mention that, Randy.

444
00:17:35,833 --> 00:17:37,708
You in an acting kind of mood, bud?

445
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:38,625
What do you mean?

446
00:17:39,041 --> 00:17:40,083
You know, we got thinking,

447
00:17:40,166 --> 00:17:42,625
and it's not right for us to deprive you
to be in this movie.

448
00:17:42,708 --> 00:17:44,083
Do you wanna be in a Clint movie?

449
00:17:44,166 --> 00:17:46,458
Well, I thought I was too ugly and stinky.

450
00:17:46,541 --> 00:17:48,791
And dumb.
Don't forget about the dumb part.

451
00:17:48,875 --> 00:17:50,250
Ricky, smarten the fuck up.

452
00:17:50,333 --> 00:17:52,458
-You wanna be in Clint's movie or what?
-What?

453
00:17:52,541 --> 00:17:53,875
Are you frigging serious?

454
00:17:53,958 --> 00:17:56,333
Yeah, serious, Randy.
There's one catch, though.

455
00:17:56,416 --> 00:17:59,000
You have to wear the Green Bastard suit.
He has to think it's me.

456
00:17:59,083 --> 00:18:01,416
But I'm allergic to fabric, you know that.

457
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:04,250
Who knows what will happen
if I had a full bodysuit on.

458
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:07,208
Come on, please, Randy.
I really need you to do this, bud.

459
00:18:07,291 --> 00:18:09,875
And there's a second catch.
You gotta give us the money

460
00:18:09,958 --> 00:18:11,708
-you're gonna make from it.
-What?

461
00:18:11,833 --> 00:18:14,708
Look, Randy,
Limp Bizkit's gonna die, okay?

462
00:18:14,791 --> 00:18:16,541
I'm desperate here, bud. Please!

463
00:18:16,625 --> 00:18:18,666
I don't know, guys. What's in it for me?

464
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:20,875
Well, I'll tell ya what's in it for you.

465
00:18:20,958 --> 00:18:22,583
Us being your buddies again.

466
00:18:22,958 --> 00:18:24,416
Forever. Right, boys?

467
00:18:24,916 --> 00:18:26,291
Boys! Right?

468
00:18:26,583 --> 00:18:29,666
Fuck's sakes, all right.
I'll do it, but I'm not happy about it.

469
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:31,083
Okay, I'll do it.

470
00:18:31,583 --> 00:18:34,541
-I'm in!
-Yeah, you're gonna be in, all right.

471
00:18:34,958 --> 00:18:36,250
Decent! Thanks, Randy!

472
00:18:36,333 --> 00:18:38,666
I'll go grab an old pair
of my glasses for you.

473
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:40,458
[laughing]

474
00:18:40,541 --> 00:18:42,583
-[woman] Quiet, please!
-[bell rings]

475
00:18:43,458 --> 00:18:46,000
My name is Bubbles, and I love kitties.

476
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:47,791
How did that sound, guys?

477
00:18:47,875 --> 00:18:49,750
I don't sound like Scooby-Doo, Randy.

478
00:18:49,833 --> 00:18:51,375
Just try not to talk, Randy.

479
00:18:51,458 --> 00:18:52,750
Guys, we're ready on set.

480
00:18:52,833 --> 00:18:53,958
[bell rings]

481
00:18:54,666 --> 00:18:55,666
Action!

482
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:58,625
-Hey, where do you think you're going?
-Oh, nowhere.

483
00:18:58,708 --> 00:19:00,375
Just tidying up my things.

484
00:19:00,458 --> 00:19:01,833
I like to be tidy.

485
00:19:01,916 --> 00:19:03,291
Well, that's good, then.

486
00:19:03,375 --> 00:19:08,875
I may need to drown my sorrows
by drowning you in my hot ball broth.

487
00:19:08,958 --> 00:19:12,125
You came to the right place
because I just finished working out

488
00:19:12,208 --> 00:19:14,541
and I'm pretty frigging moist.

489
00:19:14,625 --> 00:19:15,500
Oh, hey!

490
00:19:16,041 --> 00:19:18,708
You wanna get
a little something happening here,

491
00:19:18,791 --> 00:19:21,666
-do you, big fella?
-[rhythmic pounding]

492
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:25,083
How does my monster truck feel
in your little tiny garage?

493
00:19:25,166 --> 00:19:26,125
What are you doing?

494
00:19:26,708 --> 00:19:27,875
You're not even in.

495
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:32,916
-[lockers clatter]
-[Sledge screams]

496
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,791
[Randy growling] There we go.
That's better.

497
00:19:35,875 --> 00:19:39,750
-[screaming] I'm tapping out!
-Hold it.

498
00:19:39,833 --> 00:19:41,458
[Sledge groaning]

499
00:19:41,541 --> 00:19:43,833
-Cut! Check the gates.
-[bell rings]

500
00:19:43,916 --> 00:19:45,375
[clapping] That was the one.

501
00:19:45,458 --> 00:19:48,208
Holy shit, that was really good.
Really good acting.

502
00:19:48,291 --> 00:19:50,666
-[all clapping]
-I think only one of them was acting.

503
00:19:52,541 --> 00:19:55,333
Holy shit, boys.
We've got 1,900 bucks here.

504
00:19:55,416 --> 00:19:56,541
Yes, baby!

505
00:19:56,625 --> 00:20:00,125
Limp Bizkit's hole is gonna be all pink
and clean like a baby's heart!

506
00:20:00,208 --> 00:20:02,333
Okay, how are we gonna split up
the extra two hundy?

507
00:20:02,416 --> 00:20:04,583
I say we spend the whole thing
on a big chunk of hash.

508
00:20:04,666 --> 00:20:07,833
Nope, fuck that.
My cut is not going towards hash.

509
00:20:08,291 --> 00:20:10,666
Some extra cat food would come in handy,
though.

510
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:12,708
Wouldn't it, little buddy? [cooing]

511
00:20:13,291 --> 00:20:14,958
Holy shit, check you out.

512
00:20:15,041 --> 00:20:17,708
What? Do ya got the chicken bops,
or were you blowing the fucking sun?

513
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:19,166
-Ricky!
-What?

514
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:20,875
How's the rash feeling, Randy?

515
00:20:20,958 --> 00:20:23,458
I'm just airing it out.
It'll be fine, though.

516
00:20:23,541 --> 00:20:25,833
I just hope my date
doesn't get grossed out by it.

517
00:20:25,916 --> 00:20:26,791
Date?

518
00:20:27,208 --> 00:20:29,416
Oh, Randy's got a hot date, does he?

519
00:20:29,875 --> 00:20:32,458
I'm really frigging nervous.
I hope it goes well.

520
00:20:32,541 --> 00:20:35,083
-You know what will make it go well?
-What, Julian? Tell me!

521
00:20:35,166 --> 00:20:36,000
Here, bud.

522
00:20:36,541 --> 00:20:38,041
Seriously? For me?

523
00:20:38,458 --> 00:20:40,291
That was really nice of you, Julian.

524
00:20:40,375 --> 00:20:43,125
I mean, we did promise him friendship,
and money counts.

525
00:20:43,208 --> 00:20:46,083
What the fuck are you doing?
Why the fuck should he get the 200 bucks?

526
00:20:46,166 --> 00:20:49,500
Come on, Ricky, he did all the hard work
when you think about it.

527
00:20:49,583 --> 00:20:51,375
The hard work. [laughing]

528
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:53,708
Some people might say
he worked his ass off.

529
00:20:54,083 --> 00:20:55,500
-[car honks]
-Sorry, Randy.

530
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:57,541
What in the Christ?

531
00:20:57,708 --> 00:20:58,541
Sledge?

532
00:20:58,625 --> 00:21:01,791
We're going out for burgers
and to see where the night takes us.

533
00:21:01,875 --> 00:21:04,541
Well, good luck, Randy.
You did good today, buddy.

534
00:21:04,625 --> 00:21:05,541
Thanks, Julian.

535
00:21:06,375 --> 00:21:08,791
Today's been
a really weird fucking day, boys.

536
00:21:09,291 --> 00:21:11,541
Yeah, weird as fuck.

537
00:21:11,625 --> 00:21:13,041
Hey, let's get some burgers.

538
00:21:13,125 --> 00:21:14,458
-My treat.
-Yes.

539
00:21:14,541 --> 00:21:16,541

[waves splashing]

542
00:22:21,958 --> 00:22:23,958
[engine chugging]

543
00:22:33,208 --> 00:22:38,791
[voices] Oh, fuck.

544
00:22:38,875 --> 00:22:40,291
[man screaming] Jesus Christ!

545
00:22:40,375 --> 00:22:45,166
[whooshing]

546
00:22:46,541 --> 00:22:47,500
[man whispering] Fuck off.

1
00:00:10,583 --> 00:00:11,750
[guitar music playing quietly]

2
00:00:11,833 --> 00:00:15,666
Holy shit. This weed Reggie gave me
smells amazing. Smell that.

3
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:18,000
Check this cocksucker out, boys.

4
00:00:18,083 --> 00:00:21,458
Donair-Pogo-poutine night
is officially underway.

5
00:00:21,541 --> 00:00:23,000
-Fucking wicked, man!
-Yeah!

6
00:00:23,083 --> 00:00:24,791
Look at those cock-shaped sluts.

7
00:00:25,208 --> 00:00:26,458
Fucking right, baby.

8
00:00:26,541 --> 00:00:28,416
Extra sauce, too, boys.

9
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:30,208
Gimme one of those fucking things.

10
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:32,750
Oh, yeah.

11
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:35,791
[inhales deeply]

12
00:00:35,875 --> 00:00:41,291
[coughing]

13
00:00:41,833 --> 00:00:44,791
-Jesus, Ricky.
-Ricky, Jesus Murphy.

14
00:00:44,875 --> 00:00:46,791
Holy fuck, boys!

15
00:00:46,875 --> 00:00:50,708
I think this is old-school fucking weed,
like Panama Red or something good.

16
00:00:50,791 --> 00:00:53,250
[inhales, coughs]

17
00:00:53,333 --> 00:00:55,875
Jesus Christ, man. I think you're right.
[coughs]

18
00:00:55,958 --> 00:00:56,791
It is.

19
00:00:56,875 --> 00:00:59,708
[clears throat] Reminds me
of the weed I smoked with the old man

20
00:00:59,791 --> 00:01:02,250
when I was in grade 3
and he took us to the gun range. Remember?

21
00:01:02,333 --> 00:01:04,000
First weed I ever smoked.

22
00:01:04,083 --> 00:01:05,833
That's not the first time you smoked weed.

23
00:01:05,916 --> 00:01:08,166
The first time you smoked weed
was with me at the drive-in.

24
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:09,166
Fuck off.

25
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:11,916
Yes, it was. Remember that we took
the Polaski twins to see <i>Alien,</i>

26
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,583
that thing popped out of the guy's chest,

27
00:01:13,666 --> 00:01:15,375
and you shit yourself
and scared them away?

28
00:01:15,458 --> 00:01:17,291
Remember how high we were that night?

29
00:01:17,375 --> 00:01:20,125
Fuck yeah, I do. You're right, man.
That night was awesome.

30
00:01:20,208 --> 00:01:22,000
Wasn't it you that shit yourself?
It wasn't me.

31
00:01:22,083 --> 00:01:23,583
It wasn't me, it was you, you idiot.

32
00:01:23,666 --> 00:01:25,041
You guys are so fucked.

33
00:01:25,125 --> 00:01:27,333
And you're both wrong, by the way.

34
00:01:27,416 --> 00:01:30,458
First time we smoked Panama Red
was way before that.

35
00:01:30,541 --> 00:01:32,375
I remember it like it was yesterday.

36
00:01:32,458 --> 00:01:34,708
It was the last day of grade two.

37
00:01:34,791 --> 00:01:41,750
-1979 … [echoes]
-[piano melody plays]

38
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:44,500
Wow, man, you really did good, Bubs.

39
00:01:44,583 --> 00:01:47,208
Yeah, I guess I did alright, considering.

40
00:01:47,291 --> 00:01:49,958
Fuck, boys, I diddered betters

41
00:01:50,041 --> 00:01:51,750
Got 100s in that ones theres.

42
00:01:52,083 --> 00:01:55,666
Uh, that's actually
three different subjects, Ricky.

43
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:57,500
See you got a one in that one,

44
00:01:57,583 --> 00:02:01,000
and then you got a zero
in that one and that one.

45
00:02:01,083 --> 00:02:02,708
Fuckers into me!

46
00:02:02,791 --> 00:02:03,625
Sorry, Ricky.

47
00:02:03,708 --> 00:02:05,875
I'm sure we can do something fun
to cheer you up, though.

48
00:02:06,291 --> 00:02:08,250
What in the fucks is he talkings about?

49
00:02:08,333 --> 00:02:09,291
I don't gives a fuck.

50
00:02:09,375 --> 00:02:11,750
Just thinks of how easiers

51
00:02:11,833 --> 00:02:13,375
'cause I already knows alls this shits.

52
00:02:13,458 --> 00:02:15,583
Oh, that's one way to look at it,
I suppose.

53
00:02:16,041 --> 00:02:18,375
I can't believers
school's fucking done, boys.

54
00:02:18,458 --> 00:02:20,083

57
00:02:23,416 --> 00:02:26,791
Why the fuck would you wanna do that, huh?
You gotta pace yourself.

58
00:02:26,875 --> 00:02:29,541

-Oh, I can pickers into her.

00:03:19,583 --> 00:03:22,458
There ain't any fucking dope
into it to put into the piper.

81
00:03:22,541 --> 00:03:25,083
What in the fuck's
this crazy-looking papery thing

82
00:03:25,166 --> 00:03:28,125
with the number words onto her?
And why is it lockered up, I wonders?

83
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:29,583
Oh, that's a check, Ricky.

84
00:03:29,666 --> 00:03:31,583
You mean like a ten-fours on a CBer?

85
00:03:31,666 --> 00:03:34,083
No, not like that, Ricky.
This is like money, look.

86
00:03:34,166 --> 00:03:36,958
You write the amount in there,
and then you write who it's going to,

87
00:03:37,041 --> 00:03:39,166
-and you can buy things with it.
-What?

88
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:40,958
This in here papers got the money?

89
00:03:41,041 --> 00:03:43,208
Well, let's go fucking buyers
some shit then!

90
00:03:43,291 --> 00:03:44,916
Let's do it, boys. Come on!

91
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,458
This is gonna takers the party
to a whole news level.

92
00:03:47,541 --> 00:03:50,625
I promise you, this is gonna be
the best fucking partier ever.

93
00:03:50,708 --> 00:03:52,208
You know what we're gonna buy?

94
00:03:52,291 --> 00:03:53,875
We're gonna fucking buy the fireworkers!

95
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:55,666
[Ricky] You knows what?

96
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,791
Maybe we should getting buys a cars
with this insteader.

97
00:03:58,875 --> 00:04:00,125
Oh, hang on, Ricky.

98
00:04:00,208 --> 00:04:02,708
You can only buy as much
as what's in your dad's bank account

99
00:04:02,791 --> 00:04:03,625
to back it up.

100
00:04:03,708 --> 00:04:05,916
You gotta think of it kind of like an IOU.

101
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,125
What the fuckers is this having to do
with the spaceshipers and the alieners?

102
00:04:09,208 --> 00:04:11,625
-Let's just stick to the plan.
-Ricky, I know it was you

103
00:04:11,708 --> 00:04:13,958
who put peanut butter and Cheez Whiz
in my Dinkies!

104
00:04:14,041 --> 00:04:16,791
It's all baked in there,
and it won't come out. They're ruined!

105
00:04:16,875 --> 00:04:20,000
Why don't you shovers the Cheez Whizzers
up your arseholes, then eat it?

106
00:04:20,083 --> 00:04:22,708
Then get downers on your knees
and get the suckers offs to me going.

107
00:04:22,791 --> 00:04:25,166
You think I'm afraid of you, Ricky?
Well, I'm not!

108
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:27,000
Let's frigging go, right now!

109
00:04:27,083 --> 00:04:29,250
Why in the fucks are you taking off
your panters?

110
00:04:29,333 --> 00:04:32,250
-You gonna tries to do's me or something?
-In your dreams!

111
00:04:32,333 --> 00:04:34,708
They're my new grading pants,
but they're too snug,

112
00:04:34,791 --> 00:04:38,166
-and I don't wanna rip them!
-Right on. Let's fucking get 'er to go'd.

113
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:40,750
Boys, stop that right now!

114
00:04:41,333 --> 00:04:43,875
Oh, my goodness, another rash!

115
00:04:43,958 --> 00:04:45,250
Randall, take this off

116
00:04:45,333 --> 00:04:48,375
and leave it off until we can figure out
what you're allergic to.

117
00:04:48,458 --> 00:04:51,000
You mean,
just walk around with no shirt on?

118
00:04:51,083 --> 00:04:52,125
I'll get teased.

119
00:04:52,208 --> 00:04:53,541
Oh, don't be silly.

120
00:04:53,625 --> 00:04:56,458
Just until we figure out
what's causing your skin to break out.

121
00:04:56,541 --> 00:04:59,625
Okay, let's get 'er to the going,
you fucking sweaty little bitch!

122
00:04:59,708 --> 00:05:01,458
I'm gonna fucking getting gotten

123
00:05:01,541 --> 00:05:02,750
Boys, just stop!

124
00:05:02,833 --> 00:05:04,458
Nobody's killing anybody.

125
00:05:04,541 --> 00:05:08,250
Ricky, you did ruin his Dinkies.
I saw you put the peanut butter in them.

126
00:05:08,333 --> 00:05:10,250
I don't gives a fryings fucks!

127
00:05:10,333 --> 00:05:11,583
Well, it's not nice.

128
00:05:11,666 --> 00:05:15,041
Come on, Randy. We're going down
to the mall to buy some stuff for a party.

129
00:05:15,125 --> 00:05:16,833
You can come with us as our buddy.

130
00:05:16,916 --> 00:05:18,333
What? Are you fucking crazy?

131
00:05:18,416 --> 00:05:20,500
He's not fucking getting gotten
coming with us.

132
00:05:20,583 --> 00:05:22,250
It's fine, Ricky. Who gives a fuck?

133
00:05:22,333 --> 00:05:23,666
He can help us carry shit.

134
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:25,291
-Thanks, Julian.
-Uh-uh!

135
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:27,416
Don't fucking touch me, Randy. Ever.

136
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:31,750
He's not getting any of the checker money.
I'll tells you that for fucking suresly!

137
00:05:32,416 --> 00:05:34,333
So, I gotten noticer
you gots the hair growing

138
00:05:34,416 --> 00:05:36,375
on your armpiters and your tits,
eh, Randy?

139
00:05:36,458 --> 00:05:39,208
Does that meaners you got
the hair on your cockers, too?

140
00:05:39,291 --> 00:05:40,208
[laughs]

141
00:05:40,291 --> 00:05:42,916
[quietly] I don't think it grows
right on the wiener.

142
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,916
-I think it's more on the beans.
-Maybe I do, and maybe I don't.

143
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,750
-That's none of your frigging business.
-All right, listen up.

144
00:05:48,833 --> 00:05:50,916
So, how the fuck
does this thing work again?

145
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,083
Well, you can use it in any store, really.

146
00:05:53,166 --> 00:05:57,125
But the least risky way, in my opinion,
you write in the amount right there,

147
00:05:57,208 --> 00:06:00,416
and then you write "cash" right there
and just take her into the bank.

148
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:01,791
That's what we're gonna do, then.

149
00:06:01,875 --> 00:06:04,083
Good plans are about outsmarting people,
okay?

150
00:06:04,166 --> 00:06:05,041
Remember that.

151
00:06:05,125 --> 00:06:07,208
Randy, you look the oldest
with the hair on your chest,

152
00:06:07,291 --> 00:06:09,166
so you should be the one
that goes up and talks.

153
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:12,250
What? I'm not doing that.
That's frigging breaking the law.

154
00:06:12,333 --> 00:06:14,250
Ohs, fucker offs, you lame-o!

155
00:06:14,333 --> 00:06:17,291
What are youse, a fucking buck-buck,
hairy fucking chicken now?

156
00:06:17,375 --> 00:06:19,000
Look, if the person
asks you any questions,

157
00:06:19,083 --> 00:06:21,458
just pretend you're deaf,
and I'll do the talking, okay?

158
00:06:21,541 --> 00:06:23,125
Oh, and if you think they're onto us,

159
00:06:23,208 --> 00:06:25,250
just flash those
hairy fucking armpits at them.

160
00:06:25,333 --> 00:06:28,583
I don't know, Julian, I'm pretty nervous.
Like, this plan doesn't seem--

161
00:06:28,666 --> 00:06:31,208
Bubs, just trust me, would you?
I know what I'm doing.

162
00:06:31,291 --> 00:06:33,041
Plans are kind of my specialty now.

163
00:06:33,166 --> 00:06:34,000
Okay.

164
00:06:34,083 --> 00:06:36,000
[muzak playing]

165
00:06:36,416 --> 00:06:37,750
Oh, hi, gorgeous.

166
00:06:37,833 --> 00:06:40,666
My older brother here, he just wants
to cash a check for $100, please.

167
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:41,875
Okay.

168
00:06:41,958 --> 00:06:43,375
Do you have your bank book with you,

169
00:06:43,458 --> 00:06:45,250
Mr… LaFleur?

170
00:06:45,333 --> 00:06:47,583
Uh, well, he, there's…

171
00:06:47,666 --> 00:06:49,583
He can't actually talk. He's…

172
00:06:49,666 --> 00:06:50,708
he's a deaf midget.

173
00:06:50,791 --> 00:06:52,875
Okay, just give me one moment.

174
00:06:52,958 --> 00:06:55,083
-What else am I gonna say?
-What are you talking about?

175
00:06:55,166 --> 00:06:57,000
It's the first thing
that came out of my mouth.

176
00:06:57,083 --> 00:07:01,916
Uh, it appears there's only $2.37
in this account.

177
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,708
There is an overdraft plan,

178
00:07:03,791 --> 00:07:05,916
but I will need to see
some identification.

179
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,416
Uh, well, he, I think…

180
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:10,291
I'm pretty sure he lost that.

181
00:07:10,375 --> 00:07:14,375
What is your birth date, sir?
I just want to confirm something.

182
00:07:14,458 --> 00:07:17,291
Uh, his birthday. Well, I…

183
00:07:17,375 --> 00:07:19,125
I totally don't know that.

184
00:07:19,208 --> 00:07:21,666
-None of us know it!
-I should.

185
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:22,750
[phone unhooks]

186
00:07:22,833 --> 00:07:24,541
Security,

187
00:07:24,625 --> 00:07:25,708

00:07:25,791 --> 00:07:28,541
Oh, we's about to gettener fuckered, boys.

189
00:07:28,625 --> 00:07:30,500
Ways to gotten go there, Julians.

190
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:32,458
You really did
the outsmarting her, didn't youse?

191
00:07:32,541 --> 00:07:34,208
Oh, this is my fault, is it?

192
00:07:34,291 --> 00:07:37,166
C'mon, let's just get the fuck outta here.
Walk faster!

193
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:39,583
Boys, I think we're in the clear here.

-What ares it gonna bes, then?

00:09:27,375 --> 00:09:29,083
we tried, and it just didn't work,

244
00:09:29,166 --> 00:09:32,583
so let's just go back to the park,
and we can all calm our nerves.

245
00:09:32,666 --> 00:09:35,208
-Just take it down a notch.
-Calms our nervers?

246
00:09:35,291 --> 00:09:37,458
This is one of the bester days
of my lifer.

247
00:09:37,541 --> 00:09:40,041
And I thinks I likes throwing
those bottles a lots.

248
00:09:40,125 --> 00:09:42,333
I's gonna getting starting
doing a lots mores of that,

249
00:09:42,416 --> 00:09:43,583
maybe around in the parkers.

250
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:45,250
That was pretty awesome, Rick.

251
00:09:45,333 --> 00:09:46,583
We're like a team, boys.

252
00:09:46,666 --> 00:09:49,416
What a good way to get back
at someone that's pissing you off.

253
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:52,083
Or evens just a randomly attack,
or fucking haves some funners

254
00:09:52,166 --> 00:09:53,791
and scaring the fuckers out of somebodies.

255
00:09:54,458 --> 00:09:57,958
What are you guys talking about?
If we start doing stuff like that,

256
00:09:58,041 --> 00:10:00,666
we're gonna get
a really bad reputation really fast.

257
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:04,166
People might end up calling us
something awful, like "the Bottle Kids".

258
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:06,708
Oh, I'm getting to likers on that one.

259
00:10:06,791 --> 00:10:08,041
The Bottler Kids.

260
00:10:08,125 --> 00:10:10,291
That would be
a cool fucking nickname, boys.

261
00:10:10,375 --> 00:10:13,875
You guys sound crazy.
Can we please just go back to the park?

262
00:10:13,958 --> 00:10:15,291
Oh, fuckers that.

263
00:10:15,375 --> 00:10:18,125
I promised the fireworkers,
and we's gonna have the fireworkers.

264
00:10:18,208 --> 00:10:20,833
We's gonna have the hugest party ever
back at the parks!

265
00:10:20,916 --> 00:10:23,416
-Let's do this, boys!
-Come on, Bubs, put 'em in.

266
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:25,000
Getter putting in there, Bubs.

267
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:26,916
[Bubbles grumbles]

268
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,125
-[all] Yeah!
-[Julian] Right, here's the deal.

269
00:10:29,208 --> 00:10:31,708
Security's gonna be cleaning up
bottles for another 10 minutes,

270
00:10:31,791 --> 00:10:33,250
so we should have at least that long.

271
00:10:33,333 --> 00:10:35,166
That is mores than enough times.

272
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:38,625
Holy fuck, boys, check that out!
It's a '75 Monte Carlo!

273
00:10:38,708 --> 00:10:41,958
And no way,
it's the one with the 454 four-barrel!

274
00:10:42,041 --> 00:10:42,875
No way!

275
00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:45,500
-That is badder-fucking-assers!
-That is fucking wicked!

276
00:10:45,583 --> 00:10:48,125
It's a car, who gives a fuck?
Can we focus here?

277
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:52,041
Look, I'm nervous about this.
I've never shoplifted anything in my life.

278
00:10:52,125 --> 00:10:53,250
All right, Bubs, that's fine.

279
00:10:53,333 --> 00:10:55,375
You can stand by the front doors
and be lookout.

280
00:10:55,458 --> 00:10:58,500
If you see security coming,
do a really loud bird call to signal us.

281
00:10:58,583 --> 00:11:01,500
Bird call? What are you
fucking talking about? Do a bird call?

282
00:11:01,583 --> 00:11:04,125
-I don't know a bird call.
-You know what a fucking bird call is.

283
00:11:04,208 --> 00:11:05,666
Just any kind of a bird call.

284
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:07,541
I likers me the crowers
and them bluer jays

285
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:08,958
and maybe the eagles.

286
00:11:09,041 --> 00:11:10,666
-It doesn't matter--
-Don't do a pigeons

287
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:13,791
'cause I don't likers them.
They can suckers me the fucks off.

288
00:11:13,875 --> 00:11:15,666
It doesn't matter
what the fucking bird is.

289
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:17,458
Just do it loud, okay?

290
00:11:17,541 --> 00:11:20,250
-And we'll know it's you.
-I'll do a fucking bird call, then!

291
00:11:20,333 --> 00:11:21,458
Hey, settle the fuck down.

292
00:11:21,541 --> 00:11:23,250
We gotta go. We're running out of time.

293
00:11:23,333 --> 00:11:24,333
I vote for the crowers.

294
00:11:24,416 --> 00:11:26,250
[register beeping]

295
00:11:26,958 --> 00:11:29,875
[grunts] Okay, here, man. Fill these up.
We'll make it look

296
00:11:29,958 --> 00:11:32,458
-like we're taking out the trash.
-No, man, that's dumbly.

297
00:11:32,541 --> 00:11:35,500
I'm getting thinking the best way
to get her done is to loader up a carter,

298
00:11:35,583 --> 00:11:37,666
walk her right out the front doors
like we's paid.

299
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:40,750
-What the fuck are you talking about?
-Getting thinks about it.

300
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:43,291
You sawers someone going out
the front door with a cart of shit,

301
00:11:43,375 --> 00:11:45,666
you're never gonna get to thinking
they're stealing her.

302
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:46,791
You'd says to yourself,

303
00:11:46,875 --> 00:11:49,000
"Who the fuck's'd be stupider
or dumbs enoughs

304
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:52,083
to get into that fucking going on?"
Well, I am. That's who.

305
00:11:52,166 --> 00:11:53,583
We shouldn't even use a carter.

306
00:11:53,666 --> 00:11:56,166
Let's load everything up
in the canoe boat. Even smartlier!

307
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:58,583
No, that's stupid.
Let's just use the fucking cart.

308
00:11:58,666 --> 00:11:59,625
[cart rattling]

309

There you go. Good as new.

320
00:12:41,666 --> 00:12:43,833
Well, thank you, young man.

321
00:12:43,916 --> 00:12:45,250
Aren't you clever?

322
00:12:45,333 --> 00:12:46,541
Oh, not really.

323
00:12:46,625 --> 00:12:49,125
Just a double-wrapped bag
gumming up the bearings.

Ah, fuck! That's Bubs!

329
00:13:02,708 --> 00:13:05,166
{\an8}I don't do thinking so.
That sounded like a real crower.

330
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:07,000
{\an8}No, it wasn't. It's the fucking PA.

331
00:13:07,083 --> 00:13:09,166
-It was Bubbles. Let's go.

Well, these guys are

-Fuckers!
-Let's just turn ourselves in.

369

Nobody can outrun the police.

Bubs, are you crazy?

371
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:31,291
Do you realize

No, I don't!

00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:07,000
-Yes!
-They rolled it right down off the bank.

389
00:15:07,083 --> 00:15:08,583
They could be hurt really bad!

390
00:15:08,666 --> 00:15:10,916
[laughs] That is the awesomer!

391
00:15:13,708 --> 00:15:16,166
Hey, guys, where'd you get
all this cool stuff?

392
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:18,583
We stoles it.
Ain't that'n gotten pretty cool?

393
00:15:18,666 --> 00:15:21,458
Not really, Ricky.
It kind of makes you a loser.

394
00:15:21,541 --> 00:15:24,041
Oh, I hope they didn't get you involved.
Did they, Bubbles?

[Bubbles groans]

396
00:15:25,875 --> 00:15:29,000
-Maybe a little bit.
-Hey, Tyrone. How you getting goings?

Hey, Rick, what's going on?
How are you today?

00:15:31,291 --> 00:15:33,708
Just wondering if you got
any more of your dad's hash.

399
00:15:33,791 --> 00:15:37,875
You're selling drugs now, too, Ricky?
That's not cool. Drugs are illegal.

400
00:15:38,333 --> 00:15:40,500
I just didder sold
a bit of my dad's, Sarah.

401
00:15:40,583 --> 00:15:43,541
It's not like I'm gonna get doing this
for the fucking job or anything.

402

00:22:30,083 --> 00:22:31,000
[Ricky yells]

575
00:22:31,083 --> 00:22:35,083
[piano theme music playing]

576
00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:36,250
[seagulls cawing]

577
00:23:36,333 --> 00:23:38,333
[waves splashing]

578
00:23:38,416 --> 00:23:40,416
[engine chugging]

579
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:54,958
[voices] Oh, fuck.

580
00:23:55,041 --> 00:23:56,541
Jesus Christ!

581
00:23:56,625 --> 00:24:01,791
[whooshing]

582
00:24:02,791 --> 00:24:04,666
[man whispers]<i> Fuck off.</i>

1
00:00:12,833 --> 00:00:13,708
[snoring softly]

2
00:00:13,791 --> 00:00:15,833
-[softly] Slow-fried bologna.
-[meowing]

3
00:00:16,416 --> 00:00:18,750
Munster cheese.

4
00:00:19,125 --> 00:00:20,583
-Lightly toasted.
-[meowing]

5
00:00:20,666 --> 00:00:21,500
[metal banging]

6
00:00:21,583 --> 00:00:23,875
-[man] Fuck! C'mere, you lil' bastard!
-[cat hissing]

7
00:00:23,958 --> 00:00:25,250
The flying fuck?

8
00:00:25,333 --> 00:00:27,625
[cat yowling]

9
00:00:27,708 --> 00:00:30,041
What are you doing? Those are my kitties.

10
00:00:30,125 --> 00:00:33,583
Are they?
I don't see any collars or ID tags.

11
00:00:33,666 --> 00:00:35,208
-You got paperwork?
-[meowing]

12
00:00:35,291 --> 00:00:37,916
I don't have paperwork.
They're free-range kitties.

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,125
I look after them. I'm not a neglecter,
if that's what you're thinking.

14
00:00:41,208 --> 00:00:44,791
Sorry. No papers, I gotta round 'em up
and get 'em to the shelter.

15
00:00:44,875 --> 00:00:48,416
No, you give them back right the fuck now,
or I'll fucking crank you!

16
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:52,958
Sir, you might want to think twice
before you assault a city employee.

17
00:00:53,041 --> 00:00:55,708
Not Catsy Kline, bud. No fucking way!

18
00:00:56,166 --> 00:00:58,375
-[zaps]
-Ah! My testicles!

19
00:00:59,333 --> 00:01:00,416
Have a good day now.

20
00:01:01,666 --> 00:01:03,125
Cocksucker!

21
00:01:03,791 --> 00:01:08,791
[piano theme music playing]

22
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:15,416
Hey, Ricky,
whenever you need digging done,

23
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:17,541
I'm your digger, dude.
[grunts]

24
00:01:17,625 --> 00:01:21,416
Cory, shut the fuck up and keep digging.
There's a lot of work to do here.

25
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:24,500
Fuck, T. What the fuck's up with Finch?
Get him off of there

26
00:01:24,583 --> 00:01:27,458
-and get him digging again!
-Can't. He's high as fuck.

27
00:01:27,541 --> 00:01:30,375
This motherfucker mixed Kashmir hash
with Temple Ball.

28
00:01:30,458 --> 00:01:33,208
Now he's all fucked up.
He don't know where the fuck he's at.

29
00:01:33,291 --> 00:01:37,250
Yo, I just made a dirt angel
up in this motherfucker.

30
00:01:37,333 --> 00:01:38,208
For real!

31
00:01:38,291 --> 00:01:40,708
-Ricky, what the frig are you doing?
-Hey, Randy.

32
00:01:40,791 --> 00:01:43,625
I know you're pregnant,
but grab a shovel and help us fucking dig.

33
00:01:43,708 --> 00:01:46,166
What? No, I'm not digging.
You can't dig here!

34
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:48,458
-Sorry, I need the dirt for my trailer.
-Why?

35
00:01:48,541 --> 00:01:51,041
I'm making a dirt mountain
and putting my trailer on top.

36
00:01:51,125 --> 00:01:52,541
I'll have the best view in Sunnyvale.

37
00:01:52,625 --> 00:01:55,416
You can see so much from up there.
You can see the Penhorn Mall.

38
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:58,083
You can see the ocean.
You can see the horizon.

39
00:01:58,166 --> 00:02:01,166
You're crazy! You can't just dig
and build frigging hills

40
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:04,166
wherever the frig you want to!
This isn't your property!

41
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:06,666
Oh, really? Well, sorry.
I can't talk right now.

42
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:08,541
Gotta dig up this pile of dog shit.

43
00:02:08,625 --> 00:02:10,750
-Ricky, stop!
-How do you like that? [laughs]

44
00:02:10,833 --> 00:02:11,791
Frig.

45
00:02:11,875 --> 00:02:13,208
-Frig off!
-Oh, my fuck.

46
00:02:13,291 --> 00:02:16,750
Oh, you wanna fuck around, do you?
You pick that shovel up, right now!

47
00:02:16,833 --> 00:02:18,250
You frig off, Ricky!

48
00:02:18,333 --> 00:02:21,666
Ricky, every frigging day,
I gotta deal with you and your bullshit!

49
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:23,750
-That's right. I don't give a fuck.
-I'm tired of it!

50
00:02:23,833 --> 00:02:26,083
-Fuck off.
-You think you got the power over me,

51
00:02:26,166 --> 00:02:28,666
but guess what,
I'm the trailer park supervisor!

52
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:29,875
And you're jealous of me

53
00:02:29,958 --> 00:02:32,125
because you're nothing
but a frigging bum. A bum!

54
00:02:32,208 --> 00:02:34,166
I'm fucking jealous of you? Oh, my fuck.

55
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:37,041
Get ready to have a miscarriage
'cause we're going, right the fuck now.

56
00:02:37,125 --> 00:02:38,958
-Come on, Randy!
-Frig off, Ricky!

57
00:02:39,041 --> 00:02:41,083
-Would you boys break it up?
-How d'you like that?

58
00:02:41,166 --> 00:02:42,875
-Smarten the fuck up!
-Here we go.

59
00:02:42,958 --> 00:02:45,291
-You wanna have a ball-off?
-I do wanna have a ball-off.

60
00:02:45,375 --> 00:02:47,958
-You think I wanna bang you? Come on!
-[groaning]

61
00:02:48,416 --> 00:02:49,500
How does that feel?

62
00:02:49,583 --> 00:02:51,875
-[Randy groans]
-Here we go. Fuck you.

63
00:02:51,958 --> 00:02:53,541
I got a good grip now, don't I?

64
00:02:53,625 --> 00:02:56,458
-[Randy] Fuck you!
-You guys seriously having a ball-off?

65
00:02:56,541 --> 00:02:58,166
That's junior-high shit, boys.

66
00:02:58,250 --> 00:02:59,250
Fuck off, Julian!

67
00:02:59,333 --> 00:03:01,416
-[Randy] Frig.
-Boys!

68
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,750
-We got an emergency situation, code red!
-[Ricky groans]

69
00:03:03,833 --> 00:03:06,375
-So do we, Bubbles.
-I don't know what the fuck

70
00:03:06,458 --> 00:03:09,083
you're trying to settle there,
but let go of each other's nutsacks

71
00:03:09,166 --> 00:03:10,416
-right now!
-Calm down.

72
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,958
-What the fuck's going on, man?
-What's happening?

73
00:03:13,041 --> 00:03:15,208
[crying] They took my cats!
Every one of them!

74
00:03:15,291 --> 00:03:17,541
Gary Laser Eyes, Muhammad Meowe,

75
00:03:17,625 --> 00:03:19,291
Drew Hairy-more, Henry Hissinger!

76
00:03:19,375 --> 00:03:20,916
They even got Donald Cunt!

77
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,583
-Who took them?
-What?

78
00:03:22,666 --> 00:03:25,208
Some fucking cock-eater
from animal control!

79
00:03:25,291 --> 00:03:28,583
They're all in cages down at the shelter.
I'm fucking losing it here!

80
00:03:28,666 --> 00:03:31,375
-For fuck's sakes.
-Okay. Let's go get them back, then.

81
00:03:31,458 --> 00:03:33,333
-[Julian] Let's go, Rick!
-This isn't over,

82
00:03:33,416 --> 00:03:35,708
-you fucking weebley-blobbly fuck!
-Frig off, Ricky!

83
00:03:35,791 --> 00:03:37,041
Come on, give me those nuts.

84
00:03:37,125 --> 00:03:38,125
-Give me the--
-Ricky!

85
00:03:38,208 --> 00:03:40,375
-Let's finish this!
-Leave Randy's nuts alone. Let's go!

86
00:03:40,458 --> 00:03:42,458
Fucking-- Give me one more second!
I can take him.

87
00:03:42,541 --> 00:03:44,333
-Fuck off!
-Let's go! Come on!

88
00:03:44,416 --> 00:03:45,375
Fuck sakes!

89
00:03:47,125 --> 00:03:49,750
Hi there, my name's Bubbles,
from Sunnyvale Trailer Park.

90
00:03:49,833 --> 00:03:52,041
-I'm here to retrieve my kitties.
-Okay.

91
00:03:52,166 --> 00:03:55,541
We just need to make sure their shots
and licenses are up to date.

92
00:03:55,625 --> 00:03:58,250
We don't need to worry
about any of that sort of stuff.

93
00:03:58,333 --> 00:04:00,291
They're all just fine and dandy,
believe me.

94
00:04:00,375 --> 00:04:04,250
Sir, can you not eat those, please?
Those are dog treats.

95
00:04:04,333 --> 00:04:07,166
Fuck off. Really? Wow.
They're better than human pepperoni.

96
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:08,916
I'll definitely take
a couple bags of these.

97
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,125
Ricky, put those down.

98
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:12,666
Please, ma'am.
I just really need to get my kitties.

99
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:14,208
They've never been in cages before.

100
00:04:14,291 --> 00:04:16,375
I'm scared they could have
permanent mental trauma.

101
00:04:16,458 --> 00:04:20,041
I am sorry, sir,
but due to a new city ordinance,

102
00:04:20,125 --> 00:04:22,041
we cannot release any kitties

103
00:04:22,125 --> 00:04:25,750
until we know their licenses
and their shots are up to date.

104
00:04:25,833 --> 00:04:27,916
Oh, my God, how much is that gonna be?

105
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Well…

106
00:04:29,083 --> 00:04:32,791
it looks like 67 cats were picked up

107
00:04:32,875 --> 00:04:34,916
from the Sunnyvale Trailer Park.

108
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,916
How many of those would be yours?

109
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,916
-All of them.
-Wow! [laughs]

110
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Okay…

111
00:04:40,458 --> 00:04:43,000
Sixty-seven cats…

112
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:46,000
times 150…

113
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:49,291
You're looking at 10,050 dollars.

114
00:04:49,375 --> 00:04:52,166
-How would you like to pay?
-What? Holy, sweet fuck!

115
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:54,375
-I can't pay that kind of money!
-[cats meowing]

116
00:04:54,458 --> 00:04:57,250
Jesus Murphy! Listen, boys.
Listen, that's them!

117
00:04:57,333 --> 00:04:58,875
They're calling for me!

118
00:04:58,958 --> 00:05:02,333
Oh, my God, you can hear the PTSD
in their little meows!

119
00:05:02,416 --> 00:05:03,875
I'm coming! I'm here!

120
00:05:03,958 --> 00:05:06,416
It's okay, fellas. Just stay calm!

121
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:10,041
Oh, my fuck, you open this door,
right the fuck now, or I swear!

122
00:05:10,125 --> 00:05:13,291
I can't do that, sir.
Please, don't make me call security.

123
00:05:13,375 --> 00:05:16,875
Come on, let's go. We're not gonna be able
to help them if you're in jail.

124
00:05:16,958 --> 00:05:18,083
We gotta regroup here.

125
00:05:18,625 --> 00:05:21,833
Kidnappers. You're all just
a bunch of heartless kidnappers!

126
00:05:21,916 --> 00:05:24,375
Take it up with the mayor.
It's his ordinance.

127
00:05:24,458 --> 00:05:27,458
You bet your fucking ass
I'll take it up with the goddamn mayor…

128
00:05:28,166 --> 00:05:29,000
Janey.

129
00:05:29,083 --> 00:05:31,916
Hey, Goldie Girl, here's something
you can take up with the mayor.

130
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,416
You tell him to take both of these,

131
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,625
duct-tape them together,
sandwiched around my cock,

132
00:05:35,708 --> 00:05:39,000
and shove the whole fucking unit
right up his goddamn mayorly fucking ass!

133
00:05:39,083 --> 00:05:40,333
[gasps]

134
00:05:43,791 --> 00:05:44,750
There he is, boys.

135
00:05:44,833 --> 00:05:46,291
Hey, Mayor Dodge, wait!

136
00:05:46,375 --> 00:05:47,750
Ah, cripes!

137
00:05:47,833 --> 00:05:48,916
Mayor Dodge, listen!

138
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,625
Why are you making everybody pay
to get their cats back?

139
00:05:51,708 --> 00:05:54,083
Because I'm the mayor
and I know what's right for my people.

140
00:05:54,166 --> 00:05:57,250
Like taking kickbacks?
I watch the fucking news, asshole.

141
00:05:57,333 --> 00:05:59,125
What deal you got going
with animal control?

142
00:05:59,208 --> 00:06:01,625
All that money goes back into the city.

143
00:06:01,708 --> 00:06:03,750
Then in your pocket to pay
for your goddamn whores.

144
00:06:03,833 --> 00:06:04,708
I watch the news too.

145
00:06:04,791 --> 00:06:06,333
-No, you don't, Ricky.
-Sometimes.

146
00:06:06,416 --> 00:06:09,708
If I was spending whore money,
it'd come from my personal account.

147
00:06:09,791 --> 00:06:11,500
Please, Mr. Mayor. Look, I--

148
00:06:11,583 --> 00:06:14,083
Just repeal the ordinance.
Don't be a dickweed.

149
00:06:14,166 --> 00:06:16,250
Bug off!
I don't have time for your bullshit.

150
00:06:16,333 --> 00:06:17,375
You're such a fuckhead.

151
00:06:17,458 --> 00:06:20,208
I don't know shit about politics,
but why would anyone vote you back in?

152
00:06:20,291 --> 00:06:22,500
[laughs] I'm running unopposed.

153
00:06:22,583 --> 00:06:24,458
-Unopposed?
-What the fuck does that mean?

154
00:06:24,916 --> 00:06:29,250
It means I can get caught fucking
a baby goat on your grandma's grave,

155
00:06:29,333 --> 00:06:31,125
and I'd still get elected.

156
00:06:31,208 --> 00:06:34,083
That's what you can do
when you're the only candidate.

157
00:06:34,166 --> 00:06:35,666
[evil laughter]

158
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:40,291
Oh, you're the only candidate, are you?
Yeah? Well, guess what, then?

159
00:06:41,166 --> 00:06:43,958
I, Bubbles,
from the Sunnyvale Trailer Park,

160
00:06:44,041 --> 00:06:47,333
officially declare my candidacy
right here right now

161
00:06:47,708 --> 00:06:48,750
to run for mayor

162
00:06:48,833 --> 00:06:51,541
against this crooked cocksucker
right here!

163
00:06:51,625 --> 00:06:53,625
Well, yep, I'm running for mayor.

164
00:06:53,708 --> 00:06:55,625
Whatever it takes to save my kitties.

165
00:06:55,708 --> 00:06:57,583
I mean, normally,
it would take weeks of planning

166
00:06:57,666 --> 00:06:59,708
to put together a campaign
for something like this,

167
00:06:59,791 --> 00:07:02,541
but as soon as I told Julian
the kind of power I'd have

168
00:07:02,625 --> 00:07:03,916
if I win this cocksucker,

169
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,958
you could literally hear the grease wheels
turning in his head.

170
00:07:07,041 --> 00:07:09,291
And then, fucking kablamo! Just like that,

171
00:07:09,375 --> 00:07:12,208
he's got the campaign up and running.
Full torque, baby.

172
00:07:12,291 --> 00:07:15,625
I've got everybody in Sunnyvale helping
Bubs try to win this fucking thing.

173
00:07:15,708 --> 00:07:18,500
Politics is like, well,
it's like a group effort.

174
00:07:18,583 --> 00:07:19,958
He wins, I fucking win.

175
00:07:20,041 --> 00:07:22,750
So, I got Ricky out campaigning
around town.

176
00:07:22,833 --> 00:07:23,791
{\an8}Hey, everybody!

177
00:07:23,875 --> 00:07:27,291
{\an8}Fuck that cocksucking
fat fuck, crack-smoking cockbag, Dodge.

178
00:07:27,375 --> 00:07:28,625
{\an8}Vote for Bubbles for mayor!

179
00:07:29,041 --> 00:07:32,208
<i>I told Cory and Jacob to go door-to-door</i>
<i>to get his name out there.</i>

180
00:07:32,291 --> 00:07:35,041
And I got Bubbles out on the street,
talking to people, you know,

181
00:07:35,125 --> 00:07:37,000
about issues and shit they care about.

182
00:07:37,083 --> 00:07:40,083
Throw a little bit of heart in there.
People eat that stuff up big-time.

183
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:43,041
And now, when I get up in the morning,

184
00:07:43,125 --> 00:07:45,625
{\an8}there's no more
little sandpaper kitty tongues

185
00:07:45,708 --> 00:07:46,625
{\an8}licking my face.

186
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:50,583
{\an8}There's no more furry little motorboats
purring on my head.

187
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,333
[whimpering]

188
00:07:52,416 --> 00:07:53,666
I live alone now.

189
00:07:54,166 --> 00:07:56,041
Just a saucer of milk on the floor...

190
00:07:56,541 --> 00:07:58,208
{\an8}filled with nothing but memories.

191
00:07:58,916 --> 00:08:00,875
{\an8}[crying] It's just not right!

192
00:08:01,333 --> 00:08:03,083
{\an8}We need to save our kitties!

193
00:08:03,541 --> 00:08:05,375
{\an8}So vote for Bubbles for mayor!

194
00:08:05,916 --> 00:08:08,875
{\an8}'Cause I'll fight for you
and I'll fight for your kitties.

195
00:08:08,958 --> 00:08:12,541
{\an8}They might take our tax dollars,
but they'll never take

196
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:14,916
{\an8}-our kitties' freedom!
-[applause]

197
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,041
{\an8}Bubbles with a very moving speech

198
00:08:18,125 --> 00:08:20,750
{\an8}as he campaigns to be
the new mayor of Sunnyvale.

199
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:22,125
{\an8}And to be honest,

200
00:08:22,208 --> 00:08:24,166
{\an8}this old newsman, Steve Rogers,

201
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:28,041
{\an8}hasn't shed a tear like this
since my sweet mother surprised me

202
00:08:28,125 --> 00:08:30,583
{\an8}with the Evel Knievel Super Cycle

203
00:08:30,666 --> 00:08:32,500
{\an8}for my 15th birthday.

204
00:08:32,583 --> 00:08:33,666
{\an8}You go, Bubbles.

205
00:08:35,208 --> 00:08:36,958
Fuck, things aren't looking good here.

206
00:08:37,041 --> 00:08:39,125
We gotta figure out a way
to get more votes going.

207
00:08:39,208 --> 00:08:41,916
You just get everyone to vote
like five or ten times each.

208
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,583
You can't do that, Ricky.

209
00:08:43,666 --> 00:08:45,333
Excuse me. Hi.

210
00:08:45,416 --> 00:08:47,708
You seem like someone
who is involved in this campaign.

211
00:08:47,791 --> 00:08:48,916
Yes, I'm Julian.

212
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,333
I'm Bubbles's campaign manager.
This is my associate here, Ricky.

213
00:08:52,416 --> 00:08:53,250
How you doing?

214
00:08:53,333 --> 00:08:55,625
Can you go smoke that somewhere else,
please?

215
00:08:55,708 --> 00:08:56,541
Oh, fuck off.

216
00:08:56,625 --> 00:08:59,875
Heaven forgive I get a little weed smoke
on your precious suits.

217
00:08:59,958 --> 00:09:02,291
Sorry about that.
Here, take a Bubbles pin.

218
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:05,166
Thank you, but I won't be needing that.
I'd like to cut to the chase.

219
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:06,541
I work for the mayor's office,

220
00:09:06,625 --> 00:09:09,250
but I don't work
for that fat fucking manatee, Dodge.

221
00:09:09,333 --> 00:09:11,541
-Okay, good.
-What if I were to tell you

222
00:09:11,625 --> 00:09:13,541
I could guarantee
I'd get your boy in office?

223
00:09:13,625 --> 00:09:15,208
[scoffs] Sounds greasy.

224
00:09:15,291 --> 00:09:18,583
Isn't there always a little grease
behind every successful business plan?

225
00:09:18,666 --> 00:09:21,041
Oh, definitely.
I'm all for grease, believe me.

226
00:09:21,125 --> 00:09:24,125
-What are you talking about here?
-We make sure Bubbles wins the election,

227
00:09:24,208 --> 00:09:26,375
and then you make sure
he signs a few documents

228
00:09:26,458 --> 00:09:28,166
that will rezone parts of the city.

229
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:29,583
-That's it?
-No.

230
00:09:29,666 --> 00:09:31,458
Then you have to figure out
how you'll spend

231
00:09:31,541 --> 00:09:33,208
all the money you'll be making.

232
00:09:33,291 --> 00:09:35,416
Seems like a no-brainer to me. Sign me up.

233
00:09:36,208 --> 00:09:39,041
[man on TV] <i>Our late votes are finally</i>
<i>coming in from District Four,</i>

234
00:09:39,125 --> 00:09:42,375

236

-Shut the fuck up.

237
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:50,875
Can't believe I'm getting my ass kicked
by a tubby little fucking crackhead.

238
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:52,958
Hold on,
this could totally turn around.

239
00:09:53,041 --> 00:09:56,000
Yeah, turn around.
Are you fucking crazy, Julian?

240
00:09:56,083 --> 00:09:58,458
I need a goddamn miracle to win this.

241
00:09:58,541 --> 00:10:00,958
Miracles are real.
They're wishes made from dreams.

242
00:10:01,041 --> 00:10:02,166
That's not true, dude.

243
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:04,583
-They come from unicorns.
-My fuck, you two. Shut up!

244

I'm the goddamn mayor!

254
00:10:32,083 --> 00:10:34,625
Mr. Mayor, sir,
how about a hit off this dirty,

255
00:10:34,708 --> 00:10:37,250
six-paper fucking whore
to celebrate your first day in office?

256
00:10:37,333 --> 00:10:39,458
Ricky, no fucking way I'm getting high.

257
00:10:39,541 --> 00:10:41,458
I have to get going
on my kitty reform bill.

258
00:10:41,541 --> 00:10:43,416
My cats' lives are at stake here.

259
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:44,416
Mayor Bubbles.

260
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:48,625
As requested, the Cat Ordinance Bill,
Statute 22B.

261
00:10:48,708 --> 00:10:52,416
Holy fuck! That is a whore of a stack!

262
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:54,791
Oh, sorry. Thank you, Bridget.

263
00:10:54,875 --> 00:10:56,166
Boys, this is Bridget.

264
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:57,333
Yeah, we've met, man.

265
00:10:57,416 --> 00:10:59,833
[whispering] I got a fucking assistant.
How cool is that?

266
00:10:59,916 --> 00:11:02,750
-It's fucking fancy, man.
-Decent.

267
00:11:02,833 --> 00:11:04,583
Okay, Mr. Mayor, sir.

268
00:11:04,666 --> 00:11:06,000
Today's itinerary:

269
00:11:06,083 --> 00:11:09,250
10:15 a.m.
Gas station ribbon cutting on Wyse Road.

270
00:11:09,333 --> 00:11:12,000
After that, a quick photo op
at a seniors' bake sale.

271
00:11:12,083 --> 00:11:15,041
Which takes us up to the twelve o'clock
crosswalk approvals.

272
00:11:15,125 --> 00:11:16,958
Then there's
the Pleasant Street intersection.

273
00:11:17,041 --> 00:11:20,541
Just hang the fuck on here for a second.
I don't have time to do all that stuff.

274
00:11:20,625 --> 00:11:23,250
I got a 500-fucking-page document
to get through,

275
00:11:23,333 --> 00:11:26,208
then I gotta set up hearings
to reform this kitty bill.

276
00:11:26,291 --> 00:11:29,208
I gotta go through committees.
There's a lot of red tape here.

277
00:11:29,291 --> 00:11:33,000
Saving the kitties, it's gonna be
a big, dirty fucking undertaking, okay?

278
00:11:33,083 --> 00:11:34,875
But that's gotta be the priority.

279
00:11:34,958 --> 00:11:36,500
Well, as mayor,

280
00:11:36,583 --> 00:11:39,166
you do have the power
to deputize your friends.

281
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:40,416
What? What do you mean?

282
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:43,333
This would give them the power
to do the boring stuff, like…

283
00:11:43,416 --> 00:11:47,750
overseeing project sites,
road repairs, cutting opening-day ribbons,

284
00:11:47,833 --> 00:11:49,416
supervising fundraisers.

285
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,208
I don't know. Sounds like work to me.

286
00:11:51,291 --> 00:11:53,166
If it's gonna help Bubs out,
sign me up.

287
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:55,125
-And you're helping too.
-Fuck's sakes.

288
00:11:55,208 --> 00:11:58,000
Great. I'll see that you get
your credentials, identifications,

289
00:11:58,083 --> 00:11:59,791
and badges by end of day today.

290
00:11:59,875 --> 00:12:01,125
-Cool.
-Thank fuck.

291
00:12:01,208 --> 00:12:03,875
This is gonna be awesome, boys.
Thanks for doing that.

292
00:12:03,958 --> 00:12:07,125
This is gonna take a big, dirty load
off my chest.

293
00:12:07,208 --> 00:12:10,416
You should probably chill out
on the sex talk now that you're mayor, no?

294
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:13,083
What? Sex talk?
No, not that kind of load, Ricky.

295
00:12:13,166 --> 00:12:15,750
You take care of your cats.
I'll take care of everything else.

296
00:12:15,833 --> 00:12:17,791
Come on, Ricky. Let's get to work, bud.

297
00:12:17,875 --> 00:12:19,291
Fuck, it's gonna be awesome

298
00:12:19,375 --> 00:12:21,166
-being the boss of this town.
-Is it?

299
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:26,666
What the fuck is taking so long?
I'm gonna need somebody to run out

300
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:30,250
-and grab me more beer.
-[sirens]

301
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:31,458
Jesus, Ricky.

302
00:12:31,541 --> 00:12:34,208
Public urination
on the outside of a Porta Potti?

303
00:12:34,291 --> 00:12:36,125
Really? That is so stupid.

304
00:12:36,208 --> 00:12:38,458
It's like you're begging me
to give you a citation.

305
00:12:38,541 --> 00:12:40,666
Oh, suck my cock, Ted.
Are are you serious?

306
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:42,791
-[beer can hisses]
-If people need to piss,

307
00:12:42,875 --> 00:12:44,791
they should be allowed to piss
where they want.

308
00:12:44,875 --> 00:12:46,583
Dog piss is way dirtier than mine.

309
00:12:46,666 --> 00:12:48,541
I don't see any fucking cops
giving them tickets.

310
00:12:48,625 --> 00:12:52,166
Now that I'm deputy of Sunnyvale,
I can change any fucking law I want.

311
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:54,416
I can't believe
how many stupid laws there were!

312
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:55,375
But not anymore.

313
00:12:55,458 --> 00:12:56,875
Bye-bye, stupid fucking laws.

314
00:12:56,958 --> 00:12:59,833
[Ricky] <i>I changed the age limits</i>
<i>for drinking and smoking dope to 10,</i>

315
00:12:59,916 --> 00:13:02,291
<i>which isn't that "Jurassic."</i>
<i>I started smoking when I was 8.</i>

316
00:13:02,708 --> 00:13:04,208
<i>And I changed the fucked-up gun laws.</i>

317
00:13:04,291 --> 00:13:06,791
<i>There's no reason why people</i>
<i>shouldn't be able to carry a gun</i>

318
00:13:06,875 --> 00:13:09,250
in public at all times.
It's fucking stupid!

319
00:13:09,333 --> 00:13:10,958
Here you go, Julian.

320
00:13:11,041 --> 00:13:15,125
Now that you're officially deputized,
you're fully authorized to sign this.

321
00:13:15,708 --> 00:13:16,541
Right on!

322
00:13:16,625 --> 00:13:21,041
This document allows us to rezone
any designated block of Sunnyvale.

323
00:13:21,125 --> 00:13:23,875
Okay, well, just a second here.
This block right here,

324
00:13:23,958 --> 00:13:26,583
that's up against the church.
And right there,

325
00:13:26,666 --> 00:13:29,375
-that's where the retirement home is.
-Exactly.

326
00:13:29,458 --> 00:13:31,750
We'll tear that down
and have one of the two casinos

327
00:13:31,833 --> 00:13:33,833
up and running there
by this time next year.

328
00:13:33,916 --> 00:13:35,000
Tear it down?

329
00:13:35,083 --> 00:13:37,541
But a lot of those old people
come from our park.

330
00:13:37,625 --> 00:13:40,041
I wouldn't worry.
Old people are very resourceful

331
00:13:40,125 --> 00:13:41,458
at finding new places to live.

332
00:13:41,916 --> 00:13:45,208
Oh, fuck. I don't know, I--
I don't know if I can sign this.

333
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:46,708
Sure you can.

334
00:13:46,791 --> 00:13:49,375
Look, the first signature
is always the hardest.

335
00:13:49,458 --> 00:13:52,916
They get a lot easier once the money
starts rolling in. Believe me.

336
00:13:54,666 --> 00:13:57,750
What the hell, Mayor?
We voted you in to help with our cats,

337
00:13:57,833 --> 00:13:59,875
and you've done shit! You suck!

338
00:13:59,958 --> 00:14:03,041
My cat is a medically prescribed
comfort cat!

339
00:14:03,125 --> 00:14:05,500
I'm very anxious without him!

340
00:14:05,583 --> 00:14:07,791
Sorry, everybody.
There's a lot of red tape

341
00:14:07,875 --> 00:14:10,250
to go through here.
This isn't as easy as you think!

342
00:14:10,333 --> 00:14:13,958
Fuck you, Shitler!
Don't gas our pets, you asshole!

343
00:14:14,041 --> 00:14:15,666
You're no cat lover!

344
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:21,000
You're just like every other suit dummy
that comes in here and lies to us

345
00:14:21,083 --> 00:14:22,958
so you can get into office.

346
00:14:23,041 --> 00:14:25,916
What? No!
Look, I love kitties more than anybody.

347
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,958
I got committee meetings set up,

348
00:14:28,041 --> 00:14:30,666
fucking board meetings
to take care of this, but…

349
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:33,666
Look, it's just gonna take
a little more time than I thought!

350
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:35,041
You're a kidnapper!

351
00:14:35,125 --> 00:14:36,625
-[chanting] Release our fucking pets!

352
00:14:36,708 --> 00:14:40,208
Fuck! I'm not a kidnapper,
I swear to fuck. I love kitties.

353
00:14:40,291 --> 00:14:41,208
I can't take this.

354
00:14:41,291 --> 00:14:44,208
I swear to fuck, I'm gonna fight
to get the kitties back,

355
00:14:44,291 --> 00:14:47,208
but… right now,
you gotta get the fuck out of my office

356
00:14:47,291 --> 00:14:49,208
so I can do my mayor stuff.

357
00:14:49,583 --> 00:14:50,666
[whimpering]

358
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:52,541
[engine roaring]

359
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:53,583
[siren]

360
00:14:53,666 --> 00:14:57,250
What the fuck is this guy doing?
You wanna play? Let's fucking play, then!

361
00:14:58,250 --> 00:14:59,291
Freeze! Don't move!

362
00:14:59,375 --> 00:15:02,083
How about you fuck off?
No way you would have caught me.

363
00:15:02,166 --> 00:15:04,500
I pulled over on purpose to let you know
how stupid you are.

364
00:15:04,583 --> 00:15:06,333
And while we're here,

365
00:15:06,416 --> 00:15:09,000
you may as well give me
a taint massage with your tongue.

366
00:15:09,083 --> 00:15:11,458
Sir, I advise you
to shut your filthy mouth.

367
00:15:11,541 --> 00:15:13,250
-Oh, yeah? Knock-knock.
-What?

368
00:15:13,333 --> 00:15:15,333
You're supposed to say, "Who's there?"
penis clamp.

369
00:15:16,333 --> 00:15:17,750
-Sir, do not--
-Say it!

370
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:18,958
Goddammit. Who's there?

371
00:15:19,041 --> 00:15:20,083
I'll tell you who's there.

372
00:15:20,166 --> 00:15:21,291
A fucking dumbass cop

373
00:15:21,375 --> 00:15:24,083
who's talking to the deputy fucking mayor
of Sunnyvale, that's who.

374
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:27,833
Okay, look, I'm…
[mumbling]

375
00:15:27,916 --> 00:15:31,166
And if you were actually doing your job,
instead of beating off in your cruiser,

376
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:32,250
eating fucking donuts,

377
00:15:32,333 --> 00:15:34,541
you'd know there's
no fucking speed limits anymore.

378
00:15:34,625 --> 00:15:38,541
{\an8}-Know what? Fuck you. You're suspended.
-Suspended? Come on, you can't--

379
00:15:38,625 --> 00:15:39,708
I just did.

380
00:15:39,791 --> 00:15:42,666
And because you're such an idiot,
the whole fucking force is now suspended!

381
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:43,583
Way to go, bud!

382
00:15:43,666 --> 00:15:46,083
-[stuttering] But…
-Let's go.

383
00:15:46,166 --> 00:15:48,625
Car keys and two smokes,
right the fuck now.

384
00:15:49,083 --> 00:15:51,541
[bulldozer engine rumbling]

385
00:15:51,625 --> 00:15:53,458
Didn't take long
to get everyone moved out, huh?

386
00:15:53,541 --> 00:15:56,000
Nah, we just sent them on the bus
to play bingo.

387
00:15:56,083 --> 00:15:58,500
I'm sure they'll work something out
when they get back.

388
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:01,541
[woman] Is that Julian?

389
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:05,208
-What the fuck am I doing?
-Fuck, I love running a city

390
00:16:05,291 --> 00:16:08,291
and getting rid of all that stupid shit
that pisses people off.

391
00:16:08,375 --> 00:16:09,250
{\an8}Do it, T!

392
00:16:09,333 --> 00:16:10,208
[smashing]

393
00:16:10,291 --> 00:16:12,291
Fuck having dumb lights to make you stop!

394
00:16:12,375 --> 00:16:16,041
The coolest thing, I get to use
fucking construction trucks when I want.

395
00:16:16,125 --> 00:16:17,916
Then, I can hire my friends,
triple overtime,

396
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,083
because the fucking city pays for it all.

397
00:16:20,666 --> 00:16:21,791
Okay, Reg,

398
00:16:21,875 --> 00:16:24,166
get that dirty whore
up on the hill, buddy!

399
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:25,916
-[crane beeping]
-What the frig?

400
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,875
-[metal creaking]
-Ricky!

401
00:16:28,875 --> 00:16:30,458
-[screaming]
-[seagulls cawing]

402
00:16:30,541 --> 00:16:31,500
What the frig?

403
00:16:32,375 --> 00:16:34,208
Frigging hole! Frig off!

404
00:16:34,833 --> 00:16:36,583
-[screaming]
-[seagulls cawing]

405
00:16:36,666 --> 00:16:38,041
Frig off! Stop pecking me,

406
00:16:38,125 --> 00:16:39,666
-you shit birds!
-[truck reversing]

407
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:42,291
What in the flying frig is happening here?

408
00:16:42,375 --> 00:16:43,750
What the frig?

409
00:16:43,833 --> 00:16:46,375
Reg! Easy, man, you're fucking up my shit!

410
00:16:46,458 --> 00:16:48,750
Ricky, what in the holy frig
are you doing?

411
00:16:48,833 --> 00:16:51,333
I'm about to put my trailer
up on that hill, Randy.

412
00:16:51,416 --> 00:16:54,000
I'll climb up to the height
where my cock's even with your lips

413
00:16:54,083 --> 00:16:55,833
so you can suck it without trying.

414
00:16:55,916 --> 00:16:58,208
-Sound good?
-What in the frig is wrong with you?

415
00:16:58,291 --> 00:17:00,208
-I told you, you can't do this!
-Really?

416
00:17:00,291 --> 00:17:02,666
I'm the deputy to the mayor,
so I can do what I want!

417
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:04,833
How do you like living
at the new city dump?

418
00:17:04,916 --> 00:17:07,291
Whoa, Reg! What the fuck's going on?

419
00:17:07,916 --> 00:17:09,666
Acid just kicked in, man!

420
00:17:10,333 --> 00:17:13,166
I think I got a Vietnam flashback
going on here.

421
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:16,000
What the fuck are you talking about?
You weren't even in Vietnam!

422
00:17:16,083 --> 00:17:17,500
Fuck yeah, I was!

423
00:17:17,583 --> 00:17:21,083
Me and the old lady
were on vacation there in '92.

424
00:17:21,166 --> 00:17:23,375
We fought the whole fucking time.

425
00:17:23,458 --> 00:17:26,041
That bitch was worse than the Viet Cong!

426
00:17:26,125 --> 00:17:27,833
-[crashing]
-[screaming]

427
00:17:27,916 --> 00:17:29,375
Oh, my fuck, Reg!

428
00:17:29,458 --> 00:17:31,750
You gotta shut it down!

429
00:17:32,166 --> 00:17:34,416
[T] I don't want a motherfucking house
falling on me.

430
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:37,416
Shit, where's Randy?
Get his belly to bounce the shit back.

431
00:17:38,875 --> 00:17:42,041
That where you want it,
you purple panda pussy poker?

432
00:17:42,125 --> 00:17:46,250
I dug deep into all this horseshit,
and I saw the kind of kickbacks

433
00:17:46,333 --> 00:17:48,416
Mayor Dodge was getting
through this kitty law.

434
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:49,916
It's a shit ton of money,

435
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,000
and I am shocked that y'all let it go on,
quite frankly.

436
00:17:53,083 --> 00:17:56,666
That being said,
I am officially putting forth a motion

437
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:59,708
to declare the cat law
heretofore be repealed

438
00:17:59,791 --> 00:18:02,750
and citizens no longer be required
to pay for their kitties.

439
00:18:02,833 --> 00:18:03,958
That's what's happening.

440
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:05,458
You're wasting your time.

441
00:18:05,541 --> 00:18:06,875
The cat law stays.

442
00:18:06,958 --> 00:18:10,500
Oh, you think so, do you,
You Keanu Reeves-sounding son of a whore?

443
00:18:10,583 --> 00:18:12,666
I think, then-- Maybe what I'll do--

444
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:14,625
Maybe I'll get the chief of police
on the phone,

445
00:18:14,708 --> 00:18:18,541
and I'll open up a fucking investigation
into all of you soulless bastards.

446
00:18:18,625 --> 00:18:20,958
-How does that sound?
-And how do you plan on doing that

447
00:18:21,041 --> 00:18:24,125
now that you suspended
the entire Sunnyvale police force?

448
00:18:24,208 --> 00:18:26,625
-What? What are you talking about?
-You're the mayor!

449
00:18:26,708 --> 00:18:28,708
Are you not aware
of what's happening in Sunnyvale?

450
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:29,875
[groans]

451
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:33,458
I might not be completely aware
of all things,

452
00:18:33,541 --> 00:18:34,791
-but it's a lot of--
-[explosion]

453
00:18:34,875 --> 00:18:37,041
Mother Mary's hairy bush!

454
00:18:37,625 --> 00:18:39,791
-What the fuck's going on out there?
-[screaming]

455
00:18:39,875 --> 00:18:41,875
-[sirens]
-[woman screams]

-[crashing]
-[gunshots]

457
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,791
[Steve Rogers] There's a complete sense
of lawlessness and chaos

458
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:48,875
here in downtown Sunnyvale.

459
00:18:48,958 --> 00:18:51,958
As buildings old and new
are being torn down.

460
00:18:52,041 --> 00:18:55,458
Never before have we seen
such mass destruction.

461
00:18:55,541 --> 00:18:58,458
From what this newscaster,
Steve Rogers, understands,

462
00:18:58,583 --> 00:19:02,666
{\an8}<i>it's the result of the downtown core</i>
<i>being rezoned for casinos.</i>

463
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:04,833
{\an8}<i>We're hoping Mayor Bubbles can explain--</i>

464
00:19:04,916 --> 00:19:06,083
-[bottle crashing]
-[screams]

465
00:19:06,166 --> 00:19:08,000
{\an8}-[laughter]
<i>-Fuck me hard!</i>

466
00:19:08,083 --> 00:19:09,541
{\an8}<i>That really hurt.</i>

467
00:19:09,625 --> 00:19:11,458
{\an8}[driver] <i>Fuck you, Steve Rogers!</i>

468
00:19:11,541 --> 00:19:16,708
{\an8}<i>I'm Steve "Bleeding Profusely</i>
<i>and Losing Consciousness" Rogers--</i>

469
00:19:16,791 --> 00:19:17,625
[splat]

470
00:19:18,208 --> 00:19:22,166
What the fuck do you suggest we do here?
It's like fucking Armageddon out there.

471
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:24,500
What are you talking about?
It's way better than it was.

472
00:19:24,583 --> 00:19:26,416
People are a lot fucking happier.
I know that.

473
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:27,833
Jesus Murphy!

474
00:19:28,291 --> 00:19:30,708
Boys,
I'm open to fucking suggestions here!

475
00:19:30,791 --> 00:19:32,875
Just so you know,
I had nothing to do with this.

476
00:19:32,958 --> 00:19:34,666
Maybe we should let
one of the suit dummies

477
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:36,083
take care of all this shit.

478
00:19:36,166 --> 00:19:37,875
Julian! Ricky! Don't you move.

479
00:19:37,958 --> 00:19:40,666
-You're under arrest!
-Fuck. Now what's going on?

480
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:42,958
Bubbles, I'm sorry,
but I gotta take these two in.

481
00:19:43,041 --> 00:19:43,916
-Bullshit!
-Why?

482
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,708
Abuse of power,
misappropriation of funds,

483
00:19:46,791 --> 00:19:49,375
inciting a riot,
destruction of public property...

484
00:19:49,458 --> 00:19:51,166
-Do you want me to keep going?
-No.

485
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:53,416
That sounds like plenty of shit,
but you can't--

486
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:55,916
Yeah, their bullshit
is what did this to the city.

487
00:19:56,041 --> 00:19:57,208
And I'm taking them in for it.

488
00:19:57,291 --> 00:20:00,000
I can't fucking believe you guys did this.

489
00:20:00,083 --> 00:20:03,416
I give you one ounce of fucking power,
and inside the course of a week,

490
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:05,541
you systematically brought
all of Sunnyvale

491
00:20:05,625 --> 00:20:06,791
right to its fucking knees!

492
00:20:06,875 --> 00:20:08,875
I don't know
if this is really our fucking fault.

493
00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:11,250
You're the goddamn mayor.
You should have seen this coming.

494
00:20:11,333 --> 00:20:13,833
Maybe it was a bad idea for you
to just focus on the cat thing.

495
00:20:13,916 --> 00:20:15,208
Ricky's right in a way here.

496
00:20:15,291 --> 00:20:18,000
Oh, my fuck! So, this is <i>my</i> fault, right?

497
00:20:18,083 --> 00:20:19,583
You two took advantage of me.

498
00:20:19,666 --> 00:20:22,083
You trampled all over me
with your big, mean shoes.

499
00:20:22,166 --> 00:20:25,416
And you did it just to squeeze everything
you fucking could out of the city

500
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:28,625
for yourselves.
You two are worse than the cat takers.

501
00:20:28,708 --> 00:20:31,333
But I thought you gave me authority
to do whatever the fuck I want.

502
00:20:31,416 --> 00:20:32,833
No, I did not, Ricky!

503
00:20:32,916 --> 00:20:35,625
I gave you the authority
to be deputy mayor.

504
00:20:35,708 --> 00:20:38,166
That's basically
just glorified pothole duty,

505
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:41,541
not "I make up
whatever fucking laws I want" guy.

506
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:43,625
Come on, you two. Let's go.

507
00:20:43,708 --> 00:20:46,416
Just fucking wait, Ted.
What happens to them now?

508
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:49,458
They're going to jail
for as long as I can put them there for.

509
00:20:49,541 --> 00:20:53,625
But I could use my power as mayor
to exonerate them, right?

510
00:20:53,708 --> 00:20:56,416
Exonerate us? Fuck.
That's harsh, don't you think?

511
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:59,500
You could let them go, I suppose,
but that would be obstruction of justice.

512
00:20:59,583 --> 00:21:01,583
And with the way
public opinion is right now,

513
00:21:01,666 --> 00:21:04,291
you'd get slaughtered in the press,
and you'd have to resign anyway.

514
00:21:04,375 --> 00:21:07,458
Oh, I can't leave the mayor's office.

515
00:21:07,541 --> 00:21:10,291
I haven't repealed the kitty bill yet.

516
00:21:10,375 --> 00:21:12,000
Come on, this is a no-brainer.

517
00:21:12,083 --> 00:21:14,708
Yeah, man, think about it.
It's us or your cats.

518
00:21:14,791 --> 00:21:16,416
Yeah, you're right.

519
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:17,958
It's a no-brainer.

520
00:21:18,291 --> 00:21:19,208
[cell door slamming]

521
00:21:20,125 --> 00:21:22,333
On paper, the casinos were a great idea.

522
00:21:22,416 --> 00:21:26,416
But, you know, maybe I'm not as smart
of a businessman as I thought I was.

523
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:29,875
I guess I got a lot of studying to do
to make myself better and smarter.

524
00:21:29,958 --> 00:21:32,875
You know what? I think coming to jail
this time is a good thing for me.

525
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:36,083
Being the boss can suck my cock.
It's a lot of fucking work.

526
00:21:36,166 --> 00:21:39,083
I tried, and look what happened.
Everything got fucked up big-time.

527
00:21:39,166 --> 00:21:40,333
The old man always use to say,

528
00:21:40,416 --> 00:21:42,833
"Unless you're forced to,
or unless you really have to,

529
00:21:42,916 --> 00:21:44,833
don't fucking work. Ever."

530
00:21:44,916 --> 00:21:47,875
[door buzzing open]

531
00:21:47,958 --> 00:21:49,625
-Bubs!
-Hey, boys!

532
00:21:49,708 --> 00:21:51,416
You got your cats back! Good for you.

533
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:52,458
Fucking right, I did.

534
00:21:52,541 --> 00:21:55,000
I took a lot of heat
from those arseholes in city hall,

535
00:21:55,083 --> 00:21:56,083
but I fought hard,

536
00:21:56,166 --> 00:21:58,458
and I got that whore
of a kitty law repealed.

537
00:21:58,541 --> 00:21:59,541
Right on, man.

538
00:21:59,625 --> 00:22:03,125
Listen, I just want to thank you guys
for stepping up

539
00:22:03,208 --> 00:22:04,583
to go to jail like you did.

540
00:22:04,666 --> 00:22:08,125
-We didn't wanna make you decide.
-We know how important your kitties are.

541
00:22:08,208 --> 00:22:09,916
We didn't want you to be without them.
Fuck.

542
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,208
So you know, once we're out,

543
00:22:11,291 --> 00:22:13,500
we're not gonna fuck around
with your mayor stuff anymore.

544
00:22:13,583 --> 00:22:15,625
Well, that doesn't even matter,
actually, Ricky,

545
00:22:15,708 --> 00:22:16,958
'cause I fucking resigned.

546
00:22:17,041 --> 00:22:18,791
-No, you didn't. Why'd you do that?
-What?

547
00:22:18,875 --> 00:22:20,750
Well, once I got the kitty law repealed,

548
00:22:20,833 --> 00:22:23,541
there was only thing left for me to do
as mayor anyway.

549
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:25,625
Are you gonna guess?

550
00:22:25,708 --> 00:22:26,833
-What is it?
-What?

551
00:22:26,916 --> 00:22:28,708
Get my two best friends pardoned!
[laughs]

552
00:22:28,791 --> 00:22:30,083
No fucking way!

553
00:22:30,166 --> 00:22:31,375
-You're free to go!
-Thanks!

554
00:22:31,458 --> 00:22:33,000
-Free to go!
-Oh, my fuck.

555
00:22:33,083 --> 00:22:34,750
Are you fucking serious? We have to leave?

556
00:22:34,833 --> 00:22:37,166
What? You wanna stay in here, Ricky?

557
00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:38,916
It's totally different here.
They renovated.

558
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,708
The kitchen's awesome.
They got a new cook.

559
00:22:40,791 --> 00:22:42,208
-Chili's unbelievable.
-Who gives a fuck?

560
00:22:42,291 --> 00:22:43,791
-New hockey sticks…
-It's jail!

561
00:22:43,875 --> 00:22:45,791
-You know what? No, Bubs.
-New fucking mattresses!

562
00:22:45,875 --> 00:22:46,875
Bubs, fuck him.

563
00:22:46,958 --> 00:22:49,458
When I get out, I'm gonna get
a fucking huge bunch of chicken,

564
00:22:49,541 --> 00:22:52,041
a bunch of booze, and we're gonna have
a huge chicken party.

565
00:22:52,125 --> 00:22:55,500
-Fucking right, we are! Chicken party!
-Not without me.

566
00:22:55,583 --> 00:22:59,125
I am not turning down a chicken party
or delaying one.

567
00:22:59,208 --> 00:23:01,041
Fucking Jesus. Goddamnit!

568
00:23:01,125 --> 00:23:03,083
Alright, let's fucking go home, I guess.

569
00:23:03,166 --> 00:23:05,000
Yes! Chicken party!

570
00:23:05,083 --> 00:23:06,125
I want all the skin.

571
00:23:06,208 --> 00:23:10,208
[piano theme music playing]

572
00:24:09,458 --> 00:24:11,458
[seagulls cawing]

573
00:24:11,541 --> 00:24:13,541
[waves splashing]

574
00:24:13,625 --> 00:24:15,625
[engine chugging]

575
00:24:24,791 --> 00:24:30,291
[voices] Oh, fuck.

576
00:24:30,375 --> 00:24:31,916
Jesus Christ!

577
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:36,875
[whooshing]

578
00:24:37,916 --> 00:24:39,125
[man whispers] <i>Fuck off.</i>

1
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:12,250
-[buzzer sounds]
-[gate screeches]

2
00:00:12,666 --> 00:00:14,833
See you in a couple months,
I'm sure, Ricky.

3
00:00:14,916 --> 00:00:16,458
Fuck your own cock there, Jerry.

4
00:00:16,541 --> 00:00:20,375
-You got any more of that Moroccan left?
-Yeah, got a little piece here. Ten bucks.

5
00:00:20,458 --> 00:00:21,333
Fucking blow me!

6
00:00:22,791 --> 00:00:24,041
Jesus Christ, seriously?

7
00:00:24,125 --> 00:00:26,166
I'm gonna need you
to fuck off there, okay?

8
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:29,250
[distorted] I said,
I need you to fuck off, please!

9
00:00:29,583 --> 00:00:30,583
[man] Hey, watch it!

10
00:00:30,666 --> 00:00:32,583
-[car brakes]
-[Bubbles and Julian] Hey, Ricky!

11
00:00:32,666 --> 00:00:34,541
-[Ricky] What's up, buddy?
-[Julian] Boys!

12
00:00:34,625 --> 00:00:38,291
Holy fuck, it's good to see you.
That two weeks felt like two months.

13
00:00:38,375 --> 00:00:40,250
-Shit.
-You didn't miss much, though.

14
00:00:40,333 --> 00:00:44,416
I got baby skunks born behind my shed.
And Marguerite shit herself at the park

15
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:46,916
barbecue 'cause there was too much vinegar
in the coleslaw.

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,708
-How was prison?
-It was fucking awesome.

17
00:00:48,791 --> 00:00:50,958
-Check this out!
-Oh, right on!

18
00:00:51,041 --> 00:00:52,958
-Holy fuck, you won!
-Congratulations, buddy!

19
00:00:53,041 --> 00:00:54,333
-Yeah!
-You won the big trophy!

20
00:00:54,833 --> 00:00:56,958
I came to jail
to play in the ball hockey tournament,

21
00:00:57,041 --> 00:00:58,000
and we fucking won.

22
00:00:58,083 --> 00:00:59,916
Which, normally,
would be the highlight of jail,

23
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,458
but this time was even awesomer
than normal because I got this.

24
00:01:02,541 --> 00:01:05,375
This little baby right here,
this could be my retirement.

25
00:01:05,458 --> 00:01:06,625
Well, for five years, anyway.

26
00:01:06,708 --> 00:01:08,250
Shit like this doesn't come along often,

27
00:01:08,333 --> 00:01:10,500
so if I lay my cards right,
I could be fucking set.

28
00:01:10,583 --> 00:01:13,125
But you can't tell Julian and Bubbles
about this, okay, guys?

29
00:01:13,208 --> 00:01:15,125
'Cause they'll just fuck it up on me,
like always.

30
00:01:15,208 --> 00:01:17,041
Holy fuck, I'm excited, boys.

31
00:01:17,125 --> 00:01:19,791
Chinese food
and PS2 wrasslin' tonight, Ricky!

32
00:01:19,875 --> 00:01:21,625
-Tons of dope and liquor, buddy.
-[grunts]

33
00:01:21,708 --> 00:01:23,916
No sweet and power for me, boys.
Not tonight.

34
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:24,833
What?

35
00:01:24,916 --> 00:01:26,291
-What are you talking about?
-What?

36
00:01:26,375 --> 00:01:28,750
My partying days are over.
I'm getting too old for this shit.

37
00:01:28,833 --> 00:01:29,666
Oh, come on!

38
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:32,791
Too old for chicken balls
and PS2 wrasslin' games?

39
00:01:32,875 --> 00:01:35,125
Too old to be getting arrested
for junior-high stuff.

40
00:01:35,541 --> 00:01:38,250
Ricky got fucked up with Reggie
on liquor, mushrooms, and acid,

41
00:01:38,333 --> 00:01:40,000
and that's when he does the dumbest shit.

42
00:01:40,083 --> 00:01:42,833
Says he doesn't remember exactly
how he got in there, but…

43
00:01:42,916 --> 00:01:44,833
<i>him and Reggie</i>
<i>ended up down at 'tucky Fried,</i>

44
00:01:44,916 --> 00:01:46,750
<i>up in the giant bucket on top of the pole.</i>

45
00:01:46,833 --> 00:01:49,041
So, the cops showed up,
and because Ricky was on acid,

46
00:01:49,125 --> 00:01:52,041
he thought the fucking cars were on fire
because of all the flashing lights.

47
00:01:52,125 --> 00:01:54,000
So, what does he do?
He starts pissing on them.

48
00:01:54,083 --> 00:01:55,500
Holy fuck, boys, okay.

49
00:01:55,583 --> 00:01:56,916
Hold on a second. Don't worry!

50
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,208
{\an8}I got a fire hose right here.
I'll fucking save you!

51
00:01:59,291 --> 00:02:02,083
Yep, pissed right on both the cops' faces.

52
00:02:02,166 --> 00:02:05,083
I was fucking positive they were on fire.
I really was.

53
00:02:05,166 --> 00:02:07,250
I need to grow up. I really do.
I'm fucked.

54
00:02:07,333 --> 00:02:08,791
That's just jail talking, Ricky.

55
00:02:08,875 --> 00:02:10,708
You'll be back to normal in a couple days.

56
00:02:10,791 --> 00:02:13,791
I don't know, man.
I'm pretty fucked up over shit this time.

57
00:02:13,875 --> 00:02:16,750
What? Where's this all coming from, Ricky?

58
00:02:16,833 --> 00:02:20,666
It's just different this time.
I think I just need to be a better person.

59
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:23,375
And how in the fuck do you plan
on being a better person?

60
00:02:23,458 --> 00:02:24,625
I was thinking about it.

61
00:02:24,708 --> 00:02:27,625
I promised Cory that I'd hang out with him
for a whole day, so…

62
00:02:27,708 --> 00:02:29,291
that might be a good place to start.

63
00:02:29,375 --> 00:02:31,541
You're serious?
You're gonna hang out with Cory?

64
00:02:31,625 --> 00:02:34,166
Hang out for a whole day?
Just the two of you?

65
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:36,541
-Oh, Jesus.
-If that's the kind of thing I gotta do

66
00:02:36,625 --> 00:02:38,000
to be a better person, yeah.

67
00:02:38,083 --> 00:02:40,166
I ever, never thought
I'd speakle these words...

68
00:02:40,583 --> 00:02:43,166
but I'm gonna start hanging out with Cory
from now on, boys.

69
00:02:43,583 --> 00:02:44,416
Oh!

70
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:49,083
[piano theme music playing]

72
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:57,416
Cory! What's up, man?
What the fuck are you doing?

73
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:01,291
What's up, dude? I'm just over here
catching frogs. Talkin' to 'em and shit.

74
00:03:01,375 --> 00:03:05,166
That sounds fucked! Anyway,
just get the fuck over here, alright?

75
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:07,541
-Yeah.
-Remember when I promised you

76
00:03:07,625 --> 00:03:10,875
I'd spend a day with you hanging out?
Well, today's the fucking day.

77
00:03:10,958 --> 00:03:14,083
No way! Are you serious, dude?
We're gonna hang out all day?

78
00:03:14,166 --> 00:03:16,375
Yeah, all day and all fucking night.

79
00:03:16,458 --> 00:03:17,833
Oh, my God, that's awesome.

80
00:03:17,916 --> 00:03:20,375
We can go get chips and pops.
We can play video games.

81
00:03:20,458 --> 00:03:22,791
-Oh, shit! Maybe we could--
-No, fuck all that shit.

82
00:03:22,875 --> 00:03:24,125
We're going treasure hunting.

83
00:03:24,208 --> 00:03:27,375
No way! Treasure hunting, dude!
That's dope.

84
00:03:27,458 --> 00:03:30,541
I always wanted to go treasure hunting.
We gotta go get Jacob right now.

85
00:03:30,625 --> 00:03:32,416
No, no fucking way.

86
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:35,541
The kind of treasure hunting we're doing,
Jacob can't know about. Nor can Trin.

87
00:03:35,625 --> 00:03:38,750
-Please, dude! I promise we could--
-What the fuck did I just say?

88
00:03:38,833 --> 00:03:41,333
It's me and you. No fucking Jacob.
Take it or leave it.

89
00:03:41,416 --> 00:03:43,250
Go back to sucking frog cocks if you want.

90
00:03:43,333 --> 00:03:45,083
-I can't do it, dude.
-What?

91
00:03:45,166 --> 00:03:47,875
What the fuck did you just say?
Are you fucking joking?

92
00:03:47,958 --> 00:03:50,666
I'm offering to hang out, just you and me,
and you're turning me down?

93
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:54,000
I'm sorry, but I do everything with Jacob,
and if I don't do this one,

94
00:03:54,083 --> 00:03:56,375
then it could fuck him up.
He'd be put in a coma.

95
00:03:56,833 --> 00:03:59,791
You are fucked. Fuck you, then!
So you know, I was thinking about

96
00:03:59,875 --> 00:04:01,875
high-fiving you today. Nice fuck-up!

97
00:04:01,958 --> 00:04:04,250
I'm sorry, dude, but Jacob's all I got.

98
00:04:04,333 --> 00:04:05,750
I can't risk this shit.

99
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:10,625
Goddammit! You know what? You're right.
We'll go get Jacob.

100
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:11,541
It's all good.

101
00:04:11,625 --> 00:04:12,583
Yeah?

102
00:04:12,666 --> 00:04:16,916
Not a fucking cha-- Put that fucking hand
down right now! Get the fuck in the car.

103
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,375
And wipe that frog jizz off your hands.
I don't want any on my seats.

104
00:04:20,458 --> 00:04:23,666
I never thought I'd see the fucking day.
He's actually doing it.

105
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:26,500
Ricky is hanging out with Cory.
What in the fuck?

106
00:04:26,583 --> 00:04:29,250
-He sure is, man.
-Just doesn't make any sense.

107
00:04:29,333 --> 00:04:31,500
He's been to jail more times
than I can count.

108
00:04:31,583 --> 00:04:33,333
Why is this time any different?

109
00:04:33,416 --> 00:04:36,625
Hate to say it, Bubs, but… I think
something happened to him in jail.

110
00:04:36,708 --> 00:04:38,541
Something happened? What do you mean?

111
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:40,250
Something happened.

112
00:04:40,333 --> 00:04:41,875
Oh, my fuck. You mean…

113
00:04:42,291 --> 00:04:43,125
something…

114
00:04:43,666 --> 00:04:44,500
happened?

115
00:04:44,583 --> 00:04:47,916
Jails are harder than they used to be.
Guys going in are younger and stronger

116
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,208
and fucking crazier. A lot of them
are fucking MMA fighters, man.

117
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:54,083
Are you telling me you think Ricky
got a ground-and-pound?

118
00:04:54,166 --> 00:04:55,916
Yep. I can see it in his eyes, man.

119
00:04:56,083 --> 00:04:57,291
Oh, my God.

120
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,458
-Oh, my God, poor Ricky!
-Yeah.

121
00:05:02,541 --> 00:05:04,541
Well, what the fuck are you waiting for?

122
00:05:04,625 --> 00:05:05,750
Just fucking ask him.

123
00:05:06,208 --> 00:05:08,875
Hey, dude. You know,
I'm hanging out with Ricky today.

124
00:05:08,958 --> 00:05:10,125
Like, all day.

125
00:05:10,208 --> 00:05:12,750
And I'm wondering
if you wanna hang out with us!

126
00:05:12,833 --> 00:05:14,208
What? Is this a trick?

127
00:05:14,291 --> 00:05:17,666
Yeah, what's going on, Dad?
I don't believe this for a second.

128
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:20,916
Nothing's going on. I was just thinking
a lot in jail this time, and…

129
00:05:21,208 --> 00:05:23,250
I've treated these guys bad
because they're dicks,

130
00:05:23,333 --> 00:05:25,500
and they're fucking dumb
and annoying, and…

131
00:05:25,583 --> 00:05:28,708
I just got it thinked out that…
I wanna for to be a better person.

132
00:05:28,791 --> 00:05:30,958
I thought we could try hanging out,
and maybe blond or…

133
00:05:31,041 --> 00:05:32,291
whatever it's called. Do that.

134
00:05:32,375 --> 00:05:34,500
Dad, this is amazing. Thank you so much.

135
00:05:34,583 --> 00:05:36,375
I can't tell you how happy it makes me

136
00:05:36,458 --> 00:05:39,666
that you're gonna spend more time
with Jacob and be nicer to them both.

137
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:42,666
Yep, I'm turning over a new belief,
and it feels fucking great.

138
00:05:44,083 --> 00:05:46,625
All right,
you useless sack of fucking dick flakes.

139
00:05:46,708 --> 00:05:48,916
Treasure hunting time.
Grab the shit and let's go.

140
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,041
No way. We're treasure hunting? What for?

141
00:05:51,125 --> 00:05:53,125
I can't tell you,
or it wouldn't be called treasure,

142
00:05:53,208 --> 00:05:55,208
and we wouldn't be hunting it.
I swear to fuck

143
00:05:55,291 --> 00:05:57,791
your brain is made up of corn on the cob
and fucking rocks.

144
00:05:58,208 --> 00:06:00,708
[Ricky echoing] This place gives me
the fucking creaks.

145
00:06:00,791 --> 00:06:04,208
-Yea, it's like horror-movie shit in here.
-Feels more like <i>Scooby-Doo.</i>

146
00:06:04,291 --> 00:06:06,708
That's because
your brain is Scooby-fucked, Jacob.

147
00:06:06,791 --> 00:06:09,875
Okay, hang on.
It says, "Go until you see main…

148
00:06:09,958 --> 00:06:11,916
sewer cross pipe, which goes…

149
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:12,833
left to right.

150
00:06:12,916 --> 00:06:14,791
Tunnel entrance will be aprix…

151
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:17,500
apro..."

152
00:06:17,583 --> 00:06:18,708
Approximate, dude.

153
00:06:18,791 --> 00:06:21,416
"…will be in approximate 250 yards."

154
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:23,750
That must be
this fucking thing right here.

155
00:06:23,833 --> 00:06:25,416
So, what way, dude? Right or left?

156
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,625
I think it means you go straight ahead,
doesn't it?

157
00:06:27,708 --> 00:06:29,541
Why would he bother saying
"left to right"?

158
00:06:29,625 --> 00:06:32,416
I think he means
go to the right 250 yards, wouldn't he?

159
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:36,000
No, dude, he means
start at the left 250 yards and go right.

160
00:06:36,083 --> 00:06:38,458
Yeah, but if you start in there 250 yards,

161
00:06:38,541 --> 00:06:41,625
and then go back 250 yards,
wouldn't you be back here?

162
00:06:41,708 --> 00:06:43,125
Or maybe you'd be down there.

163
00:06:43,208 --> 00:06:45,208
-No, then you'd be 400 yards.
-Holy fuck!

164
00:06:45,291 --> 00:06:46,708
Would you two shut the fuck up?

165
00:06:46,791 --> 00:06:49,541
Cory, you go down that one.
Jacob, you go down that one.

166
00:06:49,625 --> 00:06:51,291
If you see a hand-dug tunnel, yell for me.

167
00:06:51,375 --> 00:06:53,833
I'm going straight ahead,
like a fucking smartly person would.

168
00:06:53,916 --> 00:06:57,291
I swear, your two brains added together
wouldn't make a fucking sandwich.

169
00:06:58,041 --> 00:06:59,500
Dude, I'm not going down there alone.

170
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:01,083
Well, I'm not going down there alone.

171
00:07:01,166 --> 00:07:04,416
Let's go down this one together,
and then we'll go down that one together.

172
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,041
Okay, totally. Let's go.

173
00:07:06,125 --> 00:07:08,500
[sloshing footsteps]

174
00:07:08,583 --> 00:07:10,916
[upbeat piano music]

175
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,708
Wow, Jeremy, I'm impressed.
I've never seen anyone

176
00:07:13,791 --> 00:07:16,250
bring their own grilling kit
on a date before.

177
00:07:16,333 --> 00:07:17,375
[sizzling]

178
00:07:17,458 --> 00:07:18,875
That grease is hot.

179
00:07:18,958 --> 00:07:21,458
Oh, here.
Let me get that for you, big guy.

180
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:22,458
[Jeremy giggles]

181
00:07:24,041 --> 00:07:26,875
[music swells]

182
00:07:26,958 --> 00:07:29,250
-[Jeremy moans]
-[Randy moans]

183
00:07:30,375 --> 00:07:34,083
Maybe we should move the burgers
up to the top rack and turn down the heat.

184
00:07:35,125 --> 00:07:37,625
And then go inside and turn up the heat.

185
00:07:37,708 --> 00:07:40,166
-[music fades out]
-[hissing]

186
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:41,208
What's this, Randy?

187
00:07:42,375 --> 00:07:44,625
Well,
this is a fucking fine kettle of a fish.

188
00:07:46,208 --> 00:07:48,666
All right, come on, you cocksucker.
Where are you?

189
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:50,208
-[squishing]
-[Randy screams]

190
00:07:50,291 --> 00:07:51,666
What the fuck was that?

191
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:52,583
Goddammit!

192
00:07:52,666 --> 00:07:53,500
[echoing]

193
00:07:53,583 --> 00:07:55,916
Oh, fuck yeah!
There you are, you little slut!

194
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,125
The dirty fucking hole of my retirement!

195
00:07:59,208 --> 00:08:00,041
Yes!

196
00:08:00,458 --> 00:08:02,458
Boys, I found it! Let's go!

197
00:08:03,625 --> 00:08:05,000
Oh, for fuck's sakes!

198
00:08:06,291 --> 00:08:07,125
Boys!

199
00:08:07,541 --> 00:08:08,916
Where the fuck did you go?

200
00:08:09,958 --> 00:08:11,916
Where the fuck are you, stupid cunts?

201
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:17,041
[distant screaming]

202
00:08:17,125 --> 00:08:18,750
What the fuck? What's happening?

203
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:22,541
What's going on? Are you guys okay?
Oh, yeah, fuck this.

204
00:08:22,625 --> 00:08:24,458
-[pounding footsteps]
-Good luck, boys!

205
00:08:27,625 --> 00:08:29,500
How's it going, Ricky? Are you okay?

206
00:08:30,041 --> 00:08:33,500
[sighs] Listen, boys,
there's something I didn't tell you guys

207
00:08:33,583 --> 00:08:35,750
because I thought I could deal with it,
but I can't.

208
00:08:35,833 --> 00:08:38,833
Ricky, it's okay.
Do you wanna talk about it?

209
00:08:38,916 --> 00:08:41,416
Well, I don't want to,
but I think I might need help.

210
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:43,458
Let's say there was some holes
and some pipes,

211
00:08:43,541 --> 00:08:45,916
and some people went in there
who shouldn't have and…

212
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,375
-Fuck.
-It's-- Look, it's okay, Ricky.

213
00:08:48,458 --> 00:08:51,166
-We'll get through this together.
-Yeah, we're here for you.

214
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:53,000
Really? Wow.

215
00:08:53,083 --> 00:08:54,291
I wasn't expecting that.

216
00:08:54,375 --> 00:08:57,916
Oh, it's not your fault, Ricky.
Let's make that clear right away.

217
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,875
No, I know,
but Trinity's gonna fucking lose it.

218
00:08:59,958 --> 00:09:02,666
Trinity?
Rick, you don't have to tell Trinity, man.

219
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:03,875
Definitely not, Ricky.

220
00:09:03,958 --> 00:09:04,958
Seriously?

221
00:09:05,041 --> 00:09:07,375
She's probably gonna find out
sooner or later, no?

222
00:09:07,458 --> 00:09:10,333
Well, she doesn't need to.
I mean, I'm not gonna tell her,

223
00:09:10,416 --> 00:09:11,916
-he's not telling.
-I'm not telling.

224
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,958
There's some things a daughter
just doesn't need to know.

225
00:09:15,041 --> 00:09:16,416
Well, I guess you're right.

226
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,541
It's not that big of a deal
when you think about it like that.

227
00:09:19,625 --> 00:09:21,291
I'm glad I talked to you guys about this.

228
00:09:21,375 --> 00:09:23,166
I'm feeling way better now
about everything.

229
00:09:23,708 --> 00:09:26,291
-I hope they're not dead, but, yeah.
-Dead? Ricky, what the fuck

230
00:09:26,375 --> 00:09:29,083
-are you talking about, "dead"?
-Who's dead, Ricky?

231
00:09:30,875 --> 00:09:31,791
[sloshing]

232
00:09:31,875 --> 00:09:35,125
I can't fucking believe you guys thought
I got bagshanked in jail!

233
00:09:35,208 --> 00:09:38,833
Well, sorry, but all signs pointed
to the fact that you got prison-humped!

234
00:09:38,916 --> 00:09:41,708
What were you doing in the sewer
with them in the first place?

235
00:09:41,791 --> 00:09:44,958
I didn't want to tell you,
but I met a guy in jail who dug a tunnel

236
00:09:45,041 --> 00:09:47,125
underneath the cigarette
and liquor lockup at Costco.

237
00:09:47,208 --> 00:09:48,208
He's in for ten years now,

238
00:09:48,291 --> 00:09:50,166
so he told me if I give him
cartons of smokes,

239
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:51,958
-he'd give me the map.
-Oh, yeah.

240
00:09:52,041 --> 00:09:56,125
This is making sense. So, when you told us
you just wanted to be a better person,

241
00:09:56,208 --> 00:09:58,541
-you were using that as an excuse…
-No.

242
00:09:58,625 --> 00:10:02,333
…to rob cigarettes and liquor
out of the Costco with Cory and Jacob!

243
00:10:02,416 --> 00:10:05,208
Why the fuck didn't you tell me, at least?
I could help you make

244
00:10:05,291 --> 00:10:06,583
a shit-ton of money off this.

245
00:10:06,666 --> 00:10:08,625
No. That's exactly why
I didn't wanna tell you.

246
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:10,833
My brain also said,
"Ricky, Julian's problem

247
00:10:10,916 --> 00:10:13,375
is that he's always looking
for the big score to retire.

248
00:10:13,458 --> 00:10:15,125
But Julian's not as smart as you."

249
00:10:15,208 --> 00:10:17,375
Or me, or whoever is doing
the fucking talking here.

250
00:10:17,458 --> 00:10:19,583
So, brain said,
"Retire for five years at a time,

251
00:10:19,666 --> 00:10:20,916
and there's a less bigger chance

252
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,250
-of going to jail."
-Whatever.

253
00:10:22,333 --> 00:10:24,291
Come on, buddy.
If you help do this with me,

254
00:10:24,375 --> 00:10:27,041
I promise, no illegal shit
for five fucking years.

255
00:10:27,125 --> 00:10:29,041
Ricky, I don't think
the most pressing issue

256
00:10:29,125 --> 00:10:32,250
is getting your stolen cigarettes
and liquor at a fucking Costco right now.

257
00:10:32,333 --> 00:10:33,833
We have to find Cory and Jacob

258
00:10:33,916 --> 00:10:35,750
before they get eaten
by a fucking sewer lizard,

259
00:10:35,833 --> 00:10:39,416
-or whatever got the fuck a hold of them.
-They'll find their own way out, okay?

260
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:41,125
And there's no such thing
as sewer lizards.

261
00:10:41,208 --> 00:10:42,750
Yeah, you tell that to all the people

262
00:10:42,833 --> 00:10:44,791
who've been eaten
by the dirty cocksuckers, then.

263
00:10:44,875 --> 00:10:46,125
Something had a hold of them.

264
00:10:46,208 --> 00:10:47,875
They were thrashing and screaming in pain.

265
00:10:47,958 --> 00:10:50,291
-I could hear water going. It was fucked--
-Sewer lizards!

266
00:10:50,375 --> 00:10:53,750
But they're probably gonna be fine.
They're too dumb to get dead.

267
00:10:53,833 --> 00:10:56,000
I agree. Let's just go check out
this booze room.

268
00:10:56,083 --> 00:10:57,375
No, that's it, boys.

269
00:10:57,458 --> 00:11:01,375
We are looking for Cory and Jacob
until we find them. Case closed.

270
00:11:01,458 --> 00:11:03,041
Yeah, fuck. He's probably right.

271
00:11:03,125 --> 00:11:05,000
We should look for them,
in case Trin asks.

272
00:11:05,083 --> 00:11:08,083
All right, for fuck's sakes. Let's try…

273
00:11:08,583 --> 00:11:10,375
-down this way, then.
-Perfect.

274
00:11:10,458 --> 00:11:12,833
Cory, Jacob! Where are you?

275
00:11:12,916 --> 00:11:15,125
Boys! Where the fuck did you go?

276
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:16,041
[echoing]

277
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:19,208
I'm sorry I freaked you out earlier,
but I seriously thought

278
00:11:19,291 --> 00:11:22,000
that rope was a 100-foot snake
trying to choke us out.

279
00:11:22,083 --> 00:11:23,041
Yeah, I did too.

280
00:11:23,125 --> 00:11:24,375
It was definitely choke-y.

281
00:11:24,458 --> 00:11:25,708
I was sure it was moving.

282
00:11:25,791 --> 00:11:27,708
Well, it was moving, dude. It just…

283
00:11:27,791 --> 00:11:29,708
I mean, I was moving it,
but I didn't know.

284
00:11:29,791 --> 00:11:32,708
I'm not sure, but I think
I might be getting kinda scared.

285
00:11:32,791 --> 00:11:35,625
-What if we never find our way out?
-Already on it, dude.

286
00:11:35,708 --> 00:11:38,083
We decide we're never gonna
find our way out.

287
00:11:38,166 --> 00:11:41,000
Then, there's nothing to be scared of,
'cause we know what's gonna happen:

288
00:11:41,083 --> 00:11:43,208
we're never getting out.
And when we do make it out,

289
00:11:43,291 --> 00:11:45,125
it's a bonus, 'cause we made it out!

290
00:11:45,208 --> 00:11:46,708
Oh, good thinking, Cory.

291
00:11:46,791 --> 00:11:48,458
Okay, I feel a little better now.

292
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:50,416
[echoing voices] <i>Cory! Jacob!</i>

293
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:51,583
Dude!

294
00:11:51,666 --> 00:11:54,708
You hear that? It's them.
They're looking for us, dude.

295
00:11:54,791 --> 00:11:56,833
Hey! We're over here, dudes!

296
00:11:56,916 --> 00:11:57,833
We're here!

297
00:11:57,916 --> 00:12:00,583
-Come on, let's go.
-I think they're down this way.

298
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,333
No, I think it's coming
from over here, Cory.

299
00:12:03,416 --> 00:12:05,083
I don't think so, man. Listen.

300
00:12:05,166 --> 00:12:06,000
Dude.

301
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:07,958
Dude, that's just the echo, man.

302
00:12:08,041 --> 00:12:10,333
It is, but I learned about echoes
in science, dude.

303
00:12:10,416 --> 00:12:12,541
Listen, echoes are made by sound,

304
00:12:12,625 --> 00:12:14,416
and the sound's coming
out their mouths, right?

305
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,208
Uh-huh, I'd say so.

306
00:12:16,291 --> 00:12:18,875
-And where would their mouths be?
-On their faces.

307
00:12:18,958 --> 00:12:21,541
And their faces have to be
where the rest of them is!

308
00:12:21,625 --> 00:12:22,791
Exactly, dude! Science!

309
00:12:23,208 --> 00:12:24,500
[sighs] Good job, Cory.

310
00:12:25,208 --> 00:12:26,666
-So, which way?
-This way.

311
00:12:27,625 --> 00:12:29,583
Cory! Jacob!

312
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:32,166
If you're not here in ten seconds,
we'll assume you got eaten!

313
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:34,375
Holy fuck, boys, check it out.

314
00:12:34,458 --> 00:12:36,833
We wandered right up to the tunnel. Wow!

315
00:12:36,916 --> 00:12:39,375
Oh, we just wandered right to it, did we?

316
00:12:39,458 --> 00:12:43,083
You're fucking unbelievable.
We need to find these guys. I'm serious.

317
00:12:43,166 --> 00:12:44,750
Bubs, we tried our best, okay?

318
00:12:44,833 --> 00:12:47,708
They probably found their way out,
and they're back at the park.

319
00:12:47,791 --> 00:12:49,416
-Yeah, or they got eaten.
-Yeah.

320
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,083
Maybe either of those is true.

321
00:12:51,166 --> 00:12:52,916
Or you know what else could be happening?

322
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,250
Maybe they're dehydrated and hungry,
wandering around trying to decide

323
00:12:56,333 --> 00:12:58,541
who's gonna eat
the other person's leg first.

324
00:12:58,625 --> 00:13:00,916
[sighs] Come on, boys,
let's just backtrack.

325
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,250
Fine, Bubs. You're in charge.

326
00:13:02,333 --> 00:13:04,291
If you want your best friend
back in jail, then…

327
00:13:04,375 --> 00:13:05,666
Whoa, I'm not going back to jail.

328
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:08,541
You probably will now,
because you're gonna rob a gas station

329
00:13:08,625 --> 00:13:10,583
trying to get money
for fucking smokes, man.

330
00:13:10,666 --> 00:13:12,791
But you know,
it's Bubs' fucking call here.

331
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:14,125
-No big deal.
-You know what?

332
00:13:14,208 --> 00:13:16,625
Stick your reverse psychology
right in your arse!

333
00:13:16,708 --> 00:13:18,916
Go the fuck ahead, boys.
I don't give a fuck.

334
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,625
Okay? I'll wait right here,
and I'll keep yelling for the boys,

335
00:13:21,708 --> 00:13:24,458
just in case they're about to fucking die,
because I care.

336
00:13:24,541 --> 00:13:26,083
You sure, buddy? That's perfect.

337
00:13:26,166 --> 00:13:27,916
-Thanks.
-[Julian] Yeah, let's do this.

338
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,458
You two might want to check
your sarcasm detectors.

339
00:13:30,541 --> 00:13:31,625
They need new batteries.

340
00:13:31,708 --> 00:13:33,791
[Ricky laughs] So does
your mom's pussy machine!

341
00:13:33,875 --> 00:13:36,041
Okay. If this map is right,

342
00:13:36,125 --> 00:13:38,500
we just gotta bust through this floor,
and we're in.

343
00:13:38,583 --> 00:13:40,958
Come on, pound it
like it's your fucking cock on payday!

344
00:13:41,041 --> 00:13:41,875
Pound that shit!

345
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,166
-Come on!
-Bust through!

346
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:44,958
-Come on, baby!
-Harder, Julian!

347
00:13:45,041 --> 00:13:45,958
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

348
00:13:46,041 --> 00:13:47,916
-We did it! We're in!
-Yes!

349
00:13:51,166 --> 00:13:53,625
-Holy sweet fuck! Look at this place.
-[celestial music playing]

350
00:13:53,708 --> 00:13:55,541
There's gotta be
a million packs of cigarettes!

351
00:13:55,625 --> 00:13:56,916
Oh, my fuck.

352
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,708
Look how much booze there is, man.

353
00:13:59,291 --> 00:14:00,208
Are you crying?

354
00:14:00,291 --> 00:14:01,541
No, I'm not crying, man.

355
00:14:01,625 --> 00:14:02,458
You're crying.

356
00:14:02,541 --> 00:14:04,000
I got fucking dirt in my eyes.

357
00:14:04,083 --> 00:14:05,750
-Or you're crying.
-I'm not crying.

358
00:14:05,833 --> 00:14:07,625
Holy fuck, Bubs!
You gotta come check this out.

359
00:14:07,708 --> 00:14:09,375
[Ricky echoing] It's fucking insane!

360
00:14:09,833 --> 00:14:11,875
No, thanks. I'm fine right here.

361
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:15,250
-[squeaking]
-[screams] Something licked me!

362
00:14:16,125 --> 00:14:18,791
Hang on, boys, I'm coming. [whimpering]

363
00:14:19,333 --> 00:14:20,875
Thanks for coming, Jeremy.

364
00:14:20,958 --> 00:14:22,625
I had a really nice time.

365
00:14:22,708 --> 00:14:24,625
I really enjoy your company.

366
00:14:24,708 --> 00:14:27,291
I enjoy your company, too, Randy.

367
00:14:27,375 --> 00:14:29,333
Maybe we can do this again sometime.

368
00:14:29,416 --> 00:14:32,041
Oh, I'd like that. How about tomorrow?

369
00:14:32,125 --> 00:14:33,583
Sounds good to me.

370
00:14:33,666 --> 00:14:37,625
Maybe I could just leave
my spatula here, then?

371
00:14:38,416 --> 00:14:40,708
I think that would be just fine.

372
00:14:40,791 --> 00:14:41,625
[kissing]

373
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:44,375
[hissing]

374
00:14:44,458 --> 00:14:46,375
Mr. Lahey! What are you doing here?

375
00:14:46,458 --> 00:14:48,166
Is there something you're not telling me?

376
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:52,291
What? No, I was just having a barbecue
with my friend here.

377
00:14:52,375 --> 00:14:53,541
Fuck off, Randy.

378
00:14:53,625 --> 00:14:54,791
What? Why?

379
00:14:54,875 --> 00:14:58,125
Fuck off, you little shitbag.
How much do you charge for regular booty?

380
00:14:58,208 --> 00:15:01,208
Charge? I didn't charge him.
He's my friend.

381
00:15:01,291 --> 00:15:03,666
I can't imagine
what I ever saw in you, Randy.

382
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:05,458
What the frig is that supposed to mean?

383
00:15:05,541 --> 00:15:08,000
Just a lard-ass is what you are,
Randy, really.

384
00:15:08,083 --> 00:15:10,416
Yeah, well,
you're just a drunk idiot, Mr. Lahey.

385
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:12,291
Fuck off, you little shitbag!

386
00:15:12,375 --> 00:15:13,833
I'm not a drunk idiot, Randy.

387
00:15:13,916 --> 00:15:16,041
Yes, you are. And you're frigging mean.

388
00:15:16,125 --> 00:15:18,000
And I don't need
to frigging listen to this!

389
00:15:20,916 --> 00:15:21,750
[chugging]

390
00:15:22,583 --> 00:15:24,000
Man, I'm so thirsty.

391
00:15:24,083 --> 00:15:25,750
I think I need to lay down, Cory.

392
00:15:25,833 --> 00:15:27,333
That's a bad idea, dude.

393
00:15:27,416 --> 00:15:29,500
You're not supposed to go to sleep
when you're lost.

394
00:15:29,583 --> 00:15:31,250
I think that's
only after you hit your head.

395
00:15:31,333 --> 00:15:32,500
And only for an hour.

396
00:15:32,583 --> 00:15:34,083
No, that's jogging, dude.

397
00:15:34,166 --> 00:15:37,416
No, man. I give up, Cory.
I think we're going around in circles.

398
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:38,625
Oh, I got it, dude!

399
00:15:38,708 --> 00:15:40,166
There's this movie, <i>The Fugitive,</i>

400
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:42,791
or <i>Daylight </i>with Stallone.
Maybe it was <i>Flushed Away </i>with the rat.

401
00:15:42,875 --> 00:15:45,666
-You remember, he was dope, the rat.
-Yeah, he was awesome.

402
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:46,750
What about him, though?

403
00:15:46,833 --> 00:15:49,666
Huh? Oh, yeah.
Okay, well, whatever movie it was,

404
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:52,958
they were lost in the tunnel,
and they poured out a little bit of water,

405
00:15:53,041 --> 00:15:55,250
and they watched which way it went,
and bam!

406
00:15:55,333 --> 00:15:56,458
It told them what way to go.

407
00:15:56,541 --> 00:15:59,375
The rat was saved, the fugitive was saved,
Stallone was saved.

408
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:02,916
-It doesn't even matter. They were saved.
-Man, that's brilliant, Cory.

409
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,833
-We don't have any water.
-[Cory grunts]

410
00:16:04,916 --> 00:16:06,416
We could piss, dude!

411
00:16:08,625 --> 00:16:11,666
-[both straining]
-Oh, man, I got nothing in the tank.

412
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:13,000
Neither do I.

413
00:16:13,083 --> 00:16:15,000
I'm kidney-shy, dude.
But we were so close.

414
00:16:15,083 --> 00:16:16,666
Oh, man, maybe that has water in it.

415
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:18,375
-The valve.
-Of course, dude.

416
00:16:18,458 --> 00:16:21,500
That's what valves are, the water buttons.
[grunts]

417
00:16:21,583 --> 00:16:24,208
[Cory] If we just open it a tiny bit,

418
00:16:24,291 --> 00:16:26,291
we should be able to let a little…

419
00:16:26,375 --> 00:16:27,333
drop of…

420
00:16:27,416 --> 00:16:29,291
-Oh, shit, dude!
-[spraying]

421
00:16:29,375 --> 00:16:31,541
It's got me! And it smells really bad!

422
00:16:31,625 --> 00:16:33,000
I can't swim!

423
00:16:33,083 --> 00:16:34,125
Neither can I!

424
00:16:34,208 --> 00:16:36,458
This is enough cigarettes
for at least five years.

425
00:16:36,541 --> 00:16:37,583
Maybe five and a half!

426
00:16:37,666 --> 00:16:39,666
Yeah, and at least a month
of booze here, too.

427
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:40,666
-A month?
-What?

428
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:43,833
Yeah, if I don't go too crazy,
yeah, it'll be a month's worth.

429
00:16:43,916 --> 00:16:45,125
Not what I meant.

430
00:16:45,208 --> 00:16:47,333
-Can we just get out of here, please?
-[water gurgling]

431
00:16:47,416 --> 00:16:50,375
Holy fuck, boys, we're trapped!
It's filling up with water!

432
00:16:50,458 --> 00:16:51,416
Fuck.

433
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:52,791
Correction.

434
00:16:52,875 --> 00:16:54,583
It's filling up with sewer water.

435
00:16:54,666 --> 00:16:56,208
Goddamn, that's piss and shit?

436
00:16:56,291 --> 00:16:58,333
That's what sewer water is. Yes, Ricky.

437
00:16:58,416 --> 00:16:59,958
For fuck's sakes!

438
00:17:00,041 --> 00:17:02,166
It's not a problem.
We just walk out the front door.

439
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:04,916
No, if we walk out the door,
we're gonna trip the fucking alarms.

440
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,583
Who gives a fuck? When the cops get here

441
00:17:06,666 --> 00:17:07,958
-we'll be long gone.
-[sirens]

442
00:17:08,041 --> 00:17:10,291
-Oh, my fuck! The cops are here now!
-Shit!

443
00:17:10,375 --> 00:17:12,583
Actually, look. I mean, it's not that bad.

444
00:17:12,666 --> 00:17:15,458
Ricky, it's literally a river of shit!

445
00:17:15,541 --> 00:17:17,833
No, I know. But we gotta do it.
Who wants to go first?

446
00:17:17,916 --> 00:17:20,375
Jesus Christ, get me the fuck out of here.
Move out of my way!

447
00:17:20,458 --> 00:17:21,791
-Yes, Julian!
-[Bubbles whimpering]

448
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:24,083
-Fuck, it's disgusting!
-[Bubbles screams]

449
00:17:24,166 --> 00:17:26,916
-[dramatic music playing]
-We're in a very shit-dense liquid here,

450
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,666
so the shit density
should make us pretty buoyant.

451
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:32,916
Try to keep your toes pointed,
like Indiana Jones would do!

452
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,208
[Ricky] Fuck!
Look at the fucking light up there!

453
00:17:35,291 --> 00:17:36,125
We got dead.

454
00:17:36,208 --> 00:17:38,083
What the fuck are you talking about?

455
00:17:38,166 --> 00:17:39,583
We're not dead, Ricky! Just…

456
00:17:39,666 --> 00:17:41,333
hold on to your nuts, boys.

457
00:17:41,416 --> 00:17:43,500
I think we're going
into the Halifax Harbor!

458
00:17:43,583 --> 00:17:44,500
[all screaming]

459
00:17:44,583 --> 00:17:48,875
[gasping, coughing]

460
00:17:48,958 --> 00:17:51,125
God! The fucking sewer
gets pumped into the harbor?

461
00:17:51,208 --> 00:17:52,041
I didn't know that.

462
00:17:52,125 --> 00:17:53,250
It has for years, Ricky.

463
00:17:53,333 --> 00:17:56,041
Why do you think the main fish in here
is called finless brown?

464
00:17:56,125 --> 00:17:57,250
Help!

465
00:17:57,333 --> 00:17:58,375
I can't swim!

466
00:17:58,458 --> 00:18:00,125
Hold onto me, Jacob!

467
00:18:00,208 --> 00:18:01,250
Don't let go!

468
00:18:01,333 --> 00:18:04,041
I told you
they were too fucking dumb to die!

469
00:18:04,125 --> 00:18:07,125
Come on, we gotta save them!
Dump the cigarettes and liquor!

470
00:18:07,208 --> 00:18:08,375
Are you fucking crazy?

471
00:18:08,458 --> 00:18:10,083
Yeah, not happening, bud!

472
00:18:10,166 --> 00:18:11,958
Just stay there and give me a boost.

473
00:18:12,041 --> 00:18:14,208
[Jacob] I'm trying,
but… I need my mouth to breathe!

474
00:18:14,291 --> 00:18:16,166
Don't move your head. I can use it!

475
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:18,166
If I just push myself up, like this!

476
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:20,125
[Bubbles]  You're gonna drown each other!

477
00:18:20,208 --> 00:18:23,000
-[splashing]
-Jesus. Jesus Christ, Cory.

478
00:18:23,083 --> 00:18:26,166
-[Julian] Cory, stop panicking!
-Trying to-- kill me!

479
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:27,375
Ricky!

480
00:18:27,458 --> 00:18:28,666
Julian!

481
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:30,666
-[Ricky] Fuck off, Jacob!
-[struggling]

482
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:32,125
[all grunting]

483
00:18:32,208 --> 00:18:34,458
-[Ricky] Jesus!
-Fucking drown me!

484
00:18:34,541 --> 00:18:35,416
Jesus Christ!

485
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:36,833
[bottles clinking]

486
00:18:36,916 --> 00:18:40,291
-Quit pulling me under, fucking idiots!
-[splashing]

487
00:18:40,375 --> 00:18:42,041
-[Ricky] Fuck off!
-[Bubbles] Fuck off!

488
00:18:42,125 --> 00:18:44,375
[Ricky] What the fuck
are we gonna do here, Julian?

489
00:18:44,458 --> 00:18:45,291
Fuck!

490
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:47,958
-[Bubbles] You can't use each other…
-Dump it! We have no choice.

491
00:18:48,041 --> 00:18:50,875
-[Ricky] Jesus fucking Christ!
-[splashes]

492
00:18:50,958 --> 00:18:55,625
[screaming] No! Beautiful cigarettes!

493
00:18:56,208 --> 00:18:59,083
[water sloshing]

494
00:18:59,166 --> 00:19:00,625
Holy fuck, we made it.

495
00:19:00,708 --> 00:19:01,625
Everybody's alive.

496
00:19:01,708 --> 00:19:02,708
[Jacob coughing]

497
00:19:02,791 --> 00:19:04,208
[panting] Goddammit!

498
00:19:04,291 --> 00:19:05,541
All that fucking booze.

499
00:19:05,875 --> 00:19:06,708
Gone.

500
00:19:06,875 --> 00:19:08,166
[coughing]

501
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:10,000
And the fucking cigarettes!

502
00:19:10,083 --> 00:19:12,250
-You fucking little dick pinchers!
-Ricky!

503
00:19:12,333 --> 00:19:14,291
You two owe me
five years' worth of cigarettes!

504
00:19:14,375 --> 00:19:16,708
-I'm gonna fucking kill you!
-Ricky!

505
00:19:16,791 --> 00:19:18,625
-Ricky, calm down!
-Fuck!

506
00:19:18,708 --> 00:19:20,208
-Shit, dude.
-Sorry, Ricky.

507
00:19:20,875 --> 00:19:23,833
Mr. Lahey, I wanna frigging talk to you
right now!

508
00:19:23,916 --> 00:19:25,791
-Where the frig are you?
-[hissing]

509
00:19:25,875 --> 00:19:28,041
-How you doing, bud?
-There you frigging are.

510
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:30,583
-We gotta talk.
-Why don't we get to it, Randy?

511
00:19:30,666 --> 00:19:33,458
I think you were being
really frigging mean earlier

512
00:19:33,541 --> 00:19:35,916
when you got mad at me
for doing stuff with Jeremy.

513
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,333
I miss you like crazy, Mr. Lahey, but…

514
00:19:38,416 --> 00:19:41,250
-I have needs.
-You'd like to bang him, wouldn't you?

515
00:19:41,333 --> 00:19:43,666
Well, of course I would. But I haven't.

516
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:45,958
I don't even know why,
but for some reason,

517
00:19:46,041 --> 00:19:49,291
I'm still loyal to you.
I didn't even go all the way with Jeremy.

518
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:52,333
All we did was oral, and that's not even
cheating, if you ask me.

519
00:19:53,208 --> 00:19:54,791
You look pretty today, Randy.

520
00:19:54,875 --> 00:19:58,208
Why are you being so nice to me now,
when you were being so mean earlier?

521
00:19:58,291 --> 00:20:00,416
I was trying to drink myself sober, bud.

522
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:02,958
Well, that really hurt me, Mr. Lahey.

523
00:20:03,041 --> 00:20:04,833
If you're gonna be popping in on me
like this,

524
00:20:04,916 --> 00:20:05,833
you have to promise me

525
00:20:05,916 --> 00:20:08,291
you're not gonna yell at me
or be frigging mean to me anymore.

526
00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:11,041
Pinky swear. Say, "I love you, Mr. Lahey."

527
00:20:11,125 --> 00:20:13,791
-I love you, Mr. Lahey.
-No, not like that. Say it like:

528
00:20:13,875 --> 00:20:17,041
-[huskily] "I love you, Mr. Lahey."
-[tenderly] I love you, Mr. Lahey.

529
00:20:17,583 --> 00:20:20,041
Thank you, sir. I feel a lot better now.

530
00:20:20,833 --> 00:20:22,250
[gentle music playing]

531
00:20:23,833 --> 00:20:26,333
Holy fuck,
where did you get all the cigarettes?

532
00:20:26,416 --> 00:20:27,750
Took a drive back down the harbor,

533
00:20:27,833 --> 00:20:29,666
and there was a few cartons
washed up onshore.

534
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:32,208
It's not five years' worth,
but better than nothing, I guess.

535
00:20:32,291 --> 00:20:35,666
Found a couple bottles of booze, too.
Not much, but it'll get me fucking drunk.

536
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:38,166
Well… the booze should be fine,

537
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:40,541
but you're not gonna smoke the cigarettes,
are you, Ricky?

538
00:20:40,625 --> 00:20:42,208
I am. Why the fuck wouldn't I?

539
00:20:42,291 --> 00:20:43,666
Well, they're no good now.

540
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:46,041
They were floating
in dirty old shit and piss water.

541
00:20:46,458 --> 00:20:49,375
Yeah, but I figured they were already wet,
so I washed them with hose water

542
00:20:49,458 --> 00:20:50,541
and cleaned them right up.

543
00:20:50,625 --> 00:20:52,333
They're probably healthier now.

544
00:20:52,708 --> 00:20:54,541
So, you think
'cause you washed the cigarettes

545
00:20:54,625 --> 00:20:57,250
with old fuckin' hose water,
they're clean and healthy now?

546
00:20:57,625 --> 00:21:00,458
Well, yeah, Bubs.
That's what water does. It washes shit.

547
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:03,166
See? Look at that. Clean and healthy.

548
00:21:03,541 --> 00:21:04,458
Oh, my God.

549
00:21:04,541 --> 00:21:05,708
[puffing]

550
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,250
[coughing]

551
00:21:09,333 --> 00:21:10,166
[Bubbles] Yep.

552
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:11,541
[hacking cough]

553
00:21:11,625 --> 00:21:14,458
Oh, fuck! Jesus Christ! [coughs]

554
00:21:15,208 --> 00:21:16,416
Yeah, how are they, Ricky?

555
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:18,375
-Pretty clean and healthy, eh?
-Oh, no, man.

556
00:21:18,458 --> 00:21:20,666
They taste like shit, actually.
Like, literemally.

557
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:21,750
Fucking Cory and Jacob!

558
00:21:21,833 --> 00:21:24,291
I'm gonna kill those beanpole,
alien fuck rockets!

559
00:21:24,375 --> 00:21:28,333
Ricky, remember earlier when you told me
you just wanted to be a better person?

560
00:21:28,416 --> 00:21:30,041
Yeah, but I was lying about that,
remember?

561
00:21:30,125 --> 00:21:32,291
I know you were lying about it, but…

562
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,291
did you ever think about
actually trying it?

563
00:21:35,375 --> 00:21:38,041
-[Trinity] Dad…
-Look, Trin, I know what you're gonna say,

564
00:21:38,125 --> 00:21:40,583
-but you're not--
-Dad, I just wanted to say thank you

565
00:21:40,666 --> 00:21:42,125
for hanging out with Jacob.

566
00:21:42,208 --> 00:21:45,250
They're both in there talking about
what an amazing day they had.

567
00:21:45,333 --> 00:21:46,458
Oh, they are?

568
00:21:46,541 --> 00:21:49,833
Of course they are, Ricky.
Those guys idolize you.

569
00:21:49,916 --> 00:21:51,791
Thanks again, Dad! You're the best.

570
00:21:51,875 --> 00:21:53,750
No problem, sweetie. Love you.

571
00:21:53,833 --> 00:21:56,541
Man, maybe I could be a better person.

[piano music playing]

573
00:21:58,666 --> 00:22:00,791
Here, man. I got these for you as a gift.

574
00:22:00,875 --> 00:22:01,708
No way.

575
00:22:01,791 --> 00:22:03,875
Wow, man. I don't know what to say.

576
00:22:03,958 --> 00:22:06,708
Yeah, I'm trying to be a better person
for real this time.

577
00:22:06,791 --> 00:22:09,500
Well, you're a good fucking guy, Ricky.
Thanks, buddy.

578
00:22:09,583 --> 00:22:10,416
How'd it taste? Okay?

579
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:13,833
I washed the piss and shit off,
but I wasn't sure if I got all of it.

580
00:22:15,041 --> 00:22:17,250
Yes, Ricky. No, it's fine, man.
It's perfect.

581
00:22:17,583 --> 00:22:18,416
Thanks, bud.

582
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:20,291
-[Ricky] Love you, bud.
-Love you too, man.

583
00:22:20,375 --> 00:22:24,375

[voices] Oh, fuck.

588
00:23:44,916 --> 00:23:45,833
[man] Jesus Christ!

-[crowd murmuring]
-[carnival music playing]

2
00:00:12,625 --> 00:00:14,750
Right on, brother.
Good to see you again.

3
00:00:14,833 --> 00:00:15,916
You too, Ricky.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,958
My fuck, look at those sloppy, beautiful,
chili-covered whores.

5
00:00:20,041 --> 00:00:22,750
I know the kitchens at these fairs
are disgusting.

6
00:00:22,833 --> 00:00:26,958
They only change the oil in the fryers
once a year, but don't give a fuck.

7
00:00:27,041 --> 00:00:29,541
[laughs] That's
what makes everything scrump-dilly.

8
00:00:29,625 --> 00:00:32,500
I just hope the food and the fair
will cheer Julian up.

9
00:00:32,583 --> 00:00:34,000
He's had the saddies lately.

10
00:00:34,458 --> 00:00:35,333
[munching]

11
00:00:36,208 --> 00:00:39,250
Oh, my fuck,
you are one tasty little bastard!

12
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:43,250
Bubbles fucking loves coming to the fair.
I think we're getting old for it,

13
00:00:43,333 --> 00:00:45,958
but Bubbles wants to cheer Julian up.
He's been acting weird lately.

14
00:00:46,041 --> 00:00:48,000
Lucky for us, I know guys
that work here from jail,

15
00:00:48,083 --> 00:00:49,583
so I trade dope for food and rides.

16
00:00:50,541 --> 00:00:53,833
For fuck's sakes! Nice fuck up,
brain. You fucking idiot. [punching]

17
00:00:54,958 --> 00:00:58,500
Holy fuck! Check that shit out, boys.
Just like Gene Simmons from Kiss.

18
00:00:58,583 --> 00:01:00,083
It's not that great. I can do better.

19
00:01:00,166 --> 00:01:02,375
Remember how good I was that Halloween
I went as a dragon?

20
00:01:02,458 --> 00:01:05,541
I remember the year you melted
the fucking costume to your face.

21
00:01:05,625 --> 00:01:08,875
Or do you mean the year you burnt
your larynx so bad, you shit yourself?

22
00:01:08,958 --> 00:01:10,416
Let's just get the fuck out of here.

23
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:12,875
Ba-fucking-bum-hug.
Snap the fuck out of it.

24
00:01:12,958 --> 00:01:15,583
Let's smoke a joint
and hit the fucking Tilty-world.

25
00:01:15,666 --> 00:01:19,833
Yeah, c'mon. Let's get right out of here
and go zipping around in circles.

26
00:01:19,916 --> 00:01:22,083
That'll put a smile on your face,
guaranteed.

27
00:01:22,166 --> 00:01:24,208
-[children screaming]
-Here we go, boys.

28
00:01:24,291 --> 00:01:25,916
Lean into 'er! G-force!

29
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Yeah!

30
00:01:27,083 --> 00:01:31,250
Fuck, I love being high
on the Tilty-world!

31
00:01:31,333 --> 00:01:33,666
I appreciate what the boys are doing,
but I don't know

32
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:36,416
what the fuck's wrong with me.
Maybe it's because I'm getting older,

33
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:38,375
or I don't have anything
and probably never will,

34
00:01:38,458 --> 00:01:42,583
but spinning on a fucking Tilt-a-Whirl
with two high-as-fuck, screaming lunatics

35
00:01:42,666 --> 00:01:44,333
isn't gonna make me feel any better.

36
00:01:44,416 --> 00:01:47,750
[belches] Holy fuck, boys.
Those chili dogs tasted just as good

37
00:01:47,833 --> 00:01:49,541
the second time they went down.
[laughs]

38
00:01:49,625 --> 00:01:51,958
That is the greatest ride
ever invention-ed.

39
00:01:52,041 --> 00:01:53,375
Hey, Julian, check it out.

40
00:01:53,958 --> 00:01:56,500
Maybe they can give you some good news
and cheer you up.

41
00:01:56,583 --> 00:01:58,166
No fucking way. We're not going in there.

42
00:01:58,250 --> 00:02:01,250
-It's a bunch of fucking con artists.
-Actually, that might not be a bad idea.

43
00:02:01,333 --> 00:02:04,708
-Maybe they can give me some good news.
-Are you fucking serious right now?

44
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:07,375
How many times are you gonna let
those charlatans fuck up your head

45
00:02:07,458 --> 00:02:09,500
-with bullshit?
-The one thing I wanna do,

46
00:02:09,583 --> 00:02:11,541
and nobody gives a fuck.
Let's go home, then.

47
00:02:11,625 --> 00:02:14,791
"Oh, let's just go home, then."
You're just a big, muscular baby.

48
00:02:14,875 --> 00:02:16,125
[mysterious music playing]

49
00:02:16,208 --> 00:02:17,541
I see something.

50
00:02:17,958 --> 00:02:19,625
Yes.

51
00:02:19,708 --> 00:02:22,916
Someone in your family…

52
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:23,916
they had…

53
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,500
Oh, it was a major injury.

54
00:02:26,583 --> 00:02:29,708
And it caused them great anguish in life.

55
00:02:29,791 --> 00:02:31,791
Holy fuck, it's my dad.
He was in a big rig accident.

56
00:02:31,875 --> 00:02:33,833
Ended up in a wheelchair.
Had to live at the dump.

57
00:02:33,916 --> 00:02:37,291
Ray wasn't actually injured,
and he wanted to live at the dump.

58
00:02:37,375 --> 00:02:39,083
She's just using vague shit

59
00:02:39,166 --> 00:02:42,250
that could apply to any situation.
She's letting you fill in the blanks.

60
00:02:42,333 --> 00:02:44,750
-This is how they operate--
-Bubs, chill, man.

61
00:02:44,833 --> 00:02:48,083
I am being overwhelmed all of a sudden.

62
00:02:48,166 --> 00:02:49,000
Oh, yeah.

63
00:02:49,083 --> 00:02:53,291
Oh, I sense very powerful things
with this young man.

64
00:02:53,375 --> 00:02:56,125
Oh, I bet you do.
I got some serious power brewing

65
00:02:56,208 --> 00:02:58,791
-up here from those chili dogs I ate.
-[psychic] No.

66
00:02:58,875 --> 00:03:02,916
I sense abandonment
and… cats.

67
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,375
Oh, wow, you know I have cats!

68
00:03:05,458 --> 00:03:08,416
I'm fucking covered in cat hair, lady!
Nice try.

69
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:11,125
I sense you were abandoned…

70
00:03:11,541 --> 00:03:12,708
by your family,

71
00:03:12,791 --> 00:03:15,458
and you found comfort…

72
00:03:15,541 --> 00:03:18,291
uh, in a very special cat.

73
00:03:18,375 --> 00:03:21,958
Uh, I've had lots of very special cats
over the years.

74
00:03:22,041 --> 00:03:24,416
-They're all very special. That's just--
-Not like this one.

75
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:27,166
He was born with a paw,

76
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:29,333
it looked like a lobster claw.

77
00:03:29,416 --> 00:03:31,583
Wait, now. I did have a kitty like that.

78
00:03:31,666 --> 00:03:33,791
<i>-</i>His name--
-His name was Vincent,

79
00:03:33,875 --> 00:03:35,666

Vince the Pince?

81
00:03:37,166 --> 00:03:39,666
Okay! Just hang the fuck on here.

82
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:40,875
How did you know that?

83
00:03:40,958 --> 00:03:42,750
[whimpering]
I'm calling bullshit.

84
00:03:42,833 --> 00:03:44,666
I don't know how the fuck you did that,

85
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:48,250
but there has to be a logical explanation,
'cause this shit's not real.

86
00:03:48,333 --> 00:03:50,458
Everybody knows it!

Thanks, Rick.

90
00:03:59,333 --> 00:04:01,208
I have to turn to the cards.

91
00:04:04,375 --> 00:04:07,333
-What's going on? What is it?
-[gasps] I'm afraid...

92
00:04:07,416 --> 00:04:11,125
I just can't tell you.
It goes way too deep.

93
00:04:11,208 --> 00:04:13,625
It's taken all of my energy.

94
00:04:13,708 --> 00:04:16,625
Perhaps if I had some more weed,

95
00:04:16,708 --> 00:04:19,583
I could focus my thoughts
and reach the beyond.

96
00:04:19,666 --> 00:04:20,833
Oh, yeah, here we go.

97
00:04:20,916 --> 00:04:23,625
It's the ole "hand over more money" con,
right on cue.

98
00:04:23,708 --> 00:04:26,250
-See? I knew it.
-Bubs, would you shut up?

99
00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:27,416
-Ricky…
-[Bubbles] Charlatan.

100
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:30,500
-[Ricky grumbles]
-Don't worry, I'll get you back, man.

101
00:04:30,583 --> 00:04:33,541
Pick a card. Pick another one!

102
00:04:34,166 --> 00:04:36,583
-What did that card mean?
-If I were you,

103
00:04:36,666 --> 00:04:40,000
I would do everything
you ever wanted to do in your life

104
00:04:40,083 --> 00:04:41,791
-in the next week.
<i>-</i>Why?

105
00:04:42,625 --> 00:04:44,250
{\an8}Because you're fucked.

107
00:04:52,958 --> 00:04:56,416
Ricky! Bubbles! Get the fuck out here!
Let's go, boys. Move it.

108
00:04:57,333 --> 00:04:58,500
Hey, Julian, what's up?

109
00:04:58,583 --> 00:05:00,458
I mean, other than Ricky's boner.

110
00:05:00,541 --> 00:05:02,500
Most of this is a piss boner. Fuck off.

111
00:05:02,583 --> 00:05:05,625
-Pack clothes. We're going on a road trip.
-What do you mean, a road trip?

112
00:05:05,708 --> 00:05:08,250
Don't tell me this is something to do
with that fucking psychic.

113
00:05:08,333 --> 00:05:11,000
How the fuck did she know
about Vince the Pince, huh?

114
00:05:11,083 --> 00:05:14,541
Well, I don't know exactly,
but I do know she's not magic.

115
00:05:14,625 --> 00:05:16,500
There's no way
she can see into the future.

116
00:05:16,583 --> 00:05:18,875
And how can you be sure?
What if I <i>am</i> dying?

117
00:05:18,958 --> 00:05:21,166
Because if I am,
I'm gonna do something right now

118
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:22,333
that's gonna make me happy.

119
00:05:22,416 --> 00:05:25,041
-And what the fuck's gonna make you happy?
-You remember Julianne?

120
00:05:26,125 --> 00:05:29,458
I met Julianne back in grade 11,
and she was a girl that, you know…

121
00:05:29,541 --> 00:05:30,916
I thought that she was the one.

122
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,791
But unfortunately, I was going to jail,
and I had to break up with her,

123
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:36,583
because I didn't want her
to think that I was a loser or anything.

124
00:05:36,666 --> 00:05:40,083
I still think about her, and I feel guilty
about the way shit ended between us.

125
00:05:40,166 --> 00:05:41,000
It sucks.

126
00:05:41,083 --> 00:05:43,916
I found her on Facebook.
She's living in PEI, and she's single.

127
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,750
We've been texting
all fucking morning.

128
00:05:45,833 --> 00:05:47,708
Okay, but why do we need to go with you?

129
00:05:47,791 --> 00:05:50,708
You know what? Stay here, okay?
That's cool. Just give me a hug,

130
00:05:50,791 --> 00:05:53,333
because this could be the last time
you guys could see me. Ever.

131
00:05:53,416 --> 00:05:57,333
Whatever. I'm still calling bullshit
on that crinkly, old flimflammer.

132
00:05:57,750 --> 00:06:01,375
Okay, but what if there's even
a tiny fraction of a chance she's right?

133
00:06:01,458 --> 00:06:03,000
Is this the way
you wanna say goodbye?

134
00:06:03,583 --> 00:06:05,083
Fine, boys. See you later.

135
00:06:05,166 --> 00:06:07,541
Jesus Christ. Okay, I'll go with you,

136
00:06:07,625 --> 00:06:09,875
but I'm only going
'cause it could be a fun road trip,

137
00:06:09,958 --> 00:06:11,875
not 'cause I think
you're gonna fucking die.

138
00:06:11,958 --> 00:06:14,083
Yeah, me too. Fuck it!
Let's do a road trip.

139
00:06:14,166 --> 00:06:16,583
I'll go grab some pepperoni, some dope,
and some underwear.

140
00:06:18,583 --> 00:06:19,416
If you're gonna die,

141
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:21,458
what else is on your fuck-it list?
Any crazy shit?

142
00:06:21,541 --> 00:06:23,125
Ricky, he's not dying.

143
00:06:23,208 --> 00:06:26,083
Let's deal with Julianne first.
I'm hoping things go well.

144
00:06:26,166 --> 00:06:28,333
You know what? We never got to bang.
You guys know that?

145
00:06:28,416 --> 00:06:30,666
Bull fucking shit.
I thought you said you went down on her.

146
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:32,916
I did, but that's not fucking banging,
though, is it?

147
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,916
She wanted to take things slow, man,
which was really fucking cool.

148
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,833
So, you got cock-blocked by jail.

149
00:06:37,916 --> 00:06:38,750
Big-time.

150
00:06:39,333 --> 00:06:41,916
Holy fuck,
we're almost at the Confederation Bridge.

151
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,416
Man, the fucking history.

152
00:06:43,875 --> 00:06:46,375
All those poor Confederate soldiers
crossed here,

153
00:06:46,458 --> 00:06:49,416
-before a lot of them got dead.
-Oh, yeah, Ricky, a lot of people died

154
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:52,875
during those Civil War battles
between New Brunswick and PEI.

155
00:06:52,958 --> 00:06:56,208
Those fucking poor bastards.
When we get to the middle, pull over.

156
00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:59,125
Gotta do something for the old man.
Carry on one of his family traditions.

157
00:06:59,208 --> 00:07:00,916
Gotta cross something off my fuck-it list.

158
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,583
-[car braking]
-[seagulls cawing]

159
00:07:04,666 --> 00:07:06,083
Anytime we ever crossed a bridge,

160
00:07:06,166 --> 00:07:09,750
he'd stop the car in the middle, get out,
chug a beer, and piss off the bridge,

161
00:07:09,833 --> 00:07:12,458
You're not pissing off
the Confederation Bridge.

162
00:07:12,541 --> 00:07:14,208
There's too many cars passing by.

163
00:07:14,291 --> 00:07:16,625
Who gives a fuck?
Come on, boys, let's do this.

164
00:07:16,708 --> 00:07:20,291
I'm not risking my life
for one of Ray's drunk piss traditions.

165
00:07:20,375 --> 00:07:21,625
Yeah, fuck that.

166
00:07:21,708 --> 00:07:23,208
Pussies! Your loss.

167
00:07:23,916 --> 00:07:25,833
Love you, Dad. This is for you, man!

168
00:07:25,916 --> 00:07:26,750
[chugs]

169
00:07:28,708 --> 00:07:30,375
-[splashing]
-[seagull screeching]

170
00:07:30,458 --> 00:07:31,916
[Ricky screaming]

171
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,333
What the fuck?

172
00:07:33,416 --> 00:07:35,000
Fuck off, you flying shit rat!

173
00:07:35,083 --> 00:07:35,916
Boys, help me!

174
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,416
Seagull's got my cock!

175
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:40,500
Oh, my God! He thinks someone
threw him a shoestring french fry!

176
00:07:40,583 --> 00:07:43,666
You stupid, feathery fuck face!
It's not a shoestring french fry,

177
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:45,791
it's my cock! Fuck off!

178
00:07:45,875 --> 00:07:46,916
-[screaming]
-[gunshot]

179
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,875
Bye-bye, cock-eater! Fuck you!

180
00:07:48,958 --> 00:07:50,791
Ricky, no!
You're gonna blow your wiener off!

181
00:07:50,875 --> 00:07:53,125
[Ricky screaming]

182
00:07:53,208 --> 00:07:54,041
-Fuck you!
-[gunshot]

183
00:07:54,125 --> 00:07:55,791
Oh, God, boys. I can't look.

184
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:58,041
Is it still there? Is it hanging off?
What's going on?

185
00:07:58,125 --> 00:08:01,250
It's still there, but it looks like
it got tangled in a Weedwacker.

186
00:08:01,333 --> 00:08:02,416
Fuck, it hurts!

187
00:08:05,333 --> 00:08:09,000
Oh, man, that cock-eating bird
was not part of the fucking tradition.

188
00:08:09,083 --> 00:08:11,416
Well, obviously.
We guessed that part, Ricky.

189
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:14,208
But look what you got now.
You got a little King Tut mummy bird.

190
00:08:14,291 --> 00:08:15,166
Fuck, it hurts.

191
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:17,833
I'm glad it didn't rip the thing off.
I hope it doesn't scar.

192
00:08:17,916 --> 00:08:20,041
The last thing my cock needs
is more scars.

193
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:22,833
I've had a lot of weird sex injuries
over the years.

194
00:08:22,916 --> 00:08:24,958
The worst was that deep fryer
and the donuts.

195
00:08:25,041 --> 00:08:28,416
It felt so fucking good, but, I mean,
it burned my knob up real bad.

196
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:31,000
I felt bad that Tina lost her job.
What is up with Hortons,

197
00:08:31,083 --> 00:08:33,791
-firing her for that shit--
-Nobody wants to hear

198
00:08:33,875 --> 00:08:36,500
about your crispy knob
going in and out of a sex donut.

199
00:08:36,583 --> 00:08:37,541
Remember the blisters?

200
00:08:37,625 --> 00:08:38,500
-I remember…
-Guys!

201
00:08:38,583 --> 00:08:40,333
-…blisters and the skin coming off!
-Marks...

202
00:08:40,416 --> 00:08:41,875
-Would you shut--
-...down the shaft.

203
00:08:41,958 --> 00:08:43,541
Boys, we're here.

204
00:08:45,666 --> 00:08:48,250
Fuck, is she, like, a queen,
or a princess, or some shit?

205
00:08:48,333 --> 00:08:50,666
Okay. Two, eight, five, eight.

206
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:52,000
Right on, boys. We're in.

207
00:08:52,083 --> 00:08:53,125
[gate creaks open]

208
00:08:53,208 --> 00:08:54,583
Holy shit.

209
00:08:54,666 --> 00:08:57,166
Looks like Julianne
did pretty fucking good for herself.

210
00:08:57,250 --> 00:08:58,583
This place is crazy.

211
00:08:58,666 --> 00:09:00,458
Look at the size of those weed plants!

212
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:02,583
Maybe that's how she makes money.
That's fucking cool.

213
00:09:02,666 --> 00:09:04,666
-Right on.
-What the fuck is this place?

214
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:06,416
Feels like we're on <i>Fantasy Island.</i>

215
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:09,083
Hey, maybe Tattoo is gonna pop out here
in a second.

216
00:09:09,166 --> 00:09:11,291
[in Tattoo's voice] "Boss! The plane!"

217
00:09:11,375 --> 00:09:13,458
-[all laughing]
-God, he was fucked.

218
00:09:14,458 --> 00:09:17,041
-What in the fuck is that all about?
-I don't know.

219
00:09:17,125 --> 00:09:19,166
-It looks like some yoga thing.
-Who gives a fuck?

220
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:21,375
I just wanna try some
of that Jurrasstic Park weed.

221
00:09:21,458 --> 00:09:22,666
Look at the size of those buds!

222
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:25,458
My torn-up seagull cock and my lungs
are hard as fuck right now.

223
00:09:26,333 --> 00:09:28,333
[Ricky] Look at the fucking logs.
Those aren't cheap.

224
00:09:28,416 --> 00:09:29,875
[Bubbles] Red cedar.

225
00:09:29,958 --> 00:09:31,750
What in the serious fuck?

226
00:09:31,833 --> 00:09:34,833
That's the most amazing plant growth
I've ever seent.

227
00:09:34,916 --> 00:09:37,708
These paintings are a tiny bit fucked, no?

228
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:40,416
-We have guests, everyone!
-Merciful Jesus.

229
00:09:41,083 --> 00:09:42,083
How you doing?

230
00:09:42,166 --> 00:09:44,208
Hi, I'm Zion.

231
00:09:44,291 --> 00:09:45,166
Welcome.

232
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:47,166
We are the Passionites.

233
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:49,125
-Thank you. The who?
-[woman laughing]

234
00:09:49,708 --> 00:09:51,500
-Julian!
-Julianne, hey!

235
00:09:51,583 --> 00:09:52,916
Wow, look at you.

236
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,708
I can't believe you're here! Oh, my God.

237
00:09:55,791 --> 00:09:57,708
Wait a second. I remember you guys.

238
00:09:57,791 --> 00:09:59,875
You're Ricky, right? And you're Bubbles.

239
00:09:59,958 --> 00:10:03,791
I can't believe you all still hang out.
That's insane! You must be hungry

240
00:10:03,875 --> 00:10:07,083
after the long drive. Come, join us
in our galaxy den for some food.

241
00:10:07,166 --> 00:10:09,458
-Galaxy den?
-You know what? Food would be great,

242
00:10:09,541 --> 00:10:12,000
but so would getting hooked up
with some of this beautiful weed.

243
00:10:12,083 --> 00:10:14,791
I love it.
I see you haven't changed a bit, Ricky.

244
00:10:14,875 --> 00:10:16,583
Yeah, I have. I'm wearing clean underwear.

245
00:10:16,666 --> 00:10:20,500
-[Julianne laughs]
-[Passionites laugh]

246
00:10:20,583 --> 00:10:23,666
[mystical tones playing]

247
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:25,333
They hooked me up with some of that weed,

248
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:28,208
and I have been as high as fuck
for three days now.

249
00:10:28,291 --> 00:10:31,625
Maybe that's why everyone's so happy,
laughing at shit that's not even funny.

250
00:10:31,708 --> 00:10:34,250
The head weed grower here, Kat,
she's blowing my fucking mind.

251
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:37,250
She knows more about growing dope
than I do, and she's fucking beautiful.

252
00:10:37,333 --> 00:10:40,000
She is maybe the coolest
female-type person I ever got met to.

253
00:10:40,083 --> 00:10:42,000
And her dope
is some of the best I've ever smoked.

254
00:10:42,083 --> 00:10:45,000
Even her kisses taste like weed.
Nice little citrus-ly flavor.

255
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,708
I can't think of a better way
to be spending

256
00:10:47,791 --> 00:10:51,125
what might be my last days on earth.
My best friends and this place.

257
00:10:51,208 --> 00:10:52,708
Fuck, it's like heaven here.

258
00:10:52,791 --> 00:10:54,916
I should have tried to find Julianne
years ago.

259
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,916
There you are. You trying to hide?

260
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,166
Of course not, babe.

261
00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:00,250
I was just telling these guys
how happy I am.

262
00:11:00,333 --> 00:11:01,166
Me too.

263
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:02,916
Can we go somewhere
where the cameras can't?

264
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,250
I want some alone time.

265
00:11:04,333 --> 00:11:05,458
We're done here, guys.

266
00:11:06,041 --> 00:11:09,541
I want you so frigging bad.
Let's be together in the field of clover.

267
00:11:09,625 --> 00:11:11,958
Oh, man, that would be amazing. Let's go.

268
00:11:12,041 --> 00:11:15,041
Not yet, silly.
We need to go through a ceremony first.

269
00:11:15,125 --> 00:11:16,625
Then we can finally be as one.

270
00:11:16,708 --> 00:11:17,541
Ceremony?

271
00:11:17,625 --> 00:11:20,375
Oh, don't worry. You'll love it.
It'll open your heart.

272
00:11:20,666 --> 00:11:22,375
[moaning]

273
00:11:22,458 --> 00:11:24,083
Guys, I'm serious. Turn it off!

274
00:11:25,083 --> 00:11:26,916
This place is fucked!

275
00:11:27,375 --> 00:11:29,541
I mean, I do love the fact
they're off the grid,

276
00:11:29,625 --> 00:11:30,916
and they have organic food, and…

277
00:11:31,375 --> 00:11:35,083
there's even this girl, Tracy,
 that's flirty, and she's decent, but…

278
00:11:35,166 --> 00:11:37,333
something's up with these people,
I'm telling you.

279
00:11:37,416 --> 00:11:41,291
Talking about higher planets,
and weird fucking artwork everywhere.

280
00:11:41,375 --> 00:11:44,458
My Spidey senses are tingling.
Something fucky's going on here.

281
00:11:44,541 --> 00:11:46,166
Look what I found.

282
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:49,958
Tracy says their leader crash-landed here
in this spaceship.

283
00:11:50,041 --> 00:11:52,458
Obviously, total bullshit.
That's no spaceship,

284
00:11:52,541 --> 00:11:55,375
it's the old gift shop
from the Rainbow Valley Kids Park.

285
00:11:55,458 --> 00:11:57,583
I used to go there
when I was a little guy.

286
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,166
Apparently, the leader lives in there,

287
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:02,625
but they won't let us see the cocksucker
or even go in,

288
00:12:02,708 --> 00:12:05,333
because we're not "spiritually ready."

289
00:12:05,416 --> 00:12:08,083
Sounds awfully fucking Jim Jonesey to me.

290
00:12:09,291 --> 00:12:10,166
Hello?

291
00:12:10,666 --> 00:12:13,666
Mr. Petersen here.
Just here to check the pipes.

292
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:14,750
[door creaks open]

293
00:12:15,791 --> 00:12:19,416
What in the name of God's holy nutsack
is your deal, fella?

294
00:12:20,041 --> 00:12:20,875
[neighing]

295
00:12:20,958 --> 00:12:22,541
Oh, my fuck, you're the leader!

296
00:12:22,625 --> 00:12:24,708
Okay, it's official.

297
00:12:24,791 --> 00:12:28,666
These weird Passionite bastards
are a goddamn cult. I knew it!

298
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:32,625
-Boys, we need to talk.
-Hey, man.

299
00:12:32,708 --> 00:12:35,291
Jesus Murphy,
what the fuck are you guys doing?

300
00:12:35,375 --> 00:12:37,250
The girls said to put this on
for the ceremony.

301
00:12:37,333 --> 00:12:39,875
We're gonna meet their leader,
and I guess we're gonna get banged…

302
00:12:39,958 --> 00:12:41,375
Yeah, get your gold on, buddy.

303
00:12:41,458 --> 00:12:43,125
-Heard you got shit going with Tracy.
-Yeah!

304
00:12:43,208 --> 00:12:45,541
No, fuck that.
We need to get out of here.

305
00:12:45,625 --> 00:12:46,458
-What?
-You wanna know

306
00:12:46,541 --> 00:12:49,125
who their mysterious leader is,
who we're not allowed to meet?

307
00:12:49,208 --> 00:12:51,166
He is a fucking horse!

308
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:52,583
-Who's a horse?
-What?

309
00:12:52,666 --> 00:12:55,583
Their leader! He's a horse.
I saw him with my own two eyes.

310
00:12:55,666 --> 00:12:57,250
-What?
-And guess where he lives?

311
00:12:57,333 --> 00:13:00,500
He lives in the spaceship gift shop
from Rainbow Valley.

312
00:13:00,583 --> 00:13:03,333
No way! That's fucking awesome!
I loved that place when I was a kid.

313
00:13:03,416 --> 00:13:06,291
No, I don't think you understand
what I'm saying here.

314
00:13:06,375 --> 00:13:09,458
They worship fucking Seabiscuit.
They sell sanctuary.

315
00:13:09,541 --> 00:13:11,333
-What?
-They're a cult, Ricky!

316
00:13:11,416 --> 00:13:13,833
-No, they're not, man. They're too nice.
-[Ricky] No.

317
00:13:13,916 --> 00:13:15,583
Oh, yeah? So was David Koresh.

318
00:13:15,666 --> 00:13:18,833
He was a hell of a nice guy,
till he started killing people.

319
00:13:18,916 --> 00:13:20,458
We gotta get the fuck out of here.

320
00:13:20,541 --> 00:13:22,083
<i>-</i>Right now!
-Bubs, calm down.

321
00:13:22,166 --> 00:13:24,625
Just let me enjoy
my last days on earth, please?<i> </i>

322
00:13:24,708 --> 00:13:27,208
-You're not even fucking dying!
-Look, just let me do this,

323
00:13:27,291 --> 00:13:28,416
then you guys can leave.

324
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:30,041
Come on, man, this is kind of paradise.

325
00:13:30,125 --> 00:13:33,208
Yeah, said everybody who ever
got brainwashed by a fucking cult.

326
00:13:33,291 --> 00:13:36,083
Oh, my God. No, fuck this!
I'm going to get the car,

327
00:13:36,166 --> 00:13:38,333
-and we are fucking leaving!
-I'm telling you,

328
00:13:38,416 --> 00:13:39,875
these people are harmless.

329
00:13:39,958 --> 00:13:41,291
Yeah, and they smoke dope.

330
00:13:41,375 --> 00:13:44,250
And Kat told me they're into orgies, too.
Like, crazy shit.

331
00:13:44,333 --> 00:13:46,000
Of course they're into dope and orgies!

332
00:13:46,083 --> 00:13:48,958
They're just trying to fucking bait you in
with this shit!

333
00:13:49,041 --> 00:13:51,541
Not trying to beat me into anything.
I'm trying to get sucked off.

334
00:13:51,625 --> 00:13:54,166
Let's go see what it's all about.
It's probably some eat-some-wine,

335
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:55,666
drink-some-bread churchy shit.

336
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:58,041
And then it's fingering, eating, fucking,
and sucking time.

337
00:13:58,125 --> 00:13:59,500
Ricky... Bubs, listen.

338
00:13:59,583 --> 00:14:01,291
Julianne said she loves me, okay?

339
00:14:01,375 --> 00:14:04,208
Can you just, please, go with the flow?
Please? Do this for me?

340
00:14:04,291 --> 00:14:07,250
-You guys are fucked!
-Just do this for me, please!

341
00:14:07,333 --> 00:14:09,000
I'll play along with this, but…

342
00:14:09,083 --> 00:14:12,250
you guys get one round of dirty stuff,
and then we're the fuck out of here!

343
00:14:12,333 --> 00:14:13,375
Come on, two rounds.

344
00:14:13,458 --> 00:14:14,625
One round!

345
00:14:14,708 --> 00:14:15,958
[gong sounds]

346
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,083
Welcome, everyone.

347
00:14:19,166 --> 00:14:22,333
Let's unite our new Passionite brothers
as one with our leader

348
00:14:22,416 --> 00:14:23,916
in this joyous ceremony.

349
00:14:24,583 --> 00:14:28,500
[mysterious music]

350
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:35,000
I fucking told you
their leader was a horse.

351
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:37,166
Who cares?
It's just a fucking horse. Relax.

352
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:39,250
-Yeah, but they're worshiping the--
-Relax!

353
00:14:39,666 --> 00:14:40,541
[horse snorts]

354
00:14:41,208 --> 00:14:42,500
Our leader says he is ready

355
00:14:42,583 --> 00:14:44,500
-to welcome you into our group.
-Nice.

356
00:14:44,583 --> 00:14:46,000
[chanting]

357
00:14:46,416 --> 00:14:48,416
Julian, Ricky, and Bubbles,

358
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:51,375
are you all ready
to start a new beginning with us?

359
00:14:51,458 --> 00:14:53,041
-I fucking am.
-Absolutely.

360
00:14:53,125 --> 00:14:55,666
-Uh, yeah.
-Let us proceed with the baptism.

361
00:14:56,541 --> 00:14:58,666
[chanting continues]

362
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:01,958
Once you are official Passionites,

363
00:15:02,041 --> 00:15:05,916
you'll become part of our energy journey
to the higher planet.

364
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,166
Uh, excuse me, just curious.
What's the yellow liquid?

365
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:12,458
And what's this chunky,
yogurty-looking stuff in the chalices?

366
00:15:12,541 --> 00:15:13,625
First…

367
00:15:13,958 --> 00:15:17,583
they must submerse themselves
in the essence of our leader

368
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:20,791
through his magical, golden secretion.

369
00:15:20,875 --> 00:15:22,333
The golden secretion?

370
00:15:22,416 --> 00:15:26,375
Then, they will swallow his fluid
of renewed life.

371
00:15:26,791 --> 00:15:28,333
Fluid of renewed life?

372
00:15:28,416 --> 00:15:29,750
Oh, my Jesus!

373
00:15:29,833 --> 00:15:31,583
Boys, "fluid of renewed life"

374
00:15:31,666 --> 00:15:35,041
sure sounds like a fancy way of saying
"fucking horse load" to me!

375
00:15:35,125 --> 00:15:36,458
What the fuck?

376
00:15:36,541 --> 00:15:38,666
This is horse piss we're standing in!

377
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:40,625
Get the fuck out of there, boys!

378
00:15:40,708 --> 00:15:43,458
It's an ancient ritual,
started on our leader's planet

379
00:15:43,541 --> 00:15:44,666
thousands of years--

380
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:47,125
I'm not floating around in horse piss
and drinking horse cum!

381
00:15:47,208 --> 00:15:49,583
-Fuck that!
-What the hell's going on here, Julianne?

382
00:15:49,666 --> 00:15:51,333
How'd you get the horse load
from the horse?

383
00:15:51,416 --> 00:15:53,958
I extracted the sacred fluid
of renewed life,

384
00:15:54,041 --> 00:15:57,833
-and I worked hard for that honor.
-Oh, my God, he's a horse jacker!

385
00:15:57,916 --> 00:16:01,125
Call me crazy, but it seems
like there's two options here.

386
00:16:01,208 --> 00:16:03,583
Stay right here,
swim around in horse piss,

387
00:16:03,666 --> 00:16:05,791
drink its milky, fucking magical pudding,

388
00:16:05,875 --> 00:16:08,208
or get the fuck in the car
and get out of here!

389
00:16:08,291 --> 00:16:10,291
I guess you're right.
This is pretty fucked up.

390
00:16:10,375 --> 00:16:14,958
You left me once before, Julian.
I will not let that happen again.

391
00:16:15,083 --> 00:16:16,916
[guns cocking]

392
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,166
All right, you weird fucks.

393
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:20,916
Get the fuck out of our way,
or I start blowing body parts off,

394
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,666
starting with that golden,
fucked-up horse's sacred cock

395
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:25,000
and sacred bag!

396
00:16:25,083 --> 00:16:27,583
Put your gun down, now!
You're outnumbered!

397
00:16:27,666 --> 00:16:29,791
Yeah, by a bunch of church nerds!
Fuck you!

398
00:16:29,875 --> 00:16:30,916
-Put your gun down.
-Shoot!

399
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,125
Everybody put your guns down!

400
00:16:32,208 --> 00:16:35,833
Please, just let us leave.
We won't tell anybody how fucked you are.

401
00:16:35,916 --> 00:16:37,416
Nobody can leave.

402
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:40,958
It would jeopardize everything
we've worked so hard for.

403
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:43,333
You can't leave!
You will adapt to our ways,

404
00:16:43,416 --> 00:16:45,666
and you will be happier
than you've ever been.

405
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:47,375
-I get it. I get all of it.
-[man] Adapt or die!

406
00:16:47,458 --> 00:16:49,625
And I get you,
and that's all that matters.

407
00:16:49,708 --> 00:16:51,125
Boys, I'm staying.

408
00:16:51,208 --> 00:16:53,166
-What?
-You just have to let my friends go.

409
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:55,083
Julian, you can't fucking stay here.

410
00:16:55,166 --> 00:16:57,208
-Are you fucked?
-You don't understand.

411
00:16:57,291 --> 00:17:00,041
I really, really like her,
and I've made up my mind!

412
00:17:00,125 --> 00:17:01,166
I'm dying anyway.

413
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:03,875
I just wanna spend the rest of my days
with Julianne.

414
00:17:03,958 --> 00:17:06,166
I will welcome you into my heart.

415
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:10,375
But only if you consume
the fluid of renewed life.

416
00:17:10,458 --> 00:17:11,541
[laughs]

417
00:17:11,625 --> 00:17:14,083
And then, we'll let your friends go.

418
00:17:14,708 --> 00:17:15,583
I love you.

419
00:17:15,666 --> 00:17:16,708
I love you too.

420
00:17:17,416 --> 00:17:18,291
Cheers, boys.

421
00:17:18,375 --> 00:17:19,541
Oh, my fuck.

422
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:21,083
[horse snorting]

423
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:24,333
[sipping]

424
00:17:24,416 --> 00:17:26,750
[gags, coughs]

425
00:17:27,333 --> 00:17:28,166
[chugging]

426
00:17:29,583 --> 00:17:30,875
[Bubbles groans]

427
00:17:31,666 --> 00:17:32,833
[Ricky] No. Ugh.

428
00:17:32,916 --> 00:17:36,166
Okay, so Julian has officially swallowed
horse load.

429
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:39,166
We are in the fucking upside down now,
folks.

430
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:41,750
Now the rest,
or your friends have to stay.

431
00:17:41,833 --> 00:17:43,791
-[voices] Drink it! Drink his essence!
<i>-</i>The rest?

432
00:17:43,875 --> 00:17:44,875
-Just a second.
-[man] Drink it!

433
00:17:44,958 --> 00:17:47,291
Just give me a second here.
You got your lighter?

434
00:17:47,375 --> 00:17:48,750
-Yeah.
-Good, take a big drink.

435
00:17:48,833 --> 00:17:50,666
It's time for you to do
that Gene Simmons thing.

436
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:51,666
Yeah!

437
00:17:53,833 --> 00:17:56,416
-[flames blasting]
-[screaming]

438
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:57,625
Fuck! My larynx!

439
00:17:57,708 --> 00:18:00,000
Nice going, Ricky!
Let's get the fuck out of here!

440
00:18:00,083 --> 00:18:01,041
Ricky, your hair!

441
00:18:01,125 --> 00:18:02,166
Goddammit! Fuck!

442
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:03,708
[Julian] Let's go!

443
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:04,833
-[screaming]
-[horse neighs]

444
00:18:04,916 --> 00:18:05,750
[Julian] Come on!

445
00:18:06,666 --> 00:18:08,375
Fuck! Wait up! I got piss in my mouth!

446
00:18:09,291 --> 00:18:11,750
[Ricky] Get in, boys, I'll cover you!
Fuck you!

447
00:18:11,833 --> 00:18:14,000
-[gunshot]
-Fucking horse-jacking weirdos!

448
00:18:14,083 --> 00:18:16,375
-[gunshot]
-[dramatic music playing]

449
00:18:16,875 --> 00:18:17,708
[crashing]

450
00:18:17,791 --> 00:18:22,166
[Bubbles humming]

451
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:24,916
Well, that was quite a road trip.

452
00:18:25,291 --> 00:18:28,416
Yeah, that was… something else, wasn't it?

453
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:30,791
So, guess as they say, we should probably

454
00:18:30,875 --> 00:18:32,750
impress the elephant in the room,
should we?

455
00:18:32,833 --> 00:18:35,041
Ricky, let's not even go there, okay?

456
00:18:35,125 --> 00:18:37,958
Even though I'm sure
we're probably all thinking

457
00:18:38,041 --> 00:18:40,208
about that stuff going down
Julian's throat,

458
00:18:40,291 --> 00:18:42,666
and now it's sitting right there
in his stomach.

459
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:45,166
That was a huge sacrifice
you made for us, Julian.

460
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:47,416
It sure was.
Looked like it was tough to get down.

461
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:49,875
-What did it taste like?
-What did I just say?

462
00:18:49,958 --> 00:18:51,208
-Was it tangy, or--
-Ricky!

463
00:18:51,291 --> 00:18:52,916
Well, I just-- Was it gamey?

464
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,125
Did it taste like the humanly stuff?
I don't know.

465
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:59,500
Dudes, ladies in robes, fields of weed.

466
00:18:59,583 --> 00:19:00,750
Horse urine baths.

467
00:19:00,833 --> 00:19:03,083
Ricky doing Gene Simmons
fire-breathing shit.

468
00:19:03,166 --> 00:19:05,375
-Orgies.
-Guns, people on fire.

469
00:19:05,458 --> 00:19:07,375
I'd have done anything to have been there.

470
00:19:07,458 --> 00:19:09,250
Yeah, it was a fucking crazy place.

471
00:19:09,333 --> 00:19:12,083
I thought about staying there forever.
But Julian decided to cross

472
00:19:12,166 --> 00:19:14,250
"drinking fucking horse cum"
off his fuck-it list.

473
00:19:14,333 --> 00:19:16,000
It wasn't on my fuck-it list.

474
00:19:16,083 --> 00:19:18,416
Sorry, dude,
I thought you said "horse cum."

475
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:19,916
-Yeah, he drank horse cum.
-Enough!

476
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,875
Look, we owe our freedom to Julian, Ricky.
We shall never speak of the things

477
00:19:23,958 --> 00:19:26,500
that were ingested at the place
with the weirdies, ever again.

478
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:27,791
I'll drink to that.

479
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:30,166
I bet. Probably still taste
that horse cum, do you?

480
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:31,083
Ricky!

481
00:19:31,166 --> 00:19:33,625
Can everybody just please
stop saying "horse cum"?

482
00:19:33,708 --> 00:19:34,750
Yes, please.

483
00:19:34,833 --> 00:19:37,041
Well, at least I got to see Julianne
before I died.

484
00:19:37,125 --> 00:19:39,791
I wondered what my life would've been like
if I'd stayed with her.

485
00:19:39,875 --> 00:19:41,000
It would have been fucked,

486
00:19:41,083 --> 00:19:42,791
and you wouldn't have any of us
in your life.

487
00:19:42,875 --> 00:19:46,125
You're right. No regrets.
I love the life I've had with you guys.

488
00:19:46,208 --> 00:19:48,208
Sad it's all gonna end, though, soon.

489
00:19:48,291 --> 00:19:51,208
Maybe it's not. We should go
to the psychic. Maybe you cheated death.

490
00:19:51,291 --> 00:19:52,875
-You think so?
-Wouldn't hurt to find out.

491
00:19:52,958 --> 00:19:54,583
We could talk to Ronnie. He knows her.

492
00:19:54,666 --> 00:19:57,458
-Might be able to get her to your trailer.
-What? Ronnie who?

493
00:19:57,541 --> 00:19:59,250
Ronnie Dempsey,
chili dog guy from the fair.

494
00:19:59,333 --> 00:20:03,125
-You know him, used to live in the park.
-Oh, my fuck, that was Ronnie Dempsey?

495
00:20:03,208 --> 00:20:06,125
I didn't recognize him with the eye patch
and the teeth missing.

496
00:20:06,208 --> 00:20:07,958
Yeah, man,
lost his eye and his teeth in jail.

497
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:10,375
Crazy fucking fight with Teddy the Badger.
Remember him?

498
00:20:10,458 --> 00:20:12,458
-Yep.
-Fucking Teddy lost his arm and his nose.

499
00:20:12,541 --> 00:20:13,375
It was fucked!

500
00:20:13,458 --> 00:20:17,083
Jesus Christ! Ronnie's the one
who drove me home from the animal shelter

501
00:20:17,166 --> 00:20:20,541
-the day I got Vince the Pince.
-Fucking right on. He's a nice guy.

502
00:20:20,625 --> 00:20:22,500
No, you're not understanding me here.

503
00:20:22,583 --> 00:20:24,458
You don't think Ronnie
could've told the psychic

504
00:20:24,541 --> 00:20:26,125
all the shit about us when he saw us?

505
00:20:26,541 --> 00:20:29,333
I doubt it. Just 'cause he's banging her
doesn't mean he's gonna tell her

506
00:20:29,416 --> 00:20:31,541
-everything about us.
-He's banging the psychic?

507
00:20:31,625 --> 00:20:33,041
She's like 80, isn't she?

508
00:20:33,125 --> 00:20:36,333
I know, Ronnie likes them whizzled up.
Said she's a fucking wildcat.

509
00:20:36,416 --> 00:20:39,875
Ricky, I don't think the fact
that Ronnie likes whizzled-up oldies

510
00:20:39,958 --> 00:20:40,875
is the issue here.

511
00:20:40,958 --> 00:20:44,125
Use your fucking brain!
That's how she knew everything about us.

512
00:20:44,208 --> 00:20:45,833
No, man. No way, not a chance.

513
00:20:45,916 --> 00:20:49,416
-Ricky, you are so fucked in the head.
-Am I missing something here?

514
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:52,750
Yes! I can't believe that asshole psychic
said I was gonna die.

515
00:20:52,833 --> 00:20:54,833
That phony fucking old hag.

516
00:20:54,916 --> 00:20:57,166
So, Julian went down on a horse
for nothing?

517
00:20:57,250 --> 00:20:58,875
No, I didn't blow a horse, Cory.

518
00:20:58,958 --> 00:21:01,041
I drank a tiny bit of its load
to save these guys.

519
00:21:01,125 --> 00:21:02,166
That's what friends do.

520
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:04,666
Can we not talk about this
and just get drunk now?

521
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:06,750
-Yeah, dude, sure.
-Give me a toke, Rick.

522
00:21:06,833 --> 00:21:08,291
Not off this. You can have your own.

523
00:21:08,375 --> 00:21:11,083
Just in case you have
some of that horse cum left on your lips.

524

[man whispers]<i> Fuck off.</i>

1
00:00:13,083 --> 00:00:15,083
Uh, check it out, fellas.

2
00:00:15,166 --> 00:00:18,250
Been a long time since I fired up
one of these cocksuckers.

3
00:00:18,333 --> 00:00:20,416
Oh, you guys are gonna love this one.

4
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:21,750
[cats meowing]

5
00:00:21,833 --> 00:00:24,500
Just hold on, now. Give it a second.

6
00:00:24,583 --> 00:00:25,458
[whirring]

00:00:25,541 --> 00:00:28,041

-[meowing]

8
00:00:28,125 --> 00:00:30,916
Oh, my fuck,
those are scrump-dilly for a kitty!

9
00:00:31,625 --> 00:00:35,666
Hey. I'm not a math-a-magician like you.
Can you tell me what that number is?

10
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:37,041
Is it 500 or is it 5,000?

11
00:00:37,625 --> 00:00:39,541
[Bubbles] No, Ricky, that's 500,000.

12
00:00:40,625 --> 00:00:42,500
Just hold on! What the fuck is this?

13
00:00:42,583 --> 00:00:45,833
It says Mo has $500,000 in the bank.

14
00:00:45,916 --> 00:00:47,666
My God, Ricky, what did you do?

15
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:50,333
Nothing. I went to the bank to put $50
in Mo's account.

16
00:00:50,416 --> 00:00:53,000
It was gonna be 70,
but I had to borrow 20 for smokes and--

17
00:00:53,083 --> 00:00:55,166
Yeah, but how is there 500 grand
in there?

18
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:58,000
-What the fuck happened?
-Nothing. Just went to the bank.

19
00:00:59,166 --> 00:01:00,166
How can I help you?

20
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:02,791
Hey, beautiful. I want to deposit
some money in the bank.

21
00:01:02,875 --> 00:01:05,208
-What do they call that again?
-A deposit, sir?

22
00:01:05,291 --> 00:01:07,083
Yeah. What's it called?

23
00:01:07,166 --> 00:01:08,791
It's called a deposit, sir.

24
00:01:08,875 --> 00:01:11,791
-I'm sorry, you can't smoke in here.
-Why not?

25
00:01:11,875 --> 00:01:14,208
-There's no signs that say I can't.
-There's no signs

26
00:01:14,291 --> 00:01:16,875
because you're in a public building,
and it's understood.

27
00:01:16,958 --> 00:01:19,458
Well, it's not understood,
'cause I'm fucking smoking.

28
00:01:19,541 --> 00:01:22,083
Whose fault is that?
Yours, for not putting up fucking signs.

29
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:25,500
I'm sorry,  but I'm going to have
to ask you to put that out.

30
00:01:25,583 --> 00:01:27,458
No problem there, granny.
I'll put it out…

31
00:01:27,541 --> 00:01:30,500
as soon as I'm good
and goddamn done with the fucking thing.

32
00:01:30,583 --> 00:01:31,791
Okay. Enough.

33
00:01:31,875 --> 00:01:33,250
Security!

34
00:01:33,333 --> 00:01:36,625
-Let's go. You're out of here, sir.
-Fuck off, mall cop.

35
00:01:36,708 --> 00:01:38,291
-I got bank business to do.
-Time to go.

36
00:01:38,375 --> 00:01:40,375
If you're gonna grab someone,
grab my horse cock!

37
00:01:40,458 --> 00:01:43,541
-Don't make this difficult.
-And then suck it! Fuck off!

38
00:01:44,291 --> 00:01:47,250
-You deposit this right the fuck now!
-Time to go, sir!

39
00:01:47,333 --> 00:01:49,333
[men struggling]

40
00:01:49,416 --> 00:01:50,250
Cunt!

41
00:01:50,333 --> 00:01:52,166
So, yeah, it was their fucking fault.

42
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:54,250
-I didn't do anything.
-Oh, yeah, no.

43
00:01:54,333 --> 00:01:57,500
Fuck, Ricky.
Assaulting a guard, that's nothing at all.

44
00:01:57,583 --> 00:01:59,708
Oh, my God,
she must have got so freaked out

45
00:01:59,791 --> 00:02:03,791
-that she typed in the wrong amount.
-Oh, my fuck, so she fucked up!

46
00:02:03,875 --> 00:02:06,291
This is free fucking money!
I'm fucking rich!

47
00:02:06,375 --> 00:02:09,208
-No, it doesn't work like that.
-Julian, get the fuck out here!

48
00:02:09,291 --> 00:02:10,666
We're fucking rich!

49
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:11,583
Oh, boy.

50
00:02:11,666 --> 00:02:16,375
[piano theme music playing]

51
00:02:19,583 --> 00:02:21,916
Okay, here we go.
Give me Mo's bank card, man.

52
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,958
Get ready. We're about to be set for life.

53
00:02:24,041 --> 00:02:26,041
These are my kind of fucking banks.
You can smoke.

54
00:02:26,125 --> 00:02:29,666
How about we not do this? I mean,
it's not like we can keep this money.

55
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:32,291
Relax, Bubs.
Okay, Ricky, what's the PIN number?

56
00:02:32,375 --> 00:02:34,041
It's the numbers of when Mo got bornt.

57
00:02:34,125 --> 00:02:36,333
Okay, so what is it?

58
00:02:37,125 --> 00:02:39,000
Fuck. It's Aug-nust, isn't it?

59
00:02:39,083 --> 00:02:42,333
Are you fucking kidding me?
You don't know Mo's fucking birthday?

60
00:02:42,416 --> 00:02:45,416
[sighs] It's six, two, ten. Jesus, Ricky.

61
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:46,833
How did you know that?

62
00:02:46,916 --> 00:02:49,875
We just had his birthday party
two fucking weeks ago.

63
00:02:49,958 --> 00:02:52,125
Holy shit! Jackpot, boys!

64
00:02:52,208 --> 00:02:56,041
Account balance:
500 fucking thousand dollars.

65
00:02:56,125 --> 00:02:56,958
You kidding me?

66
00:02:57,041 --> 00:02:59,750
My fuck! We're fucking billionaires!

67
00:02:59,833 --> 00:03:01,375
We are not billionaires.

68
00:03:01,458 --> 00:03:04,500
Stop this shit right the fuck now.
This is the bank's money,

69
00:03:04,583 --> 00:03:07,208
-and we're not taking it.
-Okay. Bubs is right, here.

70
00:03:07,291 --> 00:03:11,000
-They're gonna come looking for it.
-Finally, you're making some sense.

71
00:03:11,083 --> 00:03:13,875
That's why we have to spend this money
as soon as fucking possible.

72
00:03:13,958 --> 00:03:16,333
I'm telling you, if we get caught, we're--

This has to stop right now, boys.

79
00:03:43,125 --> 00:03:46,041
I mean, spending all this money at once
is a huge red flag,

80
00:03:46,125 --> 00:03:48,500
and it's gonna bite us in the fucking ass.

81
00:03:48,583 --> 00:03:51,666
-Bubs, we're being smart about it.
-Smart?

82
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:55,333
Julian, you look like you guys just robbed
Mr. T and fucking Slick Rick.

83
00:03:55,416 --> 00:03:58,250
-We look fucking good, don't we?
-Yeah, it's called success.

84
00:03:58,333 --> 00:03:59,375
Yeah, success.

85
00:03:59,458 --> 00:04:02,833
What a fucking extraordinary
life achievement this is, boys.

86
00:04:02,916 --> 00:04:04,750
I know. It feels fucking great.

87
00:04:04,833 --> 00:04:08,166
[sighs] Just give me
the goddamn bank card, please.

88
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:12,291
-This is fucking out of control!
-Okay, Bubs, we'll slow down. I promise.

89
00:04:12,958 --> 00:04:13,791
Good.

90
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:15,625
We just have one more stop.

[brakes hard]

92
00:04:19,208 --> 00:04:22,541
There it is, boys.
Look at that dirty, filthy bastard.

94
00:04:24,416 --> 00:04:26,750
Julian, you're not paying
three fucking grand

95
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:30,500
-for a goddamn bottle of rum!
-Oh, yes, I fucking am, Bubs.

96
00:04:30,583 --> 00:04:33,291
My old man always talked
about being rich enough to try it.

97
00:04:33,375 --> 00:04:36,250
He said people like him
don't get to drink that kind of liquor.

98
00:04:36,333 --> 00:04:37,791
Well, guess what, boys?

99
00:04:37,875 --> 00:04:38,875
I'm gonna.

100
00:04:38,958 --> 00:04:40,291
For him, today.

101
00:04:40,375 --> 00:04:41,458
She's a beaut, eh?

102
00:04:41,541 --> 00:04:43,083
That bottle's older than I am.

103
00:04:43,166 --> 00:04:44,916
And more expensive than my car.

104
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,583
Fuck off with the sales pitch there,
dick torch.

105
00:04:47,666 --> 00:04:49,250
Get the keys out. We're taking it.

106
00:04:49,333 --> 00:04:51,583
Uh, do you know
how much that bottle's worth?

107
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:55,000
Fuck off! Do you know how much
that glass door is worth? Huh?

108
00:04:55,083 --> 00:04:57,666
I'm guessing it's worth about this much.
[smashing]

109
00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:00,416
Haha, nice one. And this is for the rum.
Keep the change!

110
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:03,625
Yeah, and take another 200
and get that fucking nose fixed.

111
00:05:03,708 --> 00:05:06,708
-Have a nice day, load for fucking brains.
-[Bubbles] Ricky!

112
00:05:06,791 --> 00:05:10,041
Can we please just go the fuck back
to the park and pretend

113
00:05:10,125 --> 00:05:12,916
-we didn't just commit massive bank fraud?
-Sure, man. No problem.

114
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,916
-Thank you.
-Just one last stop.

115
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,208
-[engine revving]
-What the fuck are you doing?

116
00:05:17,291 --> 00:05:19,500
Why you turning
onto the Penhorn Mall exit?

117
00:05:19,583 --> 00:05:21,875
You're gonna fucking love
this thing, buddy.

118
00:05:21,958 --> 00:05:24,625
What fucking thing?
No more purchases here, boys.

119
00:05:24,708 --> 00:05:27,625
C'mon. Julian got to buy one last thing.
I should get to, too.

120
00:05:27,708 --> 00:05:28,708
Oh, my fuck!

121
00:05:31,375 --> 00:05:34,291
Bubbler, freeze your eyes
on this cocksucker.

122
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:37,208
Holy fuck! A jet pack!

123
00:05:37,333 --> 00:05:40,208
-Decent!
-Me and Julian been spending the money

124
00:05:40,291 --> 00:05:43,000
on us. We figured we'd get you something.
It's all yours, bud.

125
00:05:43,083 --> 00:05:46,291
We're not spending one more fucking penny
of that greasy money.

126
00:05:46,375 --> 00:05:49,458
[gasps] But holy fuck, the JB-9!

127
00:05:49,541 --> 00:05:52,166
Oh, my God,
this fucker's got a foot launch system,

128
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:55,875
nickel alloy,
air-breathing fucking turbine engine.

129
00:05:55,958 --> 00:05:58,166
This cocksucker goes 60 miles per hour.

130
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:02,041
C'mon, strap the fucker on. Give 'er
a try. You know you want to. C'mon!

131
00:06:02,125 --> 00:06:05,125
Okay, but I'm just trying it on,
that's it.

132
00:06:05,208 --> 00:06:06,041
[metal creaking]

133
00:06:06,958 --> 00:06:10,083
Baby, she sure does feel nice.
Look at that!

134
00:06:10,166 --> 00:06:13,208
Dual-hand controls,
just like a fucking motorcycle.

135
00:06:13,291 --> 00:06:16,375
[sighs] Nice gyroscopic balance on her,
too.

136
00:06:16,833 --> 00:06:20,083
Sorry, that's for trained
and certified personnel only, sir.

137
00:06:20,166 --> 00:06:22,458
Just for the record,
I've had full NASA training

138
00:06:22,541 --> 00:06:25,000
by astronaut Chris Hadfield,
and I spent two weeks

139
00:06:25,083 --> 00:06:26,958
on an international space station,
growing weed.

140
00:06:27,041 --> 00:06:29,208
[laughs] Yeah, right!

141
00:06:29,291 --> 00:06:31,791
All three of us did, actually.
Sergeant Suck-me-off.

142
00:06:31,875 --> 00:06:33,833
-Just let him try it out.
-No, sir.

143
00:06:33,916 --> 00:06:35,833
No, sorry. Not without a certificate.

144
00:06:35,916 --> 00:06:37,250
Okay, look.

145
00:06:37,333 --> 00:06:40,500
I've got a lot of certificates here.
How many we talking about?

146
00:06:40,583 --> 00:06:41,541
Okay, this will work.

147
00:06:41,625 --> 00:06:44,166
I'm just gonna give her a quick try.
Maybe I'll just…

148
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:46,541
Maybe I'll just float up
ten feet or so, boys.

149
00:06:46,625 --> 00:06:48,625
-[Bubbles giggles]
-[jet pack puffs air]

150
00:06:48,708 --> 00:06:52,166
-[whooshing blast]
-[Bubbles screams]

151
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:53,333
[engine powers down]

152
00:06:53,416 --> 00:06:55,083
-Decent!
-[jubilant music]

153
00:06:55,166 --> 00:06:56,375
Oh, my fuck!

154
00:06:56,458 --> 00:06:57,541
We'll take it!

155
00:06:57,625 --> 00:06:58,666
[engine blasting]

156
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:01,000
[jet pack whooshing]

157
00:07:01,083 --> 00:07:04,416
Hey, boys, look at me! I'm flying!
[laughing]

158
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,416
Fuck, Julian! It's a bee!

159
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:07,541
It's a fly!

160
00:07:07,625 --> 00:07:09,000
It's Superguy!

161
00:07:09,083 --> 00:07:12,916
[Bubbles laughing in distance]

162
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,083
[jet pack blasting]

163
00:07:14,166 --> 00:07:15,416
Oh, shit cakes.

164
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:16,333
[knocking]

165
00:07:16,416 --> 00:07:19,083
-[Ricky] Fuck off!
-[Julian] Gotta get us out of this.

166
00:07:19,166 --> 00:07:20,500
[whooshing]
Fuck's sakes!

167
00:07:21,666 --> 00:07:22,791
This is it.

168
00:07:22,875 --> 00:07:23,708
The reckoning.

169
00:07:24,625 --> 00:07:26,458
Is something going on here, officer?

170
00:07:26,541 --> 00:07:28,750
I'm officer LeBlanc. This is Mr. Barret.

171
00:07:28,833 --> 00:07:30,625
Good afternoon, Mr. LaFleur.

172
00:07:30,708 --> 00:07:31,958
How do you know my name?

173
00:07:32,041 --> 00:07:35,000
We're very sorry,
but we've found an egregious "error"

174
00:07:35,083 --> 00:07:37,291
in your last transaction at our bank.

175
00:07:37,375 --> 00:07:40,583
We've accidentally deposited $500,000

176
00:07:40,666 --> 00:07:42,500
into your grandson's account.

177
00:07:42,583 --> 00:07:47,000
-We're here to reclaim that money.
-[scoffs] Sorry there, hairpiece.

178
00:07:47,083 --> 00:07:50,208
Take that up with my gramson.
He's not here, so fuck off!

179
00:07:50,291 --> 00:07:54,208
According to our records,
your name is also on his account.

180
00:07:54,291 --> 00:07:55,583
I had nothing to do with it.

181
00:07:55,666 --> 00:07:57,541
And if my gramson
saw the money in the account,

182
00:07:57,625 --> 00:07:58,791
he probably spent most of it.

183
00:07:58,875 --> 00:08:00,750
What the fuck you gonna do?
Put a kid in jail?

184
00:08:00,833 --> 00:08:04,041
You cosigned his account
as the responsible party.

185
00:08:04,125 --> 00:08:07,083
-The bank expects that money back.
-The bank can suck it.

186
00:08:07,166 --> 00:08:09,666
It's finders creepers, if you ask me,
so I don't know what to say.

187
00:08:10,166 --> 00:08:12,458
Sorry, but that's not how this works.

188
00:08:12,541 --> 00:08:16,666
We want the money back immediately,
or we press charges.

189
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:18,750
Whoa, okay. How about I give you

190
00:08:18,833 --> 00:08:21,625
30 grand right now, cash,
and we forget this ever happened?

191
00:08:21,708 --> 00:08:23,750
And nobody will find out
how bad you guys fucked up.

192
00:08:23,833 --> 00:08:27,500
Ricky, just stop talking. Look, sir,
this must be a big misunderstanding.

193
00:08:27,583 --> 00:08:31,000
How about we talk to our lawyer,
and we'll have it all figured out, okay?

194
00:08:31,083 --> 00:08:31,916
And in the meantime,

195
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,541
you can drive both of these
right up your fucking ass.

196
00:08:35,458 --> 00:08:38,291
[man] Well, boys, to put it succinctly,
you're fucked.

197
00:08:38,375 --> 00:08:40,666
Banks are real hardcore prick squeezers.

198
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:43,791
Prosecute you to the fullest extent
of the law. Trust me.

199
00:08:43,875 --> 00:08:46,500
Well, what if we return
what we haven't spent?

200
00:08:46,583 --> 00:08:50,333
Well, they might be more lenient,
and it could buy you more time, maybe.

201
00:08:50,416 --> 00:08:51,791
How much is left, exactly?

202
00:08:51,875 --> 00:08:54,250
I think there's around 250 grand,
give or take.

203
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:58,125
Uh, little more take than give, actually.
There was a bit of an incident.

204
00:08:58,208 --> 00:09:00,833
What does that mean, Ricky?
What did you do?

205
00:09:00,916 --> 00:09:02,250
[rock music playing]

206
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:03,750
Oh, fuck, yeah!

207
00:09:03,833 --> 00:09:05,958
Let's see what kind of balls
you got there, Lamba-genie!

208
00:09:06,041 --> 00:09:08,583
[engine revs]

209
00:09:08,666 --> 00:09:10,041
-[tires squeal]
-[Ricky screams]

210
00:09:10,125 --> 00:09:10,958
Fucked her!

211
00:09:11,041 --> 00:09:14,583
-[crashing]
-[glass breaking]

212
00:09:14,666 --> 00:09:16,625
-[squirrel chirping]
-[explosion]

213
00:09:16,708 --> 00:09:18,375
-Fuck!
-[car horn blares]

214
00:09:18,458 --> 00:09:19,458
Unbelievable!

215
00:09:19,541 --> 00:09:21,583
You had a half a million fucking dollars,

216
00:09:21,666 --> 00:09:24,458
and it literally took you guys four days
to get in debt.

217
00:09:24,541 --> 00:09:26,416
Okay, Steinberg, what're we doing here?

218
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:29,583
They're gonna want all of it back.
And they'll keep coming after you

219
00:09:29,666 --> 00:09:32,583
until you're either
in jail for life or dead.

220
00:09:32,666 --> 00:09:34,875
Fuck's sakes.
I guess I gotta get dead, then.

221
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:36,791
You're not getting yourself fucking dead.

222
00:09:36,875 --> 00:09:38,666
You heard what he fucking said.
I have to!

223
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:41,166
I mean, I love jail,
but I'm not going there for life.

224
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:44,750
Okay, so we probably should set up
a nice little life insurance policy.

225
00:09:44,833 --> 00:09:47,583
And I can do all the paperwork.
We split it fifty-fifty.

226
00:09:47,666 --> 00:09:50,250
What? No fucking life insurance policy.

227
00:09:50,333 --> 00:09:53,250
-Nobody's getting fucking dead.
-So I guess we're fucked.

228
00:09:53,333 --> 00:09:54,958
[tutting]

229
00:09:55,041 --> 00:09:58,000
Well, there is one thing
people have done in the past,

230
00:09:58,083 --> 00:10:01,291
but it's not gonna be cheap
for me to tell you, I mean.

231
00:10:01,375 --> 00:10:03,166
Jesus Christ, you're greasy.

232
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:04,416
What is it?

233
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:07,166
I heard about a guy
who got out of a situation like this

234
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:08,541
by faking his own death.

235
00:10:08,625 --> 00:10:09,750
Faking his death?

236
00:10:09,833 --> 00:10:12,708
Yeah, he bought some teeth
and bones off a guy somewhere,

237
00:10:12,791 --> 00:10:15,000
laid them on his couch,
burned his house down.

238
00:10:15,083 --> 00:10:17,416
He was a real loser,
so no one investigated it.

239
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:20,208
-Worked like a charm.
-Perfect. Let's fucking do it, boys.

240
00:10:20,291 --> 00:10:21,125
Hang the fuck on!

241
00:10:21,208 --> 00:10:25,250
We're not buying teeth and fucking bones
and burning goddamn houses down!

242
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:27,791
Now, just a second.
Maybe we don't have to.

243
00:10:27,875 --> 00:10:31,166
What are you thinking? I can see
the grease coming out of your ears.

244
00:10:32,041 --> 00:10:34,708
-[Bubbles whimpers]
-Wait, where did you get a jet pack?

245
00:10:34,791 --> 00:10:36,791
What the fuck does it matter, Ted?
[sniffs]

246
00:10:36,875 --> 00:10:39,083
I-- Ricky took it up over the water.

247
00:10:39,166 --> 00:10:41,666
Yeah, he went fucking way out there,
too, Ted.

248
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:43,875
Like, he was just a little speck
on the horizon.

249
00:10:43,958 --> 00:10:46,708
I'll admit, he was drunk
and he was high, but...

250
00:10:46,791 --> 00:10:48,791
he wanted to see
those goddamn whales fuck.

251
00:10:48,875 --> 00:10:50,750
That was ten hours ago, Ted.

252
00:10:50,833 --> 00:10:53,375
-He loved to watch whales fuck.
-Mm-hm.

253
00:10:53,458 --> 00:10:56,875
[signs] Just his jet pack washed up
on the shore, Ted.

254
00:10:56,958 --> 00:10:58,083
All by itself.

255
00:10:58,166 --> 00:10:59,541
My best friend, he's…

256
00:10:59,625 --> 00:11:01,625
he's probably whale food right now.

257
00:11:01,708 --> 00:11:04,041
-Poor Ricky. Gone forever.
-[melancholic music plays]

258
00:11:04,125 --> 00:11:07,583
[sighs] I guess the only thing
we can do is get the paperwork done up,

259
00:11:07,666 --> 00:11:08,583
and then we'll…

260
00:11:08,666 --> 00:11:10,666
we'll go tell poor Trinity the news.

261
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:13,000
Hang on. First of all, he's just missing.

262
00:11:13,083 --> 00:11:15,041
Nobody's dead until we find a body.

263
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:16,375
What? But...

264
00:11:16,458 --> 00:11:19,041
But he's gone! Like, he's a deadie!

265
00:11:21,291 --> 00:11:23,208
Well, we're fucked here, boys.

266
00:11:23,291 --> 00:11:26,458
There's nothing online here I can find
that can make somebody seem dead

267
00:11:26,541 --> 00:11:28,208
without them actually being dead.

268
00:11:28,291 --> 00:11:30,791
How about we get a mannequin,
dress it like Ricky,

269
00:11:30,875 --> 00:11:32,250
then Ricky could pee on it,

270
00:11:32,333 --> 00:11:34,333
then that's his DNA all over the shit.

271
00:11:34,416 --> 00:11:37,208
We throw it off the bridge,
cops come and find a body,

272
00:11:37,291 --> 00:11:38,583
and then there's DNA all on it.

273
00:11:38,666 --> 00:11:40,958
When they do the test,
it's Ricky, and he's dead.

274
00:11:41,041 --> 00:11:43,625
Yeah! That's not a bad idea, Cory.

275
00:11:43,708 --> 00:11:46,041
-Then they'll have a body.
-No, they won't have a body.

276
00:11:46,125 --> 00:11:47,750
They'll have a mannequin covered in piss.

277
00:11:47,833 --> 00:11:50,958
My mom said when I was five, I died
for two hours after eating a peanut.

278
00:11:51,041 --> 00:11:52,125
Jesus, shut up, Jacob.

279
00:11:52,208 --> 00:11:54,500
-What are these guys doing here?
-Yo, we're helping.

280
00:11:54,583 --> 00:11:57,041
Hold on.
Hold right the fuck on to your nuts, boys.

281
00:11:57,125 --> 00:11:59,666
Check this out. This might be it.

282
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:02,875
It says here there's a drug
that slows down your functions

283
00:12:02,958 --> 00:12:06,125
to where you will cease
to have a detectable pulse or heartbeat.

284
00:12:06,666 --> 00:12:07,750
Decent.

285
00:12:07,833 --> 00:12:11,583
It's an offshoot of digoxin.
It's called "the zombie drug."

286
00:12:11,666 --> 00:12:12,750
Perfect. Let's do it.

287
00:12:12,833 --> 00:12:16,333
Whoa, I don't know, man.
Being a zombie sounds kind of fucked, no?

288
00:12:16,416 --> 00:12:18,666
Yeah, I don't want Ricky coming after me,
eating my brains.

289
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:21,833
That wouldn't be a very big meal there.
It'd be more of a snack.

290
00:12:21,916 --> 00:12:24,458
Look, it's either this or jail.
What do you wanna do here?

291
00:12:24,541 --> 00:12:27,541
Hold on. This drug isn't even legal,
and it's hard to find.

292
00:12:28,166 --> 00:12:31,166
[sighs] It's not like we're gonna be able
to run down to fucking Costco

293
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:32,750
and grab a case of this, boys.

294
00:12:32,833 --> 00:12:34,583
Uh, they're closed today, dude.

295
00:12:34,666 --> 00:12:35,708
Boys, I got an idea.

296
00:12:35,791 --> 00:12:37,833
Don't think we're going
the fuck down to--

297
00:12:37,916 --> 00:12:39,583
[tires squealing]

298
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,583
-[Julian] Sam!
-[banging]

299
00:12:43,666 --> 00:12:46,708
-Christ, boys, sounds like he's banging.
-Yeah, banging what, though?

300
00:12:46,791 --> 00:12:48,125
Sam's got nothing to bang with.

301
00:12:48,208 --> 00:12:50,250
He's just got
that weather-beaten-looking, old hole

302
00:12:50,333 --> 00:12:52,500
from where the bear
ripped his cock off and ate it.

303
00:12:52,583 --> 00:12:54,791
Sam! Come on, man.
We've gotta talk to you!

304
00:12:54,875 --> 00:12:56,041
[door opens]

305
00:12:56,125 --> 00:12:58,333
What do you want?
I'm in the middle of something.

306
00:12:58,416 --> 00:12:59,291
Holy fuck, Sam!

307
00:12:59,375 --> 00:13:02,083
Where'd you get that big, black cock?
Is that real?

308
00:13:02,166 --> 00:13:03,791
Oh, my fuck! It is, too!

309
00:13:03,875 --> 00:13:06,875
Fucking magnificent, isn't it?
I got it off this basketball player.

310
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:10,166
I figure, "Hey, if I gotta replace it,
might as well do it right, eh?"

311
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:13,375
Anyway, he got killed juggling machetes
at a frat party,

312
00:13:13,458 --> 00:13:14,958
and I attached it on myself.

313
00:13:15,041 --> 00:13:19,125
I got 30% of my pleasure back so far.
Just wait till it fucking gets full steam.

314
00:13:19,208 --> 00:13:21,041
That's great. We're real happy for you.

315
00:13:21,125 --> 00:13:23,208
Look, we need that drug
that lowers your heart rate

316
00:13:23,291 --> 00:13:26,333
to make it look like someone's dead.
They call it the zombie drug.

317
00:13:26,416 --> 00:13:27,916
You mean digoxin?

318
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,791
Yes, exactly. That's the one.

319
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:33,375
We need to make Ricky dead for a day.
We got caught up in some fucking bullshit.

320
00:13:33,458 --> 00:13:34,916
Sorry, I don't have it,

321
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,041
-but I might be able to--
-[man] Where'd you go?

322
00:13:37,125 --> 00:13:40,208
Jesus Murphy, Sam.
Who do you got back there, Barry White?

323
00:13:40,291 --> 00:13:42,458
[laughs] Sounds like another bear
wants to eat your cock.

324
00:13:42,541 --> 00:13:45,125
Guys-- Just shut the fuck up.
What were you saying?

325
00:13:45,208 --> 00:13:48,333
I know a guy at a funeral home
who might be able to take care of you.

326
00:13:48,416 --> 00:13:50,458
He does these scams all the time.

327
00:13:50,541 --> 00:13:52,958
He gives you the drug,
lays you out for viewing,

328
00:13:53,083 --> 00:13:56,000
and you wake up 24 hours later,
and then you just fuck off somewhere.

329
00:13:56,083 --> 00:13:57,875
Just give him a cut
of the life insurance.

330
00:13:57,958 --> 00:13:58,791
Okay, we're in.

331
00:14:01,083 --> 00:14:02,791
Once he's injected,

332
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:06,833
we lay him in the coffin
and then roll him out for viewing.

333
00:14:06,916 --> 00:14:09,500
Then, he should wake up in about 24 hours.

334
00:14:09,583 --> 00:14:12,916
Hold on there, Bela Lugosi.
What the fuck do you mean "should"?

335
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,125
Well, on very <i>rare</i> occasions,

336
00:14:15,208 --> 00:14:19,458
the individual may need an adrenaline shot
straight to the heart in order to...

337
00:14:19,541 --> 00:14:20,958
[gasps] reanimate him.

338
00:14:21,041 --> 00:14:22,416
[sighs] Jesus Murphy.

339
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:26,208
[gasps] Sam didn't say anything
about this <i>Pulp Fiction</i> shit, boys.

340
00:14:26,291 --> 00:14:29,166
[sighs] I don't know about this.
This is freaking me out.

341
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:31,416
C'mon, that was a good movie.
Let's do this.

342
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:35,458
After this big fucking nap, I'll be rested
and ready to party for fucking weeks.

343
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:36,583
Hit me there, Drac.

344
00:14:36,666 --> 00:14:38,291
See you tomorrow, boys.

345
00:14:38,375 --> 00:14:40,000
[lowered voice] Ah, yes.

346
00:14:41,166 --> 00:14:42,041
There.

347
00:14:42,125 --> 00:14:43,666
Count backwards from ten.

348
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:45,958
All right. What do I start with?

349
00:14:46,541 --> 00:14:47,375
With ten.

350
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:49,000
Okay.

351
00:14:49,083 --> 00:14:50,458
Ten, nine...

352
00:14:50,541 --> 00:14:52,333
-Yes?
-…seven?

353
00:14:52,416 --> 00:14:53,375
Eight...

354
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:56,333
Jesus! He's out just like that?

355
00:14:56,875 --> 00:14:59,083
Nighty night, sweet prince.

356
00:14:59,833 --> 00:15:01,166
Oh, my fuck.

357
00:15:01,958 --> 00:15:03,458
Hey, Ted, Julian here. We…

358
00:15:03,541 --> 00:15:06,375
We found Ricky's...
He's washed up onshore. He's dead.

359
00:15:06,875 --> 00:15:08,875
-[Bubbles cries]
-No, I'm serious. He's dead as fuck.

360
00:15:08,958 --> 00:15:11,000
-He's at the funeral home right now.
-Poor Ricky!

361
00:15:11,083 --> 00:15:13,166
Come see for yourself
if you don't believe me.

362
00:15:13,958 --> 00:15:17,666
Now that Richard's no longer with us,
we'd like to close out his bank account.

363
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:19,083
Yeah, for his family.

364
00:15:19,208 --> 00:15:22,041
Here's his Social Insurance Number,
his ID, and his…

365
00:15:22,125 --> 00:15:23,125
death certificate.

366
00:15:23,958 --> 00:15:24,833
[Bubbles whimpers]

367
00:15:24,916 --> 00:15:28,041
Wow, there is still a lot of money owed
on this account.

368
00:15:28,375 --> 00:15:30,500
I'm sure he wishes he was still with us

369
00:15:30,583 --> 00:15:32,875
to take care
of those discrepancies, but…

370
00:15:32,958 --> 00:15:35,458
looks like God had a different plan, sir.

371
00:15:35,541 --> 00:15:37,000
Sent him to the land of the deadies.

372
00:15:37,833 --> 00:15:39,041
Well, if we're all done here,

373
00:15:39,125 --> 00:15:41,583
we'd like to get on with our lives
without our best friend.

374
00:15:41,666 --> 00:15:43,750
Thanks. Let's go, Bubbles.

375
00:15:43,833 --> 00:15:44,666
Bubbles?

376
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:46,250
-Wait. Julian?
-Yeah?

377
00:15:46,333 --> 00:15:48,333
And is Richard fucking Ricky?

378
00:15:48,416 --> 00:15:50,291
That's right. Do we know you?

379
00:15:50,708 --> 00:15:53,625
Fuck, yeah, you do,
you fucking bug-eyed, little freak.

380
00:15:53,708 --> 00:15:56,125
I see your prescription hasn't changed.
[groans]

381
00:15:56,208 --> 00:15:58,208
Oh, my God! Jason Fucknel?

382
00:15:58,291 --> 00:15:59,833
It's Rucknel, asshole!

383
00:15:59,916 --> 00:16:01,583
Gotta be fucking kidding me.

384
00:16:01,666 --> 00:16:02,666
We meet again.

385
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:04,208
And, just like I figured,

386
00:16:04,291 --> 00:16:07,125
you grew up to be
fucking low-life, yard bags,

387
00:16:07,208 --> 00:16:08,125
full of dog shit.

388
00:16:08,208 --> 00:16:11,708
We're adults now, so chill out
on the fucking bullying, Fucknel.

389
00:16:11,791 --> 00:16:15,416
When we were kids,
they were weak little fucking pricks.

390
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:18,625
And, yeah, I beat the shit out of them
every chance I got.

391
00:16:18,708 --> 00:16:20,375
Doesn't mean I was a bully.

392
00:16:20,458 --> 00:16:23,958
I beat them 'cause it made me feel better
about myself.

393
00:16:24,041 --> 00:16:26,250
And because I hate poor people.

394
00:16:26,333 --> 00:16:27,916
Ricky's the fucking bully.

395
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,208
When I was in grade two,

396
00:16:29,291 --> 00:16:31,625
he shot me in my piss hole
with an air rifle.

397
00:16:31,708 --> 00:16:34,333
I still pee
like a fucking clogged-up shower head.

398
00:16:35,416 --> 00:16:38,625
Really, pussy beard?
Where did this certificate come from?

399
00:16:38,708 --> 00:16:41,166
What? Did your mother suck off
a back-alley forger?

400
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:44,708
Jesus Murphy!
Okay, that's uncalled for, Fucknel.

401
00:16:44,791 --> 00:16:47,833
That certificate is real.
Have some respect for the dead.

402
00:16:48,291 --> 00:16:49,375
Right, fair enough.

403
00:16:49,458 --> 00:16:52,375
Sorry, I just haven't seen you dickheads
in so long,

404
00:16:52,458 --> 00:16:54,083
it was a natural reaction.

405
00:16:54,166 --> 00:16:55,208
I'll process this.

406
00:16:55,291 --> 00:16:57,750
-Thank you.
-As soon as I see the fucking body.

407
00:16:57,833 --> 00:16:59,958
Absolutely.
Whatever you need to do, Fucknel.

408
00:17:00,041 --> 00:17:02,625
He's laid out
at the funeral home right now, dead.

409
00:17:02,708 --> 00:17:04,583
Holy fuck, you're shitting me!

410
00:17:05,458 --> 00:17:09,291
Yep, there he is. Poor Ricky.
Not an ounce of life left in him.

411
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:11,458
Wow, goddamn. He's dead as fuck.

412
00:17:11,541 --> 00:17:13,583
Okay, you saw the body.
You done fucking with us now?

413
00:17:13,666 --> 00:17:15,916
Yeah, sure. All checks out. We're good.

414
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,958
Oh, when's the funeral?

415
00:17:18,041 --> 00:17:18,958
Funeral?

416
00:17:19,041 --> 00:17:21,833
Uh, we're just still trying to sort out…

417
00:17:21,916 --> 00:17:23,875
It's gonna be first thing
tomorrow morning.

418
00:17:23,958 --> 00:17:25,291
Okay, good, terrific.

419
00:17:25,375 --> 00:17:27,708
I'd really love to come by
and pay my respects.

420
00:17:27,791 --> 00:17:29,666
I'll see you guys in the morning, eh?

421
00:17:30,666 --> 00:17:32,375
Fuck! This is just great, Julian.

422
00:17:32,458 --> 00:17:35,500
-Now we have to do a fucking funeral?
-It's okay. Calm down.

423
00:17:36,041 --> 00:17:38,708
We'll do a little setup at the graveyard,
wait for him to show up,

424
00:17:38,791 --> 00:17:41,166
he'll see that it's real,
and then he'll fuck off, okay?

425
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:42,750
-It's easy.
-Jesus Murphy!

426
00:17:42,833 --> 00:17:44,458
How in the fuck did we get here?

427
00:17:44,541 --> 00:17:46,875
Dead bodies and fake funerals
and... fuck!

428
00:17:48,166 --> 00:17:49,583
Okay, listen up, everyone.

429
00:17:49,666 --> 00:17:51,541
I need you all to pretend to be sad.

430
00:17:51,625 --> 00:17:54,041
And let's not get carried away.
This needs to feel real.

431
00:17:54,125 --> 00:17:56,916
No worries, dawg.
We got this acting shit to a tee.

432
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,541
I even got my 40 with me,
so I can pour some out for the homie.

433
00:17:59,958 --> 00:18:01,041
It's all good, dawg.

434
00:18:01,125 --> 00:18:03,833
Yeah, we got this, no problem.
What kind of crying you want?

435
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:07,041
I got Nick Cage shit.
He's all like, "Why?"

436
00:18:07,125 --> 00:18:10,083
Or do you want <i>Old Yeller-</i>type shit,
when they were taking out that dog?

437
00:18:10,166 --> 00:18:12,083
'Cause I cried hard,
and that was for real.

438
00:18:12,166 --> 00:18:15,666
That was like,
"What? Why did you do that? Why?"

439
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:17,458
Fuck, Cory. Just be normal.

440
00:18:17,541 --> 00:18:19,375
Less is more, everybody.

441
00:18:19,458 --> 00:18:21,625
Jacob, what in the fuck are you doing?

442
00:18:21,708 --> 00:18:24,458
I'm making my eyes smell onions.
It makes them cry.

443
00:18:24,541 --> 00:18:26,541
Where in the Christ is Fucknel at?

444
00:18:26,625 --> 00:18:29,000
The zombie drug's
gonna start wearing off here.

445
00:18:29,083 --> 00:18:30,291
Bates, how we doing on time?

446
00:18:30,708 --> 00:18:31,916
We are getting close.

447
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,000
In truth,
I've never had to take it this far before.

448
00:18:35,083 --> 00:18:36,333
[laughs]

449
00:18:36,416 --> 00:18:37,583
Yo, they here!

450
00:18:37,666 --> 00:18:39,250
It's showtime, motherfuckers.

451
00:18:39,333 --> 00:18:41,166
Get your sad on. Get it on!

452
00:18:44,833 --> 00:18:47,458
Okay, Julian.
Looks like this is really happening.

453
00:18:49,833 --> 00:18:51,541
I can't wait to hear the service.

454
00:18:51,625 --> 00:18:54,416
I fucking love a funeral service.
 I'm sure it'll be very nice.

455
00:18:55,708 --> 00:18:57,500
You're just in time.
We were about to start.

456
00:18:58,166 --> 00:19:01,041
[Julian] Afternoon, everyone.
Today, we honor Ricky.

457
00:19:01,916 --> 00:19:04,833
Sure, he was fucked up,
but deep down, he was a great guy

458
00:19:04,916 --> 00:19:06,791
and one of my best friends.

459
00:19:06,875 --> 00:19:10,125
Anyway, he didn't want a long funeral,
so thank you all for coming.

460
00:19:10,208 --> 00:19:12,958
Hold it. Ricky was my second best friend.
I need to say something.

461
00:19:13,583 --> 00:19:15,208
-Cory!
-Sorry, no time, Cory.

462
00:19:15,291 --> 00:19:17,541
Let the man pay his respects.
Jesus Christ!

463
00:19:18,458 --> 00:19:20,625
Uh. [clears throat]

464
00:19:21,458 --> 00:19:25,000
Well, Ricky was like my friend,
even though he never called me that.

465
00:19:25,083 --> 00:19:28,666
But he had a big heart,
and I really care for him.

466
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:30,708
And whenever he'd say, "Shut up, Cory,"

467
00:19:30,791 --> 00:19:33,291
I knew
it was because he was listening to me.

468
00:19:33,375 --> 00:19:34,666
And, you know, I just…

469
00:19:35,291 --> 00:19:36,250
Why?

470
00:19:36,791 --> 00:19:38,333
Oh, why?

471
00:19:38,458 --> 00:19:40,375
Okay, thank you, everybody.
Please get home safe.

472
00:19:40,833 --> 00:19:44,166
Wait, what about the part
where you fucking bury him in the ground?

473
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:46,000
That's what you do with dead people,
right?

474
00:19:46,416 --> 00:19:48,791
Yeah, that's true.
That's where the deadies go.

475
00:19:49,958 --> 00:19:51,916
Fucking, so...

476
00:19:54,875 --> 00:19:56,291
[casket rattling]

477
00:19:56,375 --> 00:20:00,750
I know you're all really upset here,
so the least I can do is give you a hand.

478
00:20:00,833 --> 00:20:02,958
Like I said, I fucking love a funeral.

479
00:20:03,041 --> 00:20:05,333
All right, everybody grab a shovel.

480
00:20:05,416 --> 00:20:07,416
-What?
-Grab a fucking shovel, Bubs.

481
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:09,541
[digging]

482
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:12,750
-[dirt scattering]
-[shovels patting]

483
00:20:12,833 --> 00:20:15,666
Julian, we're running out of time here.

484
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:18,375
Okay, that's it. Thanks, Fucknel.
We'll take it from here.

485
00:20:18,458 --> 00:20:22,291
Look, gang, I apologize.
I thought you guys were fucking with me.

486
00:20:22,375 --> 00:20:25,708
We're not, so we'd like to go back
to the fucking park and mourn in peace.

487
00:20:25,791 --> 00:20:28,166
Jesus, I feel kind of bad now.

488
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:31,083
Ricky was a cunt, but a respectable cunt.

489
00:20:31,166 --> 00:20:33,250
-Sorry for your loss.
-Thanks, man.

490
00:20:33,333 --> 00:20:37,250
-You know, thinking back to those days...
-Oh, for the love of fuck!

491
00:20:37,333 --> 00:20:39,583
…there were a lot of times
I beat the shit out of you

492
00:20:39,666 --> 00:20:41,458
when maybe I didn't really have to.

493
00:20:41,541 --> 00:20:44,541
[whispering] He's gonna start reminiscing.
You gotta stop him.

494
00:20:44,625 --> 00:20:46,875
There's that time
I fucking pushed you off the bridge

495
00:20:46,958 --> 00:20:49,000
and threw a bunch of your cats in
after you.

496
00:20:49,083 --> 00:20:51,666
Yeah, I remember that,
but maybe now is not the time.

497
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:54,958
And the time I put you in the garbage can
upside down and pissed on you.

498
00:20:55,041 --> 00:20:56,416
That was probably a bit much.

499
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:58,875
That's great,
but we gotta get the fuck out of here now.

500
00:20:58,958 --> 00:21:00,875
Hold your horses there, Pontiac.

501
00:21:00,958 --> 00:21:02,416
Ticktock, Julian.

502
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:06,458
I never thought I'd feel bad for Ricky,
and for you guys and your loss.

503
00:21:06,541 --> 00:21:08,333
Oh, my fuck, it's Ricky calling!

504
00:21:09,375 --> 00:21:11,375
[softly] Ricky! Holy fuck, are you okay?

505
00:21:11,458 --> 00:21:13,750
<i>Yeah, but I can't get</i>
<i>this fucking thing open!</i>

506
00:21:13,833 --> 00:21:14,833
<i>Do you have it locked?</i>

507
00:21:14,916 --> 00:21:16,500
Okay, just listen, Ricky.

508
00:21:16,583 --> 00:21:17,958
Don't freak out, but...

509
00:21:18,833 --> 00:21:21,541
you're buried six feet
under the fucking dirt in a graveyard.

510
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,916
<i>What? Oh, for fuck's sakes.</i>
<i>So, I got dead?</i>

511
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,083
No, you're not dead, Ricky.

512
00:21:27,166 --> 00:21:28,458
Just stay calm.

513
00:21:28,541 --> 00:21:29,375
Oh, boy.

514
00:21:29,458 --> 00:21:32,916
Julian, Eagle One is okay,
but we gotta move, pronto!

515
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,625
Okay, Fucknel, we're done here.

516
00:21:34,708 --> 00:21:36,958
There's serious family shit
to deal with back at the park,

517
00:21:37,041 --> 00:21:38,333
and you're not family.

518
00:21:38,416 --> 00:21:39,500
Alright, then.

519
00:21:39,583 --> 00:21:40,875
You know what? Fuck you!

520
00:21:40,958 --> 00:21:43,208
Just trying to show
a little fucking respect.

521
00:21:43,291 --> 00:21:44,916
Jesus. Let's go, boys.

522
00:21:46,041 --> 00:21:47,875
Alright, everyone,
let's dig him the fuck out!

523
00:21:47,958 --> 00:21:49,708
Shovels, your bare hands,
I don't give a fuck!

524
00:21:49,791 --> 00:21:51,083
Let's get him out of there!

525
00:21:51,166 --> 00:21:53,875
We're digging you out now.
Tell me you're still okay!

526
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:56,500
<i>Yeah, I'm lighting a joint</i>
<i>to calm my nerves.</i>

527
00:21:56,583 --> 00:21:58,750
No, don't fucking light anything!

528
00:21:58,833 --> 00:22:01,125
It'll burn up
what little oxygen you have in there!

529
00:22:01,208 --> 00:22:04,916
Help dig! Don't worry about his oxygen
right now! His brain doesn't need much!

530
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,583
Ricky, just hold on, bud!

531
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:09,000
Ricky!

532
00:22:09,083 --> 00:22:11,250
-Oh, my fuck, he's not responding!
-Fuck!

533
00:22:11,333 --> 00:22:12,666
Hey, he could be on another call.

534
00:22:13,333 --> 00:22:14,916
We hit it. We're at the casket.

535
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,250
Get back, everybody!

536
00:22:16,333 --> 00:22:18,291
[casket clattering]

537
00:22:18,375 --> 00:22:21,541
[Bubbles] Oh, my God, he's gone!
Oh, my fuck, we killed him!

538
00:22:21,625 --> 00:22:22,833
[Bubbles] We killed Ricky!

539
00:22:23,458 --> 00:22:24,375
The plot thickens.

540
00:22:24,458 --> 00:22:26,958
Yo, I got this!
I've seen this in a movie. Back up!

541
00:22:27,041 --> 00:22:31,458
No, Cory, just-- It's gotta be precise!
Oh, you missed his heart!

542
00:22:31,541 --> 00:22:32,416
[Cory] Oh, shit, dude.

543
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:35,708
-[exhales] Hey! What's up, boys?
-[celestial music playing]

544
00:22:35,791 --> 00:22:37,541
-[all] Yes! Ricky!

545
00:22:37,625 --> 00:22:38,791
You're alive!

546
00:22:38,875 --> 00:22:41,000
[laughing] Who's got your belly?

547
00:22:41,083 --> 00:22:44,333
I think this was
the craziest few days of my life, boys.

548
00:22:44,416 --> 00:22:46,875
I know. Being dead as a doorbell
and then coming back to life?

549
00:22:46,958 --> 00:22:47,958
How crazy is that?

550
00:22:48,041 --> 00:22:50,166
Well, you weren't actually dead, Ricky.

551
00:22:50,250 --> 00:22:53,625
Tell that to the angels that flew down
and tickled my balls with their wings.

552
00:22:53,708 --> 00:22:57,250
What? Ricky, you were hallucinating
from lack of oxygen.

553
00:22:57,333 --> 00:22:59,500
You didn't actually have
little angels down there

554
00:22:59,583 --> 00:23:01,625
tickling your fucking balls
with their wings.

555
00:23:01,708 --> 00:23:03,458
It sucks, though.
We had all that money,

556
00:23:03,541 --> 00:23:05,458
and now we have nothing
for to show for it.

557
00:23:05,541 --> 00:23:08,458
That isn't 100 percent true.
Check this out, boys.

558
00:23:08,541 --> 00:23:10,875
Oh, wow! Shitty wine.

559
00:23:10,958 --> 00:23:12,333
No, it's not shitty wine.

560
00:23:12,416 --> 00:23:15,166
I poured the Black Tot rum in this fucker
before the bank could take it.

561
00:23:15,250 --> 00:23:16,166
No way!

562
00:23:16,250 --> 00:23:18,875
-What? That's the Black Tot?
-Yes, it is.

563
00:23:18,958 --> 00:23:20,208
Okay, boys.

564
00:23:20,291 --> 00:23:21,500
Toast to my old man.

565
00:23:21,583 --> 00:23:23,583
-Here's to your old man.
-To the old man.

566
00:23:23,666 --> 00:23:26,875
-And for Ricky not being dead.
-Yeah, I'll fucking drink to that.

567
00:23:26,958 --> 00:23:27,916
[Bubbles laughs]

568
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,416
Holy fuck, boys! I just gunned down
200 dollars worth of rum.

569
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:32,708
Never did that before!

570
00:23:32,791 --> 00:23:35,500
Holy fuck!
Guess what my brain just got said?

571
00:23:35,583 --> 00:23:37,458
I just realized I can do
whatever the fuck I want

572
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:39,875
for the rest of my life,
'cause everyone thinks I'm dead!

573
00:23:39,958 --> 00:23:41,208
Oh, boy.

574
00:23:41,291 --> 00:23:43,291
[piano theme music playing]

575
00:24:44,458 --> 00:24:46,458
[seagulls cawing]

576
00:24:46,541 --> 00:24:48,541
[waves splashing]

577
00:24:48,625 --> 00:24:50,625
[engine chugging]

578
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:05,416
[voices] Oh, fuck.

579
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:06,916
[man] Jesus Christ!

580
00:25:07,250 --> 00:25:11,916
[whooshing]

581
00:25:12,916 --> 00:25:15,166
[man whispers] <i>Fuck off.</i>

1
00:00:07,137 --> 00:00:09,337
- Who's my little pussycat?

2
00:00:09,344 --> 00:00:10,624
Grab my dipstick.

3
00:00:10,625 --> 00:00:12,030
Let me give you some oil.

4
00:00:12,034 --> 00:00:13,481
- My tail came off!

5
00:00:15,034 --> 00:00:16,240
Who's a bad boy who

6
00:00:16,241 --> 00:00:17,171
ripped off my tail?
- Who's my

7
00:00:17,172 --> 00:00:19,212
little pussycat?
- Oh, yeah.

8
00:00:28,103 --> 00:00:29,274
Oh, fuck!

9
00:00:33,551 --> 00:00:34,829
- Oh, fuck that's hot.

10
00:00:36,758 --> 00:00:37,548
Molly?

11
00:00:39,172 --> 00:00:40,205
Hi!

12
00:00:40,206 --> 00:00:41,756
Hi, hi, hi, hi, hi!

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,410
So sorry.

14
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:48,860
- You look like a lion.

15
00:00:48,862 --> 00:00:49,692
- It's a cheetah.

16
00:00:49,693 --> 00:00:50,789
- What?

17
00:00:50,793 --> 00:00:51,593
- Nothing.

18
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:55,690
- Ad agency having
a Halloween party?

19
00:00:56,827 --> 00:00:58,857
- Long story, I slept in a van.

20
00:00:58,862 --> 00:01:00,378
- Uh...

21
00:01:00,379 --> 00:01:01,479
- It's a new client,

22
00:01:04,517 --> 00:01:07,787
loves imported vans circa 1966,

23
00:01:07,793 --> 00:01:09,553
and is a furry,

24
00:01:10,827 --> 00:01:14,585
but hey, I got the new
oil and gas accounts,

25
00:01:14,586 --> 00:01:16,516
and the agency's
about to make bank,

26
00:01:16,517 --> 00:01:18,447
and, you know, mom texted me

27
00:01:18,448 --> 00:01:20,548
that my dad moved into
the guest bedroom.

28
00:01:20,551 --> 00:01:21,964
- How are you doing?

29
00:01:21,965 --> 00:01:22,995
- Oh, I'm fine!

30
00:01:27,655 --> 00:01:30,785
They're both due for a mid life
crisis, they'll work it out.

31
00:01:30,793 --> 00:01:32,003
- What is with baby boomers

32
00:01:32,004 --> 00:01:35,205
texting about
massive life events?

33
00:01:35,206 --> 00:01:37,585
It's like it took them so
long to learn how to text,

34
00:01:37,586 --> 00:01:38,826
they forgot how to call.

35
00:01:38,827 --> 00:01:40,274
- Oh, yeah.

36
00:01:40,275 --> 00:01:43,375
"Aunt Alma died, angel emoji,
coffin emoji, cry face."

37
00:01:44,724 --> 00:01:46,861
So is that all you
brought, or what?

38
00:01:46,862 --> 00:01:48,660
- There wasn't a third
seat in the moving van,

39
00:01:48,661 --> 00:01:49,855
my parents are
bringing the rest.

40
00:01:49,862 --> 00:01:51,032
- Oh, such good parents.

41
00:01:51,034 --> 00:01:52,516
- They insisted.

42
00:01:52,517 --> 00:01:55,067
Staying with them for
one week was my limit.

43
00:01:55,068 --> 00:01:57,308
- You've been here for a week?

44
00:01:57,310 --> 00:01:59,860
- The placement
came up so quickly,

45
00:01:59,862 --> 00:02:01,452
I was back here
before I knew it.

46
00:02:02,896 --> 00:02:05,964
I just wasn't very good
at staying in touch

47
00:02:05,965 --> 00:02:09,475
and I didn't know if
you'd still want me here.

48
00:02:09,482 --> 00:02:12,342
- I didn't even try to rent
your room, I hate everyone else.

49
00:02:13,517 --> 00:02:17,097
- I am really sorry.

50
00:02:17,103 --> 00:02:18,516
I really am!

51
00:02:18,517 --> 00:02:19,687
- Shush!

52
00:02:19,689 --> 00:02:21,099
Shush, shush,
shush, shush, shush.

53
00:02:21,103 --> 00:02:21,931
Okay, I wanna hear everything,
tell me about your job.

54
00:02:21,932 --> 00:02:22,931
Did you meet a guy?

55
00:02:22,932 --> 00:02:24,411
Fucking love a British accent.

56
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,240
- Um...

57
00:02:31,103 --> 00:02:33,313
- If anybody hurts you,

58
00:02:34,793 --> 00:02:38,481
I will rip there head off
and shit down their neck.

59
00:02:39,453 --> 00:02:40,858
Do you know what I mean?

60
00:02:40,862 --> 00:02:42,412
- That's the most
beautiful thing

61
00:02:42,413 --> 00:02:43,833
anybody has ever said to me.

62
00:02:45,931 --> 00:02:47,205
Nothing serious.

63
00:02:47,206 --> 00:02:49,236
- Sweet, wingwoman's
back in town, then.

64
00:02:51,905 --> 00:02:52,926
Frankie!

65
00:02:52,931 --> 00:02:54,341
- Hey, dad.

66
00:02:54,344 --> 00:02:55,412
- Hey, honey.

67
00:02:55,413 --> 00:02:58,757
- Hi.

68
00:02:58,758 --> 00:03:00,618
- Elle, nice to see ya.

69
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:02,516
- Costume party.

70
00:03:02,517 --> 00:03:05,027
- Reminds me when the
two of you where younger.

71
00:03:05,034 --> 00:03:06,723
Thanks for taking
the old doggy in.

72
00:03:06,724 --> 00:03:08,624
- I mean, I am paying rent.

73
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,930
- Moll, your grandma wants
you to have this lamp.

74
00:03:14,965 --> 00:03:16,995
Have you called her
since you've been back?

75
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,516
- Yup, had a light convo
about my eggs drying up,

76
00:03:20,517 --> 00:03:23,377
followed by what a tragedy it is

77
00:03:23,379 --> 00:03:24,999
that I don't have a
boyfriend anymore,

78
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,516
ending in how I
need to marry rich.

79
00:03:27,517 --> 00:03:29,407
- Sounds reasonable.

80
00:03:29,413 --> 00:03:31,210
- Huh, works.
- Where's Meredith?

81
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:33,446
- She's grabbing
her power tools.

82
00:03:33,448 --> 00:03:34,898
Aww, my little beef cake.

83
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,030
- Okay, keys.

84
00:03:40,034 --> 00:03:41,554
I'm gonna go shower before work.

85
00:03:41,555 --> 00:03:42,757
Rosie's, 5:00pm.

86
00:03:42,758 --> 00:03:43,898
Don't be late, I
know where you live.

87
00:03:43,899 --> 00:03:44,926
- Hey,

88
00:03:44,931 --> 00:03:46,274
thank you.

89
00:03:46,275 --> 00:03:47,895
- Fucking good to have you back.

90
00:03:51,068 --> 00:03:52,478
- She's got a tail.

91
00:03:52,482 --> 00:03:53,688
- Yeah, she does.

92
00:03:53,689 --> 00:03:54,689
Go get mom.

93
00:03:54,690 --> 00:03:56,378
- Okay.

94
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,100
- Perv.

95
00:04:24,103 --> 00:04:25,343
Hey!

96
00:04:25,344 --> 00:04:27,244
How come no one told me
you were coming back?

97
00:04:27,245 --> 00:04:28,964
- Rosie, your pregnant?

98
00:04:28,965 --> 00:04:29,785
What?

99
00:04:29,793 --> 00:04:30,723
Who?

100
00:04:31,793 --> 00:04:33,792
- The science, ball and chain.

101
00:04:33,793 --> 00:04:35,792
I mean, if you ever
replied to my text messages

102
00:04:35,793 --> 00:04:36,903
you might know that.

103
00:04:36,904 --> 00:04:37,926
- I--

104
00:04:37,931 --> 00:04:39,621
- Ah, look who we found, right?

105
00:04:39,622 --> 00:04:41,378
- Gang's back together, huh?

106
00:04:41,379 --> 00:04:42,209
What are you drinking?

107
00:04:43,482 --> 00:04:45,830
- So are you just here
for a visit, or what?

108
00:04:45,831 --> 00:04:48,207
- Nope, I just had to
move across an ocean

109
00:04:48,208 --> 00:04:49,756
to find anyone to
give me experience,

110
00:04:49,758 --> 00:04:52,098
to get a permanent teaching
job right back here.

111
00:04:52,103 --> 00:04:54,313
- Huh, you want to be
teaching here, huh?

112
00:04:54,314 --> 00:04:55,516
- Uh-huh.

113
00:04:55,517 --> 00:04:56,757
- Hmm, have you read
the news lately?

114
00:05:00,068 --> 00:05:01,585
- Woof.

115
00:05:01,586 --> 00:05:02,786
Your school have to deal
with any of that bullshit?

116
00:05:02,793 --> 00:05:03,833
- Well, we have to
follow the curriculum,

117
00:05:03,834 --> 00:05:05,377
but I don't teach sex ed.

118
00:05:06,517 --> 00:05:07,447
- That's a shame,

119
00:05:07,448 --> 00:05:08,548
fucked up the best subject.

120
00:05:09,827 --> 00:05:11,277
- You managed to learn
just fine, didn't you?

121
00:05:11,278 --> 00:05:12,475
I sure did.

122
00:05:12,482 --> 00:05:15,032
- All right, enough about work.

123
00:05:15,034 --> 00:05:16,378
Tell us everything.

124
00:05:33,034 --> 00:05:35,136
- Hey, guys, I am still missing

125
00:05:35,137 --> 00:05:37,097
three reports from last week.

126
00:05:37,103 --> 00:05:38,826
I want them tomorrow.

127
00:05:38,827 --> 00:05:39,617
Two.

128
00:05:45,241 --> 00:05:46,411
- Mrs. Phillips?

129
00:05:46,413 --> 00:05:47,930
- Mm-hmm?

130
00:05:47,931 --> 00:05:49,311
- I know where not suppose
to talk about this anymore,

131
00:05:49,312 --> 00:05:51,790
but I saw this photo.

132
00:05:53,137 --> 00:05:53,997
Is this you?

133
00:05:55,965 --> 00:05:57,785
- You're gonna miss
your bus, Sarah.

134
00:06:26,034 --> 00:06:27,757
- Well, hi, baby.

135
00:06:27,758 --> 00:06:29,516
- Are you busy?

136
00:06:29,517 --> 00:06:34,407
- Well, I was suppose to
meet my mom, but whatever,

137
00:06:34,413 --> 00:06:35,654
I do what I want.

138
00:06:35,655 --> 00:06:37,685
- I really need to talk to you.

139
00:06:37,689 --> 00:06:39,757
So when I was in England--

140
00:06:39,758 --> 00:06:42,168
- Rosie's, give me 30 minutes.

141
00:06:52,344 --> 00:06:53,585
- There you go, handsome.

142
00:06:53,586 --> 00:06:54,826
- Just gotta pee,
I'll be right back.

143
00:06:54,827 --> 00:06:56,097
- Okay, babe, I'll
get you a drink.

144
00:06:57,379 --> 00:06:59,099
- Hello, what can I get ya?

145
00:06:59,103 --> 00:07:00,143
- I don't know you.

146
00:07:01,758 --> 00:07:06,585
- I'm Jake, I'm a human
man, also a bartender.

147
00:07:06,586 --> 00:07:08,406
This is Rosie's, it's a bar.

148
00:07:08,413 --> 00:07:09,313
- Where is Rosie?

149
00:07:09,314 --> 00:07:10,895
You work here?

150
00:07:10,896 --> 00:07:14,376
- Well, technically my band
plays here on the weekends.

151
00:07:14,379 --> 00:07:15,479
Maybe you've seen us?

152
00:07:15,482 --> 00:07:16,585
Nerdgasm?

153
00:07:16,586 --> 00:07:17,686
No?

154
00:07:17,689 --> 00:07:18,519
Or not.

155
00:07:19,724 --> 00:07:21,761
Yes, yes, I am
helping Rosie out.

156
00:07:21,762 --> 00:07:23,654
- Okay, well, you
don't know my drink.

157
00:07:23,655 --> 00:07:24,755
- Well, I can make anything.

158
00:07:24,758 --> 00:07:25,998
- No, thank you.

159
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,790
- Jake, I got this monster.

160
00:07:27,793 --> 00:07:29,102
- Do you know how a bar works?

161
00:07:29,103 --> 00:07:30,143
Do you know how it works?
- Oh, yeah.

162
00:07:30,144 --> 00:07:31,237
- Okay, just checking.

163
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:33,550
- Don't do that again.

164
00:07:33,551 --> 00:07:35,550
- Do you want me to give
birth behind this bar?

165
00:07:35,551 --> 00:07:36,999
- When in Rome.

166
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,790
- That's not what that means.

167
00:07:38,793 --> 00:07:39,999
- Well, it is now.

168
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,240
- Where were we.

169
00:07:41,241 --> 00:07:44,721
- Oh, well, right
where we left off.

170
00:07:44,724 --> 00:07:46,516
Nope, nope, nope.

171
00:07:46,517 --> 00:07:47,337
Ugh, no.

172
00:07:48,275 --> 00:07:49,205
Ooh!

173
00:07:49,206 --> 00:07:50,136
He could be here in 10 minutes.

174
00:07:50,137 --> 00:07:51,826
- Stop ordering penis Uber.

175
00:07:51,827 --> 00:07:53,097
Puber.

176
00:07:53,103 --> 00:07:54,826
- One for me, and one for you.

177
00:07:54,827 --> 00:07:55,787
It's like you never left.

178
00:07:55,793 --> 00:07:56,723
- No, stop!

179
00:07:56,724 --> 00:07:57,792
Um...

180
00:07:57,793 --> 00:07:58,999
- Hey!

181
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,550
Oh, you swiped
left, I liked him.

182
00:08:00,551 --> 00:08:01,999
- I'm not single.

183
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,968
I am in a monogamous, exclusive,
long-distance relationship

184
00:08:05,969 --> 00:08:08,235
that makes absolutely
no logical sense at all,

185
00:08:08,241 --> 00:08:09,619
but I am in it.

186
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:11,550
- What, why didn't
you tell me about him?

187
00:08:11,551 --> 00:08:13,721
- Her, with a woman.

188
00:08:15,965 --> 00:08:16,785
- What?

189
00:08:16,793 --> 00:08:17,833
Since, wait...

190
00:08:18,793 --> 00:08:19,623
Are you?

191
00:08:19,624 --> 00:08:21,140
- I'm just Molly.

192
00:08:24,551 --> 00:08:25,381
- Hey!

193
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:28,757
Oh my God, I love you!

194
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:30,858
- You're the first person
I've told, actually.

195
00:08:30,862 --> 00:08:35,309
Nobody knows yet, except my
entire school, apparently.

196
00:08:35,310 --> 00:08:37,100
Guess I have to tell my parents.

197
00:08:37,103 --> 00:08:38,551
- Oh my God, they're
so chill, though.

198
00:08:38,552 --> 00:08:40,031
I'm pretty sure
your mom gave my mom

199
00:08:40,034 --> 00:08:41,382
her first vibrator in the 70's.

200
00:08:41,383 --> 00:08:42,619
I found it when I was a kid,

201
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:44,790
and I thought it was
a microphone and--

202
00:08:46,241 --> 00:08:47,721
I'm so sorry, this is about you.

203
00:08:47,724 --> 00:08:51,214
- Just, like, my mom has
only ever been with my Dad,

204
00:08:51,215 --> 00:08:54,306
and I don't want to
say 'sex' at her face.

205
00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:55,860
"Hey, mom, I'm bi-sex-"

206
00:08:55,862 --> 00:08:57,001
We we need a new word.

207
00:08:57,002 --> 00:08:59,240
- Yeah, cool, so
we'll spin it, right?

208
00:08:59,241 --> 00:09:01,826
Um, pansex-, oh, that's...

209
00:09:01,827 --> 00:09:02,757
Nope.

210
00:09:02,758 --> 00:09:04,168
Dualectual.

211
00:09:04,172 --> 00:09:05,412
Flexual!

212
00:09:05,413 --> 00:09:06,930
Fluid.

213
00:09:06,931 --> 00:09:08,999
- I don't want to talk to my
parents about fluids, either.

214
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
- That's fair.

215
00:09:13,206 --> 00:09:15,066
May I buy you dinner m'lady?

216
00:09:15,068 --> 00:09:16,998
- Did you really just m'lady me?

217
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,790
- I did my lady
you, come with me.

218
00:09:18,793 --> 00:09:19,999
- I'll take the dinner.

219
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,380
- Where going to
the medieval fair.

220
00:09:23,275 --> 00:09:24,095
- Thank you, Rosie!

221
00:09:24,103 --> 00:09:24,973
- Bye, Rosie.

222
00:09:26,137 --> 00:09:27,826
- Bye, guy I never
want to see again.

223
00:09:27,827 --> 00:09:29,477
- It's Jake.

224
00:09:36,034 --> 00:09:38,724
- Hey, isn't that your mom?

225
00:09:42,586 --> 00:09:43,516
- No.

226
00:09:43,517 --> 00:09:44,787
No.

227
00:09:44,793 --> 00:09:45,723
No.
- Elle!

228
00:09:49,206 --> 00:09:50,716
- Hey, Patricia.

229
00:09:56,379 --> 00:09:57,589
- That's my daughter.

230
00:09:57,590 --> 00:09:59,654
- That's your daughter?

231
00:10:25,586 --> 00:10:28,274
- Oh!

232
00:10:34,275 --> 00:10:37,205
- Ugh!

233
00:10:38,862 --> 00:10:39,662
What?

234
00:10:42,344 --> 00:10:43,694
- You didn't know?

235
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:48,205
- Oh my God.

236
00:10:48,206 --> 00:10:50,136
- I'm so sorry, my mom told me.

237
00:10:50,137 --> 00:10:50,967
- You knew?

238
00:10:59,172 --> 00:11:00,792
Are they fucking?

239
00:11:00,793 --> 00:11:01,593
- Very probably.

240
00:11:06,310 --> 00:11:07,760
- What do you need right now?

241
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:09,860
No!

242
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:19,174
- This.

243
00:11:23,034 --> 00:11:23,934
And this.

244
00:11:25,689 --> 00:11:26,999
- Share.

245
00:11:30,310 --> 00:11:31,619
Oh, God, that's
fucking terrible!

246
00:11:38,344 --> 00:11:40,764
- I'm really glad your here.

247
00:11:43,034 --> 00:11:43,864
- Me too.

1
00:00:44,448 --> 00:00:49,408
♪ Nothing's ever
gonna be the same ♪

2
00:00:52,137 --> 00:00:56,277
♪ I don't know how
to communicate ♪

3
00:01:00,103 --> 00:01:01,830
- It's still morning, right?

4
00:01:01,831 --> 00:01:04,136
- Hey, people drink
mimosas in the morning.

5
00:01:04,137 --> 00:01:05,307
- That's straight vodka.

6
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:06,550
- With a little

7
00:01:06,551 --> 00:01:07,721
splash of vermouth.
- Splash of vermouth.

8
00:01:07,724 --> 00:01:09,212
Yeah, yeah, all right.
- That's right.

9
00:01:09,213 --> 00:01:10,166
- I'll saddle up.

10
00:01:10,172 --> 00:01:12,688
One of those.
- All right.

11
00:01:12,689 --> 00:01:13,519
- Hi.

12
00:01:16,137 --> 00:01:20,477
So tell me, Dad, I'm 30.

13
00:01:20,482 --> 00:01:21,757
- You're 33.

14
00:01:21,758 --> 00:01:24,928
- Three, thank you
for that reminder.

15
00:01:24,931 --> 00:01:26,101
- But you're still my
little girl though.

16
00:01:26,103 --> 00:01:28,863
- Oh my god, Dad, stop.

17
00:01:30,379 --> 00:01:31,757
Thank you, Rosie.

18
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:34,895
Oh, more olives for
Dad, that's great.

19
00:01:34,896 --> 00:01:35,966
- Mm-hmm, that's my breakfast.

20
00:01:37,827 --> 00:01:38,655
- I know you know,

21
00:01:38,656 --> 00:01:39,475
all of it.

22
00:01:44,137 --> 00:01:47,377
- I wasn't expecting
to be single at 55.

23
00:01:49,413 --> 00:01:54,383
I thought, okay, so I
work and I raise a kid

24
00:01:55,827 --> 00:01:59,377
and I retire, move to
the Riviera or something.

25
00:01:59,379 --> 00:02:00,379
- You're moving?

26
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:02,205
- You know that commercial

27
00:02:02,206 --> 00:02:04,096
with that retired
couple on that boat?

28
00:02:05,448 --> 00:02:10,448
And there's a sunset,
and forever love right?

29
00:02:11,172 --> 00:02:12,688
Yeah, my saggy ass.

30
00:02:12,689 --> 00:02:17,516
- Dad, that's advertising no
one actually retires like that.

31
00:02:17,517 --> 00:02:19,897
- Good, you know what,
then it's her fault okay?

32
00:02:19,898 --> 00:02:23,996
She too good at her job selling
lies and emotional torture.

33
00:02:25,862 --> 00:02:30,862
I have nothing now, okay?
- Okay, you have me I'm here

34
00:02:31,448 --> 00:02:32,208
yes, of course.

35
00:02:33,655 --> 00:02:35,825
- I'm sure if you guys just
go to therapy or whatever

36
00:02:35,827 --> 00:02:37,277
you probably just
need some space.

37
00:02:37,278 --> 00:02:41,025
- I thought I was her
younger guy, he's your age

38
00:02:41,034 --> 00:02:43,214
didn't see that coming.

39
00:02:45,103 --> 00:02:49,964
Just the thought of him
holding her and kissing her

40
00:02:49,965 --> 00:02:52,065
and putting his big
- nope

41
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:54,550
arms

42
00:02:54,551 --> 00:02:55,721
around her, I need
another olive.

43
00:02:55,724 --> 00:02:56,524
- Okay

44
00:03:00,068 --> 00:03:02,067
- I know that I'm not
young and exciting anymore

45
00:03:02,068 --> 00:03:05,338
I just thought that was
the point, that's the point

46
00:03:05,344 --> 00:03:08,447
you hold each other,
until you grow old.

47
00:03:08,448 --> 00:03:12,338
- Dad, I'll talk to her okay?

48
00:03:12,344 --> 00:03:13,826
I'll talk to her.

49
00:03:13,827 --> 00:03:18,167
- No you know what, you're
right I need some space okay?

50
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:22,309
I'm going to the cottage,
cottages are predictable

51
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:25,340
walls, that's what I need.

52
00:03:25,344 --> 00:03:27,144
I need to think
about me for awhile.

53
00:03:28,413 --> 00:03:30,863
You call me if you want
to get in touch with me.

54
00:03:30,864 --> 00:03:33,171
How much is an Uber
to Muskoka anyway?

55
00:03:33,172 --> 00:03:35,102
- That's a strange
way to get there

56
00:03:35,103 --> 00:03:37,136
- I don't have my glasses.

57
00:03:37,137 --> 00:03:39,997
Hello Uber, come to me Uber

58
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,280
- Dad there's an app, you
have to download the app.

59
00:03:48,793 --> 00:03:50,693
- Please come to
administration, we need you

60
00:03:50,694 --> 00:03:52,239
to cover a class.

61
00:03:54,482 --> 00:03:58,378
What the fuck.

62
00:04:24,862 --> 00:04:27,592
hey guys, I know we would
rather be throwing balls

63
00:04:27,593 --> 00:04:31,026
but we need to cover sex ED

64
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,380
sexual education.

65
00:04:37,551 --> 00:04:39,761
We have to do that now.

66
00:04:39,762 --> 00:04:44,758
I'm sorry, I'm not your usual
teacher, but we can do this.

67
00:04:47,551 --> 00:04:52,551
So, we're gonna start by
talking about our self concepts

68
00:04:53,965 --> 00:04:57,065
a lot of things influence
how we think about ourselves.

69
00:04:57,068 --> 00:05:01,205
From sexual orientation,
does everybody know

70
00:05:01,206 --> 00:05:02,716
what that means?

71
00:05:02,724 --> 00:05:07,136
To gender identity, question?

72
00:05:07,137 --> 00:05:10,547
- Yeah, I'm supposed to be in
the office while you do this.

73
00:05:10,551 --> 00:05:11,930
- What?

74
00:05:11,931 --> 00:05:13,791
- Well, my mom
said, I have a note.

75
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,450
- Can I see the note?
- Yeah

76
00:05:28,034 --> 00:05:30,723
you can just stay here,
I know I don't know

77
00:05:30,724 --> 00:05:33,826
the rest of your parents,
I just think it's important

78
00:05:33,827 --> 00:05:34,717
for me to say.

79
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:50,309
- Elle, your early.

80
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:51,999
- Yeah, I wanted to get
a headstart on the day

81
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,999
- Oh, well I can get you
a coffee or something

82
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,660
if you want I know I need one.

83
00:05:55,661 --> 00:05:57,475
- What are you doing?

84
00:05:57,482 --> 00:05:58,552
- What are you doing?

85
00:05:59,482 --> 00:06:00,522
- Where is everyone?

86
00:06:02,482 --> 00:06:04,067
- A meeting
- what?

87
00:06:05,655 --> 00:06:06,755
- What is going on?

88
00:06:07,689 --> 00:06:09,136
- Oh, are you going--

89
00:06:09,137 --> 00:06:11,237
- Thank you so much, please
carry on with your day.

90
00:06:14,827 --> 00:06:18,207
- Patricia!

91
00:06:22,448 --> 00:06:24,338
Your daughters here.

92
00:06:27,241 --> 00:06:29,619
- Oh thank you so much

93
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:32,930
- Elle, you found
us take a seat.

94
00:06:35,965 --> 00:06:36,895
Take a seat.

95
00:06:42,482 --> 00:06:45,999
As I was saying,
we've had a great year

96
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,790
and so I wanted to
give something back.

97
00:06:48,793 --> 00:06:53,550
This is Hunter, from
Frisky Hops Brewing.

98
00:06:53,551 --> 00:06:56,654
He's not our usual client
- or budget

99
00:06:56,655 --> 00:07:01,274
or budget, but I feel
like it's important for us

100
00:07:01,275 --> 00:07:03,755
to begin working with
more up and comers.

101
00:07:03,758 --> 00:07:04,588
They're so inspirador

102
00:07:09,517 --> 00:07:10,827
he's Portuguese.

103
00:07:11,827 --> 00:07:13,585
- Did you say Hunter?

104
00:07:13,586 --> 00:07:15,996
- Yes, like the
colorful wellies.

105
00:07:17,206 --> 00:07:19,026
- I'm sorry, am I
hallucinating, am I the only one

106
00:07:19,034 --> 00:07:23,274
in this room, it's
Frisky Hops Brewing?

107
00:07:23,275 --> 00:07:24,715
- Yeah, like bunnies yeah.

108
00:07:28,068 --> 00:07:29,758
- Nope

109
00:07:31,137 --> 00:07:32,655
- Hi sorry
I can't get to the phone

110
00:07:32,656 --> 00:07:33,825
right now, if you leave
your name and your number

111
00:07:33,827 --> 00:07:35,787
I'll get back to you, cheers.

112
00:07:37,241 --> 00:07:41,971
- Hi, I wanted to-- I would
have done this in person

113
00:07:44,586 --> 00:07:46,895
I mean on the phone but
at your face you know--

114
00:07:46,896 --> 00:07:48,066
fucking time difference.

115
00:07:50,034 --> 00:07:52,554
I think you should
cancel your flight.

116
00:07:52,555 --> 00:07:56,721
I'm just, I'm not--
I was always supposed

117
00:07:56,724 --> 00:07:59,484
to be coming back here, and
now it's like I am split

118
00:07:59,485 --> 00:08:02,619
in two places and
I thought we said

119
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:04,450
no social media
until I told everyone

120
00:08:04,451 --> 00:08:09,378
and I don't know if I want
to or can so I'm sorry.

121
00:08:20,655 --> 00:08:22,585
- You can't handle the musk!

122
00:08:24,793 --> 00:08:29,654
- Hi, hi hello our resources
are gonna be tapped

123
00:08:29,655 --> 00:08:32,135
because I fucking nailed
that oil and gas account.

124
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:35,070
He'll be signing any day so--

125
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:38,895
- Unfortunately the oil and
gas account fell through

126
00:08:38,896 --> 00:08:40,026
we'll discuss it later.

127
00:08:40,965 --> 00:08:43,135
So, Frisky.

128
00:08:46,241 --> 00:08:49,001
- There another up and
comer, actually so I'm gonna

129
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:51,829
- Not another brewery

130
00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:53,027
- Oh my god, thank you

131
00:08:53,034 --> 00:08:53,594
- I'm sorry to bug you at work

132
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,139
- Are you kidding, your
timing's perfect what's up?

133
00:08:57,140 --> 00:08:59,207
- I have--
- not now Jonathan!

134
00:09:01,586 --> 00:09:02,406
- Sorry

135
00:09:05,965 --> 00:09:08,135
- I got this,
double date tonight!

136
00:09:08,137 --> 00:09:10,617
- Did you hear me when I
said, I just broke up with her?

137
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:12,588
- Yes, I'm helping
let's get you laid.

138
00:09:12,589 --> 00:09:15,616
- I had a really bad
day at work can we just--

139
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:17,309
- Rosie's seven o' clock.

140
00:09:19,793 --> 00:09:21,313
- So do you know
your rising sign?

141
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:24,720
- I can't say that I do, no.

142
00:09:24,724 --> 00:09:27,553
- Some say it's more
important than your sun sign.

143
00:09:27,554 --> 00:09:29,311
- I don't know that either so

144
00:09:29,312 --> 00:09:31,205
- I'm an Aries,
with a Virgo rising.

145
00:09:32,034 --> 00:09:34,240
- Oh, a magician.

146
00:09:34,241 --> 00:09:38,481
- It's just science,
so I make music.

147
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,447
My music is like violins mixed
with electronica and bass

148
00:09:45,448 --> 00:09:48,828
and raw recordings
of exotic bird songs.

149
00:09:49,655 --> 00:09:52,685
- Wow
- sounds good

150
00:09:52,689 --> 00:09:54,207
it would be really
special to me if you could

151
00:09:54,208 --> 00:09:55,166
witness my art.

152
00:09:56,034 --> 00:09:58,930
- Yeah, I will check my--

153
00:09:58,931 --> 00:10:03,831
- I go to the zoo
with a boom mic

154
00:10:04,758 --> 00:10:07,654
and I antagonize the parrots.

155
00:10:07,655 --> 00:10:08,925
- Going well over there?

156
00:10:08,931 --> 00:10:10,791
- I hate him.

157
00:10:10,793 --> 00:10:12,102
Rosie!

158
00:10:12,103 --> 00:10:13,833
- I am a bartender, I promise.

159
00:10:14,896 --> 00:10:18,446
Jake
- it's just, not my day

160
00:10:19,965 --> 00:10:21,545
white wine, please.

161
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,860
- That is a very standard
order, you know that right?

162
00:10:29,896 --> 00:10:33,546
- More, more, more
- okay all right okay

163
00:10:34,724 --> 00:10:37,834
oh, that's my drink,
and some shots.

164
00:10:40,103 --> 00:10:40,933
- So ladylike.

165
00:10:42,862 --> 00:10:46,757
- Throw food at them, they
make the craziest sounds

166
00:10:46,758 --> 00:10:48,548
when they're agitated
- yeah

167
00:10:49,965 --> 00:10:51,205
Wanna see a trick?

168
00:10:51,206 --> 00:10:53,786
- Oh boy, everyone's
a magician today.

169
00:10:53,793 --> 00:10:58,763
Oh look at you, taking
that and this one

170
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:02,410
those are really full Jeff.

171
00:11:02,413 --> 00:11:04,213
- Well that's how you like it.

172
00:11:07,310 --> 00:11:09,100
- what?

173
00:11:09,103 --> 00:11:10,103
- Take two trips.

174
00:11:13,724 --> 00:11:16,590
- I got you something,
it reminds me of your beautiful eyes

175
00:11:16,591 --> 00:11:17,926
in your Bi-cupid profile pic.

176
00:11:17,931 --> 00:11:19,341
- I don't have a
Bi-cupid profile--

177
00:11:19,344 --> 00:11:22,034
- Oh you do now, don't
worry gotcha, hi.

178
00:11:25,793 --> 00:11:28,663
- Thank you
- Nice

179
00:11:34,379 --> 00:11:37,969
is everything okay?

180
00:11:40,793 --> 00:11:44,451
- When I first saw that
crystal, I thought it was meant

181
00:11:44,452 --> 00:11:46,618
for you, but now that I
see the two of you together

182
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:50,720
I realize it was
really meant for me.

183
00:11:50,724 --> 00:11:51,524
- Oh Howard no.

184
00:11:52,758 --> 00:11:55,718
- Yeah you can totally
have that back forever

185
00:11:55,724 --> 00:11:56,524
- Thank you
- Yup

186
00:11:59,655 --> 00:12:02,305
- I'll leave the back door open.

187
00:12:02,310 --> 00:12:03,140
- Awesome.

188
00:12:05,344 --> 00:12:07,102
- Did he just order another date

189
00:12:07,103 --> 00:12:09,001
while he was sitting across
from you at the table?

190
00:12:09,002 --> 00:12:10,450
- Yeah, it's good
to have a roladex.

191
00:12:10,451 --> 00:12:12,928
He's my Tuesday night, welcome
back to the single life.

192
00:12:12,931 --> 00:12:15,757
- In what world was
this going to help?

193
00:12:15,758 --> 00:12:17,478
- Oh no, it's
helping don't worry.

194
00:12:20,724 --> 00:12:23,074
- I'd like a dark room and
some covers now please.

195
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:24,858
- I wanna play pinball.

196
00:12:24,862 --> 00:12:27,142
- It's Robo Cop pinball.
- Not for you, Howard

197
00:12:35,724 --> 00:12:38,034
- God that guy was so weird.

198
00:12:40,241 --> 00:12:42,381
- Hey
- hi

199
00:12:43,551 --> 00:12:47,585
- Rub my back, so what
are you guys up to?

200
00:12:47,586 --> 00:12:52,236
- My mom brought her man child
fucking affair to the office

201
00:12:52,241 --> 00:12:55,550
you know, new love
PDA is one thing

202
00:12:55,551 --> 00:12:58,171
but seeing it from my mom is--

203
00:12:58,172 --> 00:13:01,520
- Oh so once I birth this thing
I'm not allowed to make out

204
00:13:01,521 --> 00:13:02,927
with my wife in public anymore?

205
00:13:02,931 --> 00:13:05,101
- You're not my mom thank god

206
00:13:05,103 --> 00:13:07,723
I am the Senior Account
Manager, she can't just

207
00:13:07,724 --> 00:13:09,761
onboard a client
because she's dating him

208
00:13:09,762 --> 00:13:10,998
there is a protocol.

209
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,139
- Since when have you
cared about protocol?

210
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:15,547
- I thought you only got the
job because your her daughter.

211
00:13:15,551 --> 00:13:18,791
- Everyone just loved Hunter
of course, fucking child groom.

212
00:13:18,793 --> 00:13:19,895
- I think it's a sign

213
00:13:19,896 --> 00:13:20,926
- Yeah it's
signaling to everyone

214
00:13:20,931 --> 00:13:22,341
that she's lost her damn mind.

215
00:13:22,344 --> 00:13:25,412
- No, the universe is
telling you to cut the cord.

216
00:13:25,413 --> 00:13:27,003
- Yeah find another agency,
then you don't have to

217
00:13:27,004 --> 00:13:28,964
stare at her face everyday.

218
00:13:28,965 --> 00:13:31,995
Or move to another
country, that works too.

219
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,790
- You know what, oh my
god yes you're right

220
00:13:35,793 --> 00:13:37,830
I'm gonna buy my dad a sailboat.

221
00:13:37,831 --> 00:13:40,067

- What are you doing?

7
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:45,100
- It's bulletproof coffee.

8
00:00:45,103 --> 00:00:47,659
You know ghee. Just
out powdered greens.

9
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:48,964
It's health squared.

10
00:00:48,965 --> 00:00:50,825
- You must be very
good at your job.

11
00:00:50,827 --> 00:00:53,277
- I think I'm starting
to embrace change.

12
00:00:53,278 --> 00:00:55,855
- Coffee, black for you.

13
00:00:55,862 --> 00:00:57,309
Put that on.

14
00:00:57,310 --> 00:00:58,999
- How are you not hungover?

15
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,759
- Wake up with determination,
go to bed with satisfaction.

16
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:04,067
- Well I think that poster's
in the teachers lounge.

18
00:01:05,793 --> 00:01:07,447
You wanna ride to work?

19
00:01:07,448 --> 00:01:10,928
- No I'm not feeling very
good. I'm not going in today.

20
00:01:12,689 --> 00:01:14,279
- Oh we gotta braid those later.

21
00:01:15,482 --> 00:01:16,342
Hang in there.

22
00:01:16,344 --> 00:01:17,174

00:02:04,655 --> 00:02:05,475
No.

24
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,830
- Is this how we
dress for work now?

25
00:02:22,068 --> 00:02:23,757
- No.

26
00:02:23,758 --> 00:02:26,548
Team building
zamba, the calendar.

27
00:02:26,551 --> 00:02:27,999
Read it.

28
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,826
- Are we just not gonna talk
about you and dad or...?

29
00:02:30,827 --> 00:02:31,617
- Can it wait?

30
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:32,895
- Oh absolutely. Yeah.

31
00:02:32,896 --> 00:02:34,616
No I would've loved to
talk about, you know,

32
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:36,999
you bringing on your new
child groom as a client

33
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,720
at our coffee meeting, but hey!

34
00:02:40,862 --> 00:02:43,999
- I was gonna try and
set up a dinner and...

35
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,340
it's all really very
complicated right now.

36
00:02:46,344 --> 00:02:47,414
- You don't get
to stop showing up

37
00:02:47,415 --> 00:02:49,723
just because it's complicated.

38
00:02:49,724 --> 00:02:52,343
- Elle I don't wanna
talk about this at work.

39
00:02:52,344 --> 00:02:53,619
We'll find a time.

40
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:54,410
Let's go.

41
00:02:56,379 --> 00:02:57,969
- All right, ratty patty.

42
00:02:57,970 --> 00:03:01,545
You want zamba zamba,
I'll give you zamba zamba.

43
00:03:09,862 --> 00:03:10,895
- Okay thank you so much.

44
00:03:10,896 --> 00:03:11,716
Thank you.

45
00:03:13,206 --> 00:03:14,206
- Okay everyone.

46
00:03:14,207 --> 00:03:15,546
Let's take a trip to Brazil.

47
00:03:17,068 --> 00:03:20,138
- Perfect. I just started
learning Portuguese.

48
00:03:22,482 --> 00:03:24,412
It means exciting.

49
00:03:24,413 --> 00:03:25,932
- Hey Pat, let's focus.

50
00:03:25,933 --> 00:03:28,451
- Love that drive Elle.
Don't call me Pat.

51
00:03:28,452 --> 00:03:30,757

53
00:03:49,482 --> 00:03:50,312
Arms.

54
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:56,410
- Jesus.

55
00:04:25,241 --> 00:04:26,101
- Let's try this.

56
00:04:27,172 --> 00:04:28,516
Say ta-ta-ha

57
00:04:28,517 --> 00:04:29,787

58
00:04:29,793 --> 00:04:31,453
and over cross turn.

59
00:04:33,689 --> 00:04:35,999
Okay now let's try it
for real. You guys ready?

60
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:36,930
Here we go.

61
00:04:42,482 --> 00:04:44,102
That's it.

62
00:04:44,103 --> 00:04:44,973
- Oh.

63
00:04:44,974 --> 00:04:46,445
- Oh Patricia.

64
00:04:46,448 --> 00:04:47,308
- Oh ow ow ow.

65
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:48,380
- Oh my God Patricia.

66
00:04:48,381 --> 00:04:49,789
- Ops.

67
00:04:49,793 --> 00:04:51,240
I guess these hips do lie.

68
00:04:51,241 --> 00:04:52,831
- You're doing really
great for your age.

69
00:04:52,832 --> 00:04:54,067
- I'm just a romantic.

70
00:04:54,068 --> 00:04:55,274
I love to dance.

71
00:04:55,275 --> 00:04:56,825
- Better up that
calcium intake then.

72
00:04:56,827 --> 00:04:58,516
- It's just a strain babes.

73
00:04:58,517 --> 00:05:00,207
We just put some ice in this.

74
00:05:00,208 --> 00:05:02,236
- You're so knowledgeable.

75
00:05:02,241 --> 00:05:04,381
- You do that I
have a phone call.

76
00:05:19,551 --> 00:05:20,791
- Garry, hi.

77
00:05:20,793 --> 00:05:22,173
Elle Fielding, how are you?

78
00:05:22,174 --> 00:05:24,140
Very well thanks
it's been a while.

79
00:05:24,141 --> 00:05:26,136
I was hoping to
open a new account.

80
00:05:26,137 --> 00:05:28,027
A business account.

81
00:05:28,034 --> 00:05:30,624
No, it'll be under a
different name actually.

82
00:05:32,413 --> 00:05:33,243
Great.

83
00:05:48,172 --> 00:05:49,342
- Ms. Philips?

84
00:05:49,344 --> 00:05:50,174
- No!

85
00:05:51,241 --> 00:05:52,826
Hi.

86
00:05:52,827 --> 00:05:54,337
We've never met.

87
00:05:54,344 --> 00:05:57,214
- My son Garret is in your
grade eight French class.

88
00:05:57,215 --> 00:05:58,786
- Oh. Hi.

89
00:05:58,793 --> 00:06:00,309
I'm Molly--

90
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:01,480
- Yeah and my daughter
Jill is in the grade six,

91
00:06:01,482 --> 00:06:02,932
gym class you cover.

92
00:06:04,068 --> 00:06:05,516
- Oh.

93
00:06:05,517 --> 00:06:08,447
- The parents association isn't
happy about what happened.

94
00:06:08,448 --> 00:06:11,067
- I understand. I
took the suspension--

95
00:06:11,068 --> 00:06:12,618
- We've been making
calls about you

96
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:14,139
and I would appreciate it

97
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:16,787
if my child doesn't come home
telling me a bisexual women--

98
00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:19,763
- Stick to threatening your
children sexual education.

99
00:06:19,764 --> 00:06:21,447
okay lady?

100
00:06:21,448 --> 00:06:22,828
I'm of the clock.

101
00:06:49,793 --> 00:06:51,033
- Hey.

102
00:06:51,034 --> 00:06:52,274
- Hey.

103
00:06:52,275 --> 00:06:54,654
- Huh. Getting used
to that app thing huh?

104
00:06:54,655 --> 00:06:56,065
- Ah I guess.

105
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:01,030
- Oh no!

106
00:07:01,034 --> 00:07:02,034
- What?

107
00:07:02,035 --> 00:07:03,792
- You lost another one.

108
00:07:03,793 --> 00:07:04,999
- Huh?

109
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,480
- Oh nothing. This girl
that I grew up with

110
00:07:07,482 --> 00:07:08,932
she came out before me.

111
00:07:08,933 --> 00:07:10,031
Like lesb for life.

112
00:07:10,034 --> 00:07:10,904
- Mm-hmm.

113
00:07:10,905 --> 00:07:12,376
- Like the most.

114
00:07:12,379 --> 00:07:14,969
She just got hitched to a guy
with a man bun and a beard.

115
00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:16,545
- So she's bi.

116
00:07:17,965 --> 00:07:20,025
- And that just means you
kissed a girl in high school?

117
00:07:29,655 --> 00:07:30,475
- Oh.

118
00:07:32,931 --> 00:07:34,791
- There's no way you're
gonna have feelings

119
00:07:34,793 --> 00:07:35,863
for a guy like that.

120
00:07:35,864 --> 00:07:37,171
- That's the point.

121
00:07:37,172 --> 00:07:38,688
- What do you mean?

122
00:07:38,689 --> 00:07:41,619
- Superficial and easy sound
real good right about now.

123
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:42,930
- Oh.

124
00:07:42,931 --> 00:07:43,829
You're there ah?

125
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:44,757
- Mm-hmm.

126
00:07:44,758 --> 00:07:45,586
- Okay.

127
00:07:45,587 --> 00:07:46,546
- I'm not ashamed.

128
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:48,277
- No, no.

129
00:07:48,278 --> 00:07:49,095
Do your thing.

130
00:07:49,103 --> 00:07:50,205
- Bye!

131
00:07:50,206 --> 00:07:51,096
- D-T-F everybody.

132
00:07:51,103 --> 00:07:52,073
- Yeah!

133
00:07:52,074 --> 00:07:53,478
- D yeah.

134
00:07:53,482 --> 00:07:54,688
Be safe.

135
00:07:54,689 --> 00:07:56,029
Have fun.

136
00:09:03,448 --> 00:09:04,688
- Yeah you.

137
00:09:04,689 --> 00:09:06,137
- What? Can you get
this up there for me.

138
00:09:06,138 --> 00:09:06,997
- Yes ma'am.

139
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,654
- Thank you.

140
00:09:08,655 --> 00:09:11,895
- Hey do you know that
beaver anal glands--

141
00:09:11,896 --> 00:09:13,306
- I don't wanna hear this again.

142
00:09:13,310 --> 00:09:14,380
You told me already.

143
00:09:16,206 --> 00:09:17,206
- Where is she?

144
00:09:17,207 --> 00:09:18,236
- She left.

145
00:09:18,241 --> 00:09:19,721
Went on a date I think.

146
00:09:19,724 --> 00:09:21,240
- By her self?

147
00:09:21,241 --> 00:09:24,067
- Isn't that how it
happens with people.

148
00:09:24,068 --> 00:09:26,136
- Yes, yes. Sorry yes.

149
00:09:26,137 --> 00:09:27,067
My brain is too full.

150
00:09:27,068 --> 00:09:28,478
I'm... you know what?

151
00:09:28,482 --> 00:09:30,522
I'm just gonna-- I'm
gonna-- I'll work from here.

152
00:09:31,482 --> 00:09:32,792
- You're gonna work?

153
00:09:37,413 --> 00:09:38,723
- Go for Elle?

154
00:09:38,724 --> 00:09:39,554
Yes.

155
00:09:40,551 --> 00:09:41,895
- There it is.

156
00:09:41,896 --> 00:09:43,476
- Wow she's actually doing work.

157
00:09:45,206 --> 00:09:46,376
You're being creepy.

158
00:09:46,379 --> 00:09:47,209
- What?

159
00:09:47,210 --> 00:09:48,476
No I'm not. I--

160
00:09:48,482 --> 00:09:51,447
- Hey she.. she's
a praying mantis.

161
00:09:51,448 --> 00:09:53,718
I love her but
she'll eat you alive.

162
00:09:53,724 --> 00:09:54,904
- That's what I want.

163
00:09:56,137 --> 00:09:57,067
- No.

164
00:09:57,068 --> 00:09:58,098
- I want a man eater.

165
00:09:59,379 --> 00:10:00,688
She's ballsy.

166
00:10:00,689 --> 00:10:02,619
- Balls are weak.

167
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:04,030
- Spunky.

168
00:10:04,034 --> 00:10:04,904
- Gross.

169
00:10:09,482 --> 00:10:10,310
Where are you going?

170
00:10:10,311 --> 00:10:11,138
- I gotta do something.

171
00:10:11,139 --> 00:10:11,997
- What are you doing?

172
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,309
- I'm doing a thing.

173
00:10:13,310 --> 00:10:14,860
- What kind of thing?

174
00:10:14,862 --> 00:10:18,240
- Just uh... just working.
- Can I hae a shot please?

175
00:10:18,241 --> 00:10:19,930
- Certainly. What are
you doing here anyways?

176
00:10:19,931 --> 00:10:20,861
I thought you had a...

177
00:10:20,862 --> 00:10:22,757
client shmooze.

178
00:10:22,758 --> 00:10:25,408
- I was but he just sent
the signed contract.

179
00:10:25,413 --> 00:10:28,102
So drinks and shmooze was
probably drinks and shmacks

180
00:10:28,103 --> 00:10:30,553
and no time for boom
boom only conquer.

181
00:10:30,554 --> 00:10:33,067
- No time for
shmcks or boom boom?

182
00:10:33,068 --> 00:10:34,964
That's a new Elle.

183
00:10:34,965 --> 00:10:36,445
- New wish, new room.

184
00:10:43,862 --> 00:10:45,861
Hey, uh wha-- ah?

185
00:10:45,862 --> 00:10:46,762
- What are you doing?

186
00:10:46,763 --> 00:10:48,028
What you working on?

187
00:10:48,965 --> 00:10:50,545
Come here a lot?

188
00:10:50,551 --> 00:10:51,519
- Obviously I do.

189
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:52,477
- Yeah, no I was just joking.

190
00:10:54,206 --> 00:10:56,096
- Aren't you supposed to
be on that side of the bar?

191
00:10:57,551 --> 00:10:59,591
- Aren't you supposed
to be guarding...

192
00:10:59,592 --> 00:11:02,166
jewels and treasure
inside of a map?

193
00:11:02,172 --> 00:11:03,000
- What?

194
00:11:03,001 --> 00:11:03,970
- What?

195
00:11:03,971 --> 00:11:05,305
- Are you calling me a dragon?

196
00:11:05,310 --> 00:11:06,790
- Aren't you a dragon?

197
00:11:07,862 --> 00:11:08,862
What?

198
00:11:08,862 --> 00:11:09,830
- That's--
- That's--

199
00:11:09,831 --> 00:11:10,655
- I--

200
00:11:10,656 --> 00:11:11,475
- What?

201
00:11:12,689 --> 00:11:15,279
- Um I just came
over to talk to you.

202
00:11:16,172 --> 00:11:17,142
To say hello.

203
00:11:17,143 --> 00:11:18,617
- Okay.

204
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:20,240
- Cooley calmly say hello,

205
00:11:20,241 --> 00:11:23,211
and if you hate me I will let
you push me off this stool.

206
00:11:24,103 --> 00:11:24,973
- No, no, no.

207
00:11:26,586 --> 00:11:27,446
If you hate me.

208
00:11:27,448 --> 00:11:28,688
- I think I might.

209
00:11:28,689 --> 00:11:31,136
- Oh. I've barely
opened my mouth.

210
00:11:31,137 --> 00:11:34,617
Look, no hands, no legs.

211
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:37,030
I mean I've got legs and
hands, but I'm just saying...

212
00:11:37,034 --> 00:11:38,481
I mean you can push me.

213
00:11:38,482 --> 00:11:40,212
- Oh my God. All right fine.
- Oh Bluetooth is out.

214
00:11:40,213 --> 00:11:41,716
- I will--
- Bluetooth is out.

215
00:11:43,413 --> 00:11:44,313
- I'll give you 30 minutes.

216
00:11:44,314 --> 00:11:45,688
- 30 minutes?

217
00:11:45,689 --> 00:11:47,169
Oh my God, that's...

218
00:11:47,172 --> 00:11:50,481
I'm on like a five minute break
that I didn't even ask for.

219
00:11:50,482 --> 00:11:51,999
- You have exactly
seven minutes.

220
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:52,860
- I'm on it.

221
00:11:57,931 --> 00:11:59,971
- This is from the guy
at the end of the bar.

222
00:12:02,827 --> 00:12:04,857
- I don't see why it matters.

223
00:12:04,862 --> 00:12:07,552
Why do I have to go around
explaining who I'm sleeping with

224
00:12:07,553 --> 00:12:08,621
to everyone in my life?

225
00:12:08,622 --> 00:12:09,860
It's weird.

226
00:12:09,862 --> 00:12:11,242
I've never had to
do that before.

227
00:12:11,243 --> 00:12:12,521
- Well you don't have to.

228
00:12:12,522 --> 00:12:13,757
Okay?

229
00:12:13,758 --> 00:12:16,478
And listen I know
exactly how you feel.

230
00:12:17,655 --> 00:12:18,475
All right?

231
00:12:19,758 --> 00:12:21,238
And um,

232
00:12:21,241 --> 00:12:23,791
I just wanted to make sure
that you're okay with this.

233
00:12:23,793 --> 00:12:25,551
- The guys at the bar wanted
me to bring you these,

234
00:12:25,552 --> 00:12:27,691
but should I just tell them
you're having a girls night?

235
00:12:27,692 --> 00:12:29,029
- Um, well uh well--

236
00:12:29,034 --> 00:12:30,274
- No.

237
00:12:30,275 --> 00:12:32,615
Tell them to go
fuck them selves.

238
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:35,309
Because that's what
we're doing tonight.

239
00:12:35,310 --> 00:12:36,449
Not our selves but each--

240
00:12:36,450 --> 00:12:37,658
we fuck each other.

241
00:12:37,659 --> 00:12:38,964
- Oh really?

242
00:12:38,965 --> 00:12:40,755
- Yes.

243
00:12:40,758 --> 00:12:41,588
Really.

244
00:12:48,103 --> 00:12:49,693
- Yeah see that was um..

245
00:12:51,482 --> 00:12:52,482
a little bit too much.

246
00:12:52,482 --> 00:12:53,312
- I can't win.

247
00:13:00,758 --> 00:13:02,308
Oh,

248
00:13:02,310 --> 00:13:03,590
God that's bad.

249
00:13:14,241 --> 00:13:15,449
- Hey you've reached Elle.

250
00:13:15,450 --> 00:13:16,378
I can't get to the phone
but leave a message

251
00:13:16,379 --> 00:13:17,789
and I'll call you right back.

252
00:13:31,586 --> 00:13:32,446
- Hi you've reached Meredith.

253
00:13:32,448 --> 00:13:33,657
I'm away from my phone

254
00:13:33,658 --> 00:13:35,405
but I'll call you
back as soon as I can.

255
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:53,410
- Here.

256
00:13:54,758 --> 00:13:55,548
Be careful,

257
00:13:56,517 --> 00:13:57,787
those things break hearts.

1
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:22,999
- Have you ever
had a tiny moment

2
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,240
when you first wake up

3
00:00:24,241 --> 00:00:26,141
where if you were
given the option

4
00:00:26,142 --> 00:00:28,407
to never have to get up again

5
00:00:28,413 --> 00:00:30,383
but you had to
die, you'd take it?

6
00:00:31,241 --> 00:00:32,241
- That's a solid no.

7
00:00:33,689 --> 00:00:34,589
- Me neither.

8
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:36,756
- Shower. Come, shower.

9
00:00:46,344 --> 00:00:47,144
- So

10
00:00:49,517 --> 00:00:50,407
you had a date last night?

11
00:00:50,413 --> 00:00:51,654
Did you bang?

12
00:00:51,655 --> 00:00:52,615
Man or woman?

13
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:54,826
- Man, I don't wanna date women.

14
00:00:54,827 --> 00:00:56,717
- Molly you shaved?

15
00:00:56,724 --> 00:00:58,309
Are you okay?

16
00:00:59,551 --> 00:01:01,411
- Look, I tried to call
you back, but you--

17
00:01:01,413 --> 00:01:03,067
- I lost my phone.

18
00:01:03,068 --> 00:01:03,928
- No.

19
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:07,520
- Also, you literally
disappeared.

20
00:01:07,521 --> 00:01:08,654
- Clearly not.

21
00:01:08,655 --> 00:01:09,585
- Oh, like virtually
disappeared.

22
00:01:09,586 --> 00:01:10,756
All your medias.

23
00:01:10,758 --> 00:01:12,238
Is this some new
teacher's rules crap?

24
00:01:12,241 --> 00:01:15,591
- No, just take me back to
a time before the internet.

25
00:01:15,592 --> 00:01:17,096
- Pass.

26
00:01:17,103 --> 00:01:21,033
- Fine, then stay home and
watch old movies with me?

27
00:01:21,034 --> 00:01:22,414
You said you do

28
00:01:22,415 --> 00:01:24,002
what you want, self-care.

29
00:01:24,003 --> 00:01:27,100
- And I do, but on the weekends,
that's what they're for.

30
00:01:27,103 --> 00:01:28,143
Weekend.

31
00:01:29,586 --> 00:01:31,066
Isn't this already your
second day off this week?

32
00:01:31,068 --> 00:01:32,585
It's Tuesday.

33
00:01:32,586 --> 00:01:35,166
- How many hours of overtime
have you been putting in?

34
00:01:35,172 --> 00:01:37,240
That's not healthy.

35
00:01:37,241 --> 00:01:38,721
Self-care.

36
00:01:38,724 --> 00:01:40,452
- You do know that you actually
have to do something, right?

37
00:01:40,453 --> 00:01:41,788
Like you have to take
care of yourself.

38
00:01:41,793 --> 00:01:43,999
You can't just say self-care?

39
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:44,830
Meditate.

40
00:01:44,831 --> 00:01:46,067
Go for a run.

41
00:01:46,068 --> 00:01:47,138
Do you want a smoothie?

42
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:51,100
Okay, you get cozy then.

43
00:01:56,655 --> 00:01:57,475
- Have a good day.

44
00:01:57,482 --> 00:01:59,282
- Bye

45
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,619
- There's something
to your eyes, right Phil?

46
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:06,660
And we talk to him more
about that in a second.

47
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:12,858
- Now you know, and I know

48
00:02:12,862 --> 00:02:15,240
and Teddy knows

49
00:02:15,241 --> 00:02:19,136
that loving will never go
to the other side

50
00:02:29,413 --> 00:02:32,033
- Oh. Hi honey, I brought soup

51
00:02:32,034 --> 00:02:34,343
and some stuff you
left at the house.

52
00:02:35,175 --> 00:02:36,309
Can I come in?

53
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:37,450
- Yeah. Sorry.

54
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:39,660
- So how are you feeling?

55
00:02:41,965 --> 00:02:44,335
- I've got a fever
and I'm definitely

56
00:02:44,344 --> 00:02:46,516
coming down with something.

57
00:02:46,517 --> 00:02:48,547
- Well transitions take energy.

58
00:02:53,724 --> 00:02:54,864
Ah, honey.

59
00:02:55,827 --> 00:02:57,826
Come here.

60
00:02:58,828 --> 00:03:00,167
I'm so proud of you.

61
00:03:01,137 --> 00:03:02,964
How's it all going anyway?

62
00:03:02,965 --> 00:03:04,135
- It's

63
00:03:04,137 --> 00:03:04,997
fine.

64
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:08,310
- Your head doesn't
feel very hot.

65
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:11,240
- Okay, thanks for coming by.

66
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,860
- Get dressed, get
in the car. Come on.

67
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:17,552
- Mom, I really don't want to.
- Come on.

68
00:03:17,553 --> 00:03:21,101
- Come on. I birthed
you, you owe me.

69
00:03:21,103 --> 00:03:22,381
Start by putting on a bra

70
00:03:22,382 --> 00:03:24,309
you'll feel a lot
better, right away.

71
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:25,140
- Ma...

72
00:03:27,933 --> 00:03:29,550
- You do look badass.

73
00:03:29,551 --> 00:03:31,378
- We do look badass.

74
00:03:31,379 --> 00:03:32,789
Okay, your turn, come on.

75
00:03:32,793 --> 00:03:34,003
See the little puddle there?

76
00:03:34,004 --> 00:03:35,999
Just keep your eye on that.

77
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,309
I'll help guide your hand.

78
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:38,550
- Mom

79
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:40,001
- It's okay, just
squeeze the trigger.

80
00:03:40,002 --> 00:03:41,278
That's good.

81
00:03:41,279 --> 00:03:43,515
There you go.
- I don't know what I'm doing.

82
00:03:43,517 --> 00:03:44,897
- Oh, we'll just try it again.

83
00:03:44,898 --> 00:03:46,966
Just give it another try.

84
00:03:46,967 --> 00:03:49,135
- just watch you do it?

85
00:03:49,137 --> 00:03:49,997
- Molly.

86
00:03:51,137 --> 00:03:53,207
You can't decide you're
at something

87
00:03:53,208 --> 00:03:54,826
before you've given it a shot.

88
00:03:54,827 --> 00:03:57,067
- Mom

89
00:03:57,068 --> 00:04:01,168
- Look, you did so much to
get a full time job here

90
00:04:01,172 --> 00:04:04,382
I thought you'd be excited
and ready to dig in and

91
00:04:04,383 --> 00:04:06,654
go forward and self sabotage--

92
00:04:06,655 --> 00:04:08,515
- No, no psycho babble
please, Meredith.

93
00:04:08,517 --> 00:04:09,967
- You don't answer my calls.

94
00:04:09,968 --> 00:04:11,585
You left in a huff.

95
00:04:11,586 --> 00:04:13,476
You needed space,
I gave you that.

96
00:04:13,482 --> 00:04:15,240
But listen...

97
00:04:15,241 --> 00:04:17,761
There is clearly something
else going on here.

98
00:04:17,762 --> 00:04:19,478
What is it?

99
00:04:19,482 --> 00:04:20,412
Come on honey, just--

100
00:04:20,413 --> 00:04:22,033
- They made me teach gym.

101
00:04:25,103 --> 00:04:26,003
- You?

102
00:04:26,965 --> 00:04:28,995
Gym?
- And sex ed.

103
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,516
And

104
00:04:30,517 --> 00:04:34,167
there was this kid who had a
note from his ignorant parents

105
00:04:34,172 --> 00:04:36,274
and I just saw red.

106
00:04:36,275 --> 00:04:38,095
- Okay, all right, so

107
00:04:38,103 --> 00:04:40,723
god what do you even
teach with sex anymore?

108
00:04:40,724 --> 00:04:42,004
- Just the curriculum, Mom.

109
00:04:42,005 --> 00:04:45,410
But instead, I said
that whether or not

110
00:04:45,413 --> 00:04:47,343
their parents want to
blind them of the facts

111
00:04:47,344 --> 00:04:49,660
some families are very happy

112
00:04:49,661 --> 00:04:51,165
with two moms or two dads.

113
00:04:51,172 --> 00:04:52,654
- Completely.

114
00:04:52,655 --> 00:04:54,855
- And sometimes even grade
eight French teachers

115
00:04:54,862 --> 00:04:57,171
who have men their entire lives

116
00:04:57,172 --> 00:04:58,585
and loved it.

117
00:04:58,586 --> 00:05:00,585
Suddenly you just
fall for someone

118
00:05:00,586 --> 00:05:03,516
who happens to have a vagina.

119
00:05:03,517 --> 00:05:06,027
Those people are
called bisexuals.

120
00:05:06,034 --> 00:05:07,694
And they are all around us.

121
00:05:10,344 --> 00:05:11,964
They were 12.

122
00:05:11,965 --> 00:05:12,785
So...

123
00:05:14,206 --> 00:05:17,406
I would be working hard,
but the school told me

124
00:05:17,413 --> 00:05:18,623
to take two days off.

125
00:05:20,482 --> 00:05:21,312
- Oh Moll.

126
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:25,660
- There was this
woman, in London.

127
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:30,100
I was in love with her.

128
00:05:30,103 --> 00:05:30,973
I think.

129
00:05:32,275 --> 00:05:34,965
I know we haven't really
talked about that.

130
00:05:35,896 --> 00:05:37,786
It's over now, anyway.

131
00:05:37,793 --> 00:05:38,623
- Molly.

132
00:05:40,206 --> 00:05:44,926
Your dad and I are very open
minded about this sweetie.

133
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:50,826
In fact, we've had an open
marriage for 40 years.

134
00:05:53,275 --> 00:05:54,515
Oh baby.

135
00:05:59,931 --> 00:06:01,101
- No.

136
00:06:01,103 --> 00:06:02,213
how--
- Honey.

137
00:06:02,214 --> 00:06:04,966
No, no, no, no we have to talk.

138
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:06,830
Honey.

139
00:06:07,655 --> 00:06:09,375
Oh, for Pete's sake.

140
00:06:21,896 --> 00:06:26,586
- Healthy

141
00:06:30,965 --> 00:06:31,785
Jackpot.

142
00:06:32,724 --> 00:06:35,619
♪ Beating on my lonely drum

143
00:07:22,862 --> 00:07:27,212
- Oh,

144
00:07:29,689 --> 00:07:31,205
- Order up.

145
00:07:31,206 --> 00:07:33,306
Come and have a seat honey,
I made you a grilled cheese

146
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:35,654
and a nice glass of homo milk.

147
00:07:35,655 --> 00:07:37,135
- Typecast.

148
00:07:37,137 --> 00:07:39,687
- Well now, I think you look
positively chrome plated.

149
00:07:39,689 --> 00:07:42,239
You ordered a time
before the internet?

150
00:07:42,241 --> 00:07:43,071
Order up.

151
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,136
- Mom?

152
00:07:45,137 --> 00:07:46,617
- I would just like Jell-O.

153
00:07:47,793 --> 00:07:50,343
And an apology because
you're being judgemental

154
00:07:50,344 --> 00:07:51,172
and

155
00:07:51,173 --> 00:07:52,072
unfair and

156
00:07:53,137 --> 00:07:54,997
you should just call me.

157
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,210
- Can I get you
anything in the meantime

158
00:07:56,211 --> 00:07:57,966
while you hold your breath? No?

159
00:07:57,967 --> 00:07:59,405
- Mom, I--
- No time

160
00:07:59,413 --> 00:08:02,033
I got someone important
I want you to meet.

161
00:08:02,034 --> 00:08:04,240
- Is that--
- The Kate Hepburn.

162
00:08:04,241 --> 00:08:06,411
Married to a friend and
living in the closet.

163
00:08:06,413 --> 00:08:08,723
You can always pull a
Hepburn-Tracy special.

164
00:08:08,724 --> 00:08:10,692
But wouldn't it be
easier to just go to her?

165
00:08:10,693 --> 00:08:12,549
- Nothing for me, but Tracy.

166
00:08:14,137 --> 00:08:15,927
I know your reputation Scotty.

167
00:08:15,931 --> 00:08:17,101
And when you get the chance

168
00:08:17,103 --> 00:08:19,523
can you find a nice
dark-haired girl for me?

169
00:08:19,524 --> 00:08:22,237
Someone that isn't
too heavily made up?

170
00:08:22,241 --> 00:08:24,240
- Why is she calling me Scotty?

171
00:08:24,241 --> 00:08:25,550
- Look in your pocket.

172
00:08:25,551 --> 00:08:27,101
That little black book?

173
00:08:27,103 --> 00:08:29,102
You're the dating app.

174
00:08:29,103 --> 00:08:29,973
Whoop.

175
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:35,136
- I'm gonna slap a morals
clause on every contract

176
00:08:35,137 --> 00:08:36,654
for every actor.

177
00:08:36,655 --> 00:08:39,545
Now that should shut them up
and leave them in the closet.

178
00:08:42,931 --> 00:08:45,931
I'm obviously way more
woke than that sweetie.

179
00:08:47,034 --> 00:08:49,243
But you are so
totally polyphobic

180
00:08:49,244 --> 00:08:51,658
and it really doesn't look
nice on you.

181
00:08:51,659 --> 00:08:52,825
So call your mother.

182
00:08:52,827 --> 00:08:53,997
Please.

183
00:08:55,241 --> 00:08:57,964
- Greta, what are you having?

184
00:08:57,965 --> 00:09:00,095
- Coffee, with a swirl.

185
00:09:00,103 --> 00:09:02,205
And keep that on the down low.

186
00:09:02,206 --> 00:09:03,686
What fun is an exciting secret

187
00:09:03,689 --> 00:09:05,859
when it isn't a secret anymore?

188
00:09:05,862 --> 00:09:07,826
Stay a bachelor, honey.

189
00:09:07,827 --> 00:09:10,516
Wife is such an ugly word.

190
00:09:10,517 --> 00:09:12,136
- Kept it to herself
and stayed single.

191
00:09:12,137 --> 00:09:13,617
So that's always an option.

192
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:14,520
- I like her.

193
00:09:14,521 --> 00:09:15,757
- Not so fast.

194
00:09:15,758 --> 00:09:17,138
The reason for
Garbo's reclusiveness

195
00:09:17,139 --> 00:09:18,516
was because she
wanted to be with

196
00:09:18,517 --> 00:09:20,687
her drama school
sweetheart, Mimi Pollak.

197
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:24,170
- Convenient.

198
00:09:24,172 --> 00:09:26,274
- This is what you wanted.

199
00:09:26,275 --> 00:09:28,205
So, what do you expect?

200
00:09:29,689 --> 00:09:32,619
I wasn't trying to make
things hard for you.

201
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:34,000
I didn't want to like you.

202
00:09:35,137 --> 00:09:36,307
But I couldn't help it.

203
00:09:37,448 --> 00:09:39,718
You just came into my life, and

204
00:09:39,724 --> 00:09:41,205
then, we just--

205
00:09:41,206 --> 00:09:43,026
- Made sense.

206
00:09:43,034 --> 00:09:44,454
- Now here's the tall order.

207
00:09:45,724 --> 00:09:47,171
Go to her, Molly.

208
00:09:47,172 --> 00:09:48,342
- I can't.

209
00:09:48,344 --> 00:09:50,144
You've seen her social media.

210
00:09:50,145 --> 00:09:51,997
She's moved on.

211
00:09:53,482 --> 00:09:57,240
- Are you sure about that?

212
00:10:24,896 --> 00:10:29,896
♪ Suddenly I've been
caught up in a wind ♪

213
00:10:30,517 --> 00:10:31,307
♪ Maybe

214
00:10:32,759 --> 00:10:33,588
- Molly.

215
00:10:34,551 --> 00:10:35,521
What?

216
00:10:35,522 --> 00:10:37,027
Babe this is my room, remember?

217
00:10:37,034 --> 00:10:39,033
- I needed it, where were you?

218
00:10:39,034 --> 00:10:40,144
- I was with Jake.

219
00:10:40,145 --> 00:10:41,757
He walked me home and...

220
00:10:44,724 --> 00:10:46,174
Oh my god, where are the rest?

221
00:10:49,068 --> 00:10:51,098
Buddy, no.
- That's not all.

222
00:10:52,034 --> 00:10:53,654
I

223
00:10:53,655 --> 00:10:55,135
came out to my mom.

224
00:10:55,137 --> 00:10:57,717
- What? Yes.

225
00:10:57,724 --> 00:10:58,974
How did she take it?

226
00:10:58,975 --> 00:11:00,585
- Absolutely fine.

227
00:11:00,586 --> 00:11:02,236
- I knew she would,
Meredith is the best.

228
00:11:02,241 --> 00:11:03,341
- It

229
00:11:03,344 --> 00:11:04,524
wasn't about her.

230
00:11:05,724 --> 00:11:10,414
I wasn't ready to be
a different person.

231
00:11:11,137 --> 00:11:12,757
Officially, in her eyes.

232
00:11:12,758 --> 00:11:14,447
- You're not a different person.

233
00:11:14,448 --> 00:11:17,548
- Doesn't matter, she
hijacked the conversation

234
00:11:17,551 --> 00:11:21,721
by telling me that my parents
are other people.

235
00:11:21,724 --> 00:11:22,999
- What?

236
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,999
- I think they do it together.

237
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,274
Are they swingers?

238
00:11:27,275 --> 00:11:28,545
Or is it

239
00:11:28,551 --> 00:11:29,999
group sex?

240
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,550
Or sex parties?

241
00:11:32,551 --> 00:11:34,654
- Meredith really is the best.

242
00:11:34,655 --> 00:11:35,585
Sorry.

243
00:11:35,586 --> 00:11:36,896
I mean yikes, sorry.

244
00:11:38,034 --> 00:11:39,834
They probably do it
very respectfully.

245
00:11:39,835 --> 00:11:41,787
- Yeah, I guess they are.

246
00:11:41,793 --> 00:11:43,550
- Respectful swingers.

247
00:11:43,551 --> 00:11:45,447
- Just burn my brain.

248
00:11:45,448 --> 00:11:46,585
- Welcome.

249
00:11:46,586 --> 00:11:47,376
It's hell.

250
00:11:48,724 --> 00:11:50,831
My mom has had three
UTIs this month.

251
00:11:50,832 --> 00:11:51,927
Oh, why do I know that?

252
00:11:52,827 --> 00:11:54,097
- Can I sleep here tonight?

253
00:11:54,103 --> 00:11:55,619
- Yeah you can.

254
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:58,720
Oh man, get ready for
the snuggle of your life.

255
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:06,412
Hey so I was thinking

256
00:12:06,413 --> 00:12:08,073
Jake's probably
just down the street

257
00:12:08,074 --> 00:12:12,308
and I was hoping that you
might be down for a threesome?

258
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Just like your orgy-loving mom?

259
00:12:23,379 --> 00:12:25,239
- Way too soon.

260
00:12:25,241 --> 00:12:26,516
- Come on.

261
00:12:26,517 --> 00:12:27,517
- No.
- Orgies basically

262
00:12:27,518 --> 00:12:29,997
run in your family now.

263
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,170
It'll be so fun.

1
00:00:14,517 --> 00:00:17,205
- I'm sorry, mom.

2
00:00:17,206 --> 00:00:18,026
I'm sorry.

3
00:00:27,482 --> 00:00:28,312
- Hi!

4
00:00:28,313 --> 00:00:29,826
- Jesus.

5
00:00:29,827 --> 00:00:32,477
- I prefer goddess, but
you're in the right vein.

6
00:00:32,482 --> 00:00:34,757
You, my bear, are
going to work today.

7
00:00:35,724 --> 00:00:37,382
- We're winners in this family

8
00:00:37,383 --> 00:00:39,967
and your kids are relying
on your brilliant brain.

9
00:00:39,968 --> 00:00:41,715
Plus, you can't
afford to get fired.

10
00:00:41,724 --> 00:00:45,067
I know this because
you still owe me rent.

11
00:00:45,068 --> 00:00:46,028
- Oh, fuck.

12
00:00:46,034 --> 00:00:47,136
I'm so sorry.

13
00:00:47,137 --> 00:00:48,027
I've been

14
00:00:48,034 --> 00:00:49,004
- Sick.

15
00:00:49,005 --> 00:00:50,619
I know, it's completely fine.

16
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:51,450
- I'm getting up.

17
00:00:51,451 --> 00:00:52,654
- Good.

18
00:00:57,310 --> 00:01:00,067
Hey, papa, what's going on?

19
00:01:00,068 --> 00:01:01,928
- She sent the
divorce papers already.

20
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,340
- That was fucking fast.

21
00:01:05,344 --> 00:01:06,834
- Do you think
she wants to marry him?

22
00:01:06,835 --> 00:01:08,274
Do you think that's why?

23
00:01:08,275 --> 00:01:09,445
- She does not want to
marry him, he's an idiot.

24
00:01:09,448 --> 00:01:11,447
- She said
she's in love with him.

25
00:01:11,448 --> 00:01:14,618
I, I, I thought she just needed
to get it out of her system,

26
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:17,170
but I'd, I'd take
her back, Elle.

27
00:01:17,172 --> 00:01:18,102
I don't care?

28
00:01:18,103 --> 00:01:18,933
- Dad, are you at the cottage?

29
00:01:18,934 --> 00:01:19,999
- Just, yeah.

30
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:20,828
- Okay, I'll talk to her.

31
00:01:20,829 --> 00:01:21,757
Okay?

32
00:01:21,758 --> 00:01:22,928
- Honey, you can't.

33
00:01:22,931 --> 00:01:24,378
- Can and I will.

34
00:01:24,379 --> 00:01:25,207
I'll talk to her.

35
00:01:25,208 --> 00:01:26,026
I'll call you later.

36
00:01:26,034 --> 00:01:26,902
Okay?

37
00:01:26,903 --> 00:01:27,716
I love you.

38
00:01:28,862 --> 00:01:31,032
- I don't...

39
00:01:56,793 --> 00:01:57,964
- Miss. Phillips?

40
00:01:57,965 --> 00:01:59,065
- Yes?

41
00:01:59,068 --> 00:02:00,928
- I'm happy you're back.

42
00:02:00,931 --> 00:02:02,341
- Thanks, Sarah.

43
00:02:02,344 --> 00:02:06,414
Um, that cold going around
was, was really bad.

44
00:02:07,758 --> 00:02:08,998
- I am too, you know.

45
00:02:10,793 --> 00:02:11,861
- What?

46
00:02:11,862 --> 00:02:12,762
- I am too.

47
00:02:16,862 --> 00:02:21,862
- H-h-have you been able
to talk to anyone else?

48
00:02:23,275 --> 00:02:24,825
D-d-do you feel supported
by the adults in your life?

49
00:02:25,724 --> 00:02:27,792
- You're jokes, Miss Phillips.

50
00:02:27,793 --> 00:02:30,483
Hit me up in the Dm's if
you ever need to chat.

51
00:02:30,484 --> 00:02:31,722
- That's not appropriate.

52
00:02:31,724 --> 00:02:32,624
- See you tomorrow.

53
00:02:32,625 --> 00:02:34,516
- I'll see you tomorrow.

54
00:02:55,206 --> 00:02:56,026
- Ellie.

55
00:02:56,034 --> 00:02:57,550
You're here before 10AM.

56
00:02:57,551 --> 00:02:58,411
Good for you.

57
00:02:58,413 --> 00:02:59,654
- Yeah, thanks.

58
00:02:59,655 --> 00:03:00,895
- So there's a...

59
00:03:00,896 --> 00:03:01,686
- Meeting in the
conference room at 10.

60
00:03:01,689 --> 00:03:02,689
I read the calendar.

61
00:03:03,689 --> 00:03:05,339
- Amazing.

62
00:03:05,344 --> 00:03:06,174
You're really.

63
00:03:07,275 --> 00:03:10,654
On the new client
acquisition, well done.

64
00:03:10,655 --> 00:03:11,475
- In no world.

65
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:19,620
- Maybe just a little brush.

66
00:03:26,034 --> 00:03:27,619
- Oh, what the fuck?

67
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:30,136
- Thank you all for being here.

68
00:03:30,137 --> 00:03:32,097
Especially you, Hunter.

69
00:03:32,103 --> 00:03:33,378
You're such a good support.

70
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:34,207
- Stop it.

71
00:03:34,208 --> 00:03:35,096
- No, you are.

72
00:03:35,103 --> 00:03:36,343
- Oh!

73
00:03:36,344 --> 00:03:38,243
- Okay, so time
is money, people.

74
00:03:38,244 --> 00:03:39,311
Whatever that is.

75
00:03:43,862 --> 00:03:47,619
- "Everyone is smarter
than one of us is smart."

76
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:50,100
The corporate
genius, Bruce Talbot.

77
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:54,170
Today, we're gonna develop

78
00:03:54,172 --> 00:03:57,999
communication and management
skills using truth serum.

79
00:03:58,971 --> 00:04:00,855
Just Kidding. It's role play.

80
00:04:00,862 --> 00:04:02,382
Which is almost the same thing.

81
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:05,999
So, let's win

82
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
together!

83
00:04:10,206 --> 00:04:11,026
Cut.

84
00:04:14,482 --> 00:04:16,552
Oh, uh, Guds from
I.T. helped me.

85
00:04:16,553 --> 00:04:17,621
I'll talk to him later.

86
00:04:17,622 --> 00:04:18,790
- Wow.

87
00:04:18,793 --> 00:04:21,412
- So, I am hoping

88
00:04:21,413 --> 00:04:22,763
to bring these exercises

89
00:04:22,764 --> 00:04:25,964
to the rest of the team
if this is successful.

90
00:04:25,965 --> 00:04:27,445
You're my guinea pigs.

91
00:04:27,448 --> 00:04:31,826
- I-Can I just say that
we all have room to grow.

92
00:04:31,827 --> 00:04:34,997
And exemplary work.

93
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,170
Wow.

94
00:04:36,172 --> 00:04:40,032
- Aw, this one is called
"Winners, losers."

95
00:04:40,034 --> 00:04:44,757
The goal is to reframe
negative situations

96
00:04:44,758 --> 00:04:48,098
into learning
experiences as a team.

97
00:04:48,103 --> 00:04:49,033
- Great.

98
00:04:49,034 --> 00:04:49,972
So, I'm a lone wolf, Patty.

99
00:04:49,973 --> 00:04:50,895
- I-I love that.

100
00:04:50,896 --> 00:04:52,716
And I just think that, um

101
00:04:52,724 --> 00:04:56,136
I would love to make
our new winter ale

102
00:04:56,137 --> 00:04:57,307
and name it after you.

103
00:04:57,310 --> 00:04:58,480
And it's just gonna be called

104
00:04:58,482 --> 00:04:59,412
Liquid sex.

105
00:04:59,413 --> 00:05:00,723
- Oh, my god.

106
00:05:00,724 --> 00:05:02,384
- And your face
is gonna be on it.

107
00:05:02,385 --> 00:05:06,339
Like how sensational
would that be?

108
00:05:07,315 --> 00:05:09,309
- That's so good, thank you.

109
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:10,720
- Great, so I hate that idea.

110
00:05:10,724 --> 00:05:12,723
I'm gonna go do
some actual work.

111
00:05:12,724 --> 00:05:14,034
As a winner I have...

112
00:05:16,244 --> 00:05:18,205
- Oh, my god.

113
00:05:18,206 --> 00:05:23,206
- Oh, my god.

114
00:05:23,896 --> 00:05:24,716
- Oh, my god.

115
00:05:24,724 --> 00:05:25,664
- Lunch, anyone.

116
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:27,620
- Oh.

117
00:05:27,621 --> 00:05:29,170
- Oof.

118
00:05:29,172 --> 00:05:30,242
- She didn't make it.

119
00:05:46,586 --> 00:05:48,306
- Wow, you weren't the
one I was expecting.

120
00:05:49,206 --> 00:05:50,206
- I know.

121
00:05:50,206 --> 00:05:51,026
I've just

122
00:05:51,034 --> 00:05:52,344
- You've been busy.

123
00:05:53,551 --> 00:05:55,688
- No, not even a little bit.

124
00:05:55,689 --> 00:05:59,654
I just didn't know if you'd
want me to call, and...

125
00:05:59,655 --> 00:06:00,655
- 'Course I do.

126
00:06:00,656 --> 00:06:02,515
We're still friends, aren't we?

127
00:06:02,517 --> 00:06:03,447
- Good.

128
00:06:03,448 --> 00:06:05,308
I want to tell you something.

129
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:09,136
Um, I've been telling
people about us.

130
00:06:09,137 --> 00:06:10,997
My parents.

131
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:11,860
- Oh.

132
00:06:13,862 --> 00:06:14,692
Wow.

133
00:06:14,693 --> 00:06:15,964
- You have no idea.

134
00:06:15,965 --> 00:06:19,995
Um, a kid came out to
me at school, I think.

135
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,480
And I just feel stupid for
making it so complicated.

136
00:06:26,448 --> 00:06:28,447
- Well, I'm glad you
feel good about it now.

137
00:06:29,279 --> 00:06:30,445
- I wanna see you.

138
00:06:35,413 --> 00:06:36,757
- What are you doing?

139
00:06:36,758 --> 00:06:37,588
- What?

140
00:06:38,517 --> 00:06:40,547
- Molly, I wanna
be there for ya.

141
00:06:40,551 --> 00:06:44,964
I do, but this, this fucking
back and forth thing.

142
00:06:44,965 --> 00:06:46,235
You can't just.

143
00:06:46,241 --> 00:06:47,411
You know you can't just.

144
00:06:47,413 --> 00:06:49,623
- I'm trying. Like
this is all new for me.

145
00:06:49,624 --> 00:06:51,585
And I just, I.

146
00:06:51,586 --> 00:06:53,096
- I can't do this again.

147
00:06:54,206 --> 00:06:55,026
- Oh.

148
00:06:56,344 --> 00:06:57,516
Uh, yeah.

149
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,100
Sorry, uh, the kids need
help, after school study.

150
00:07:01,103 --> 00:07:01,971
- Molly, I'm sorry.

151
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:13,760
Knock, knock.

152
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:15,860
How's the tummy?

153
00:07:17,241 --> 00:07:18,071
- It's fine.

154
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:23,340
Um, like, we, we
really need to talk.

155
00:07:24,551 --> 00:07:26,589
- That is just what I
was thinking, my love.

156
00:07:26,590 --> 00:07:28,206
Shall we get a glass of wine?

157
00:07:29,275 --> 00:07:30,405
- Oh, uh, yeah.

158
00:07:30,413 --> 00:07:31,211
Yes.

159
00:07:31,212 --> 00:07:32,026
Okay.

160
00:07:32,034 --> 00:07:32,904
- It's just...

161
00:07:34,344 --> 00:07:37,214
I know how difficult it's been
having to play guessing games

162
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:38,654
and

163
00:07:38,655 --> 00:07:40,685
- Yeah, and you're filing
for divorce already.

164
00:07:40,689 --> 00:07:41,517
- You spoke to your father?

165
00:07:41,518 --> 00:07:42,337
- Yeah, my father.

166
00:07:42,344 --> 00:07:43,174
My father.

167
00:07:43,175 --> 00:07:45,102
It's my dad, Roger.

168
00:07:45,103 --> 00:07:46,757
You're partner for 30 years.

169
00:07:46,758 --> 00:07:47,688
- Honey.

170
00:07:47,689 --> 00:07:49,309
- He's a mess, by the way.

171
00:07:52,137 --> 00:07:54,585
- Let's get that
glass of wine, okay.

172
00:07:54,586 --> 00:07:55,516
We'll talk.

173
00:07:55,517 --> 00:07:56,964
I don't want to do this here.

174
00:07:56,965 --> 00:07:57,965
Okay, sweetheart?

175
00:07:58,862 --> 00:07:59,830
- Okay.

176
00:07:59,831 --> 00:08:00,657
Great.

177
00:08:18,344 --> 00:08:21,757
- God take me.

178
00:08:21,758 --> 00:08:23,688
Champagne, pink.

179
00:08:23,689 --> 00:08:24,999
- Oh, she's fancy, huh.

180
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,280
- Yeah, mom's paying, so.

181
00:08:27,275 --> 00:08:28,205
- Behave.

182
00:08:28,206 --> 00:08:28,964
- No, I'm fine, I'm fine.

183
00:08:28,965 --> 00:08:29,965
I just, I, um.

184
00:08:29,966 --> 00:08:30,995
I just.

185
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,480
I thought that.

186
00:08:32,482 --> 00:08:33,722
You know what, never mind.

187
00:08:33,724 --> 00:08:35,964
Uh, I just need a
drink, and a minute.

188
00:08:35,965 --> 00:08:36,785
- Okay.

189
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:40,964
- Is Jake around?

190
00:08:40,965 --> 00:08:42,715
- He's changing a keg.

191
00:08:42,724 --> 00:08:44,171
- Oh, okay.

192
00:08:44,172 --> 00:08:45,242
- You're all kinds of
everything, right now, eh.

193
00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:49,654
- And what a big day.

194
00:08:49,655 --> 00:08:52,475
You finally get to know
the wonderful Hunter.

195
00:08:53,965 --> 00:08:56,405
- And he gets to know
the wonderful me.

196
00:08:56,413 --> 00:08:58,999
I could just eat
Mr. Wonderful up.

197
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,410
- I did.

198
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:03,860
- Stop.

199
00:09:06,068 --> 00:09:08,718
- MMM, so, um...

200
00:09:08,724 --> 00:09:10,516
You were saying.

201
00:09:10,517 --> 00:09:11,997
- Oh, yeah.

202
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,520
When my buddy and I, when
we left the law firm.

203
00:09:13,521 --> 00:09:14,717
We were both, like,

204
00:09:14,724 --> 00:09:15,692
Ah, what do we
do, what do we do.

205
00:09:15,693 --> 00:09:16,517
And we're like,

206
00:09:16,518 --> 00:09:17,517
we like beer.

207
00:09:17,517 --> 00:09:18,477
I like beer, do you like beer?

208
00:09:18,482 --> 00:09:19,412
And he's like, I like beer.

209
00:09:19,413 --> 00:09:21,343
So, we're like, let's set out.

210
00:09:21,344 --> 00:09:25,619
And we wanted to make like a
real soul of the earth brewery.

211
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:27,067
Yeah?

212
00:09:27,068 --> 00:09:29,998
And so that's exactly how
frisky hops brewery was born.

213
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,100
- Oh, that sounds soul
of the earth all right.

214
00:09:34,103 --> 00:09:35,895
Salt of the earth even.

215
00:09:35,896 --> 00:09:37,205
- Thanks.

216
00:09:37,206 --> 00:09:38,136
- Yeah.

217
00:09:38,137 --> 00:09:39,377
- He's amazing.

218
00:09:39,379 --> 00:09:40,719
- MMM, and legal.

219
00:09:41,896 --> 00:09:45,306
- Oh, don't be ridiculous.

220
00:09:45,310 --> 00:09:46,208
Of course he is.

221
00:09:46,209 --> 00:09:47,206
- Yeah, I'm over 18.

222
00:09:47,206 --> 00:09:48,026
- I wouldn't.

223
00:09:48,034 --> 00:09:49,309
I would never.

224
00:09:49,310 --> 00:09:52,619
- Um, no, because he's
a lawyer, mom, c'mon.

225
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:53,410
Just like dad.

226
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:56,378
- I didn't know your
ex was a lawyer.

227
00:09:56,379 --> 00:09:57,279
- Corporate law.

228
00:09:58,689 --> 00:10:00,479
- Sorry, are we, we're calling
him an ex husband already.

229
00:10:00,482 --> 00:10:01,692
I mean, the bed's still warm.

230
00:10:02,758 --> 00:10:03,588
- Luke warm, right?

231
00:10:03,589 --> 00:10:05,205
It's been two years.

232
00:10:07,413 --> 00:10:12,413
- I am simply dying for a
visit to the little girls room.

233
00:10:13,137 --> 00:10:13,927
- I'll come with you.

234
00:10:13,931 --> 00:10:14,759
- Join me, Elle?

235
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:15,586
- Oh, no.

236
00:10:15,587 --> 00:10:16,406
I'm fine.

237
00:10:16,413 --> 00:10:17,590
I have an iron bladder.

238
00:10:17,591 --> 00:10:19,274
But I'm sure you're
bursting, so.

239
00:10:19,275 --> 00:10:20,095
- Okay.

240
00:10:22,034 --> 00:10:24,074
- Enjoy the fully
adult woman's room.

241
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
- Play nice

242
00:10:32,827 --> 00:10:33,717
- Oh my gosh.

243
00:10:33,724 --> 00:10:34,592
- Hi.

244
00:10:34,593 --> 00:10:35,406
- Oh my god.

245
00:10:35,413 --> 00:10:36,481
Look at this.

246
00:10:36,482 --> 00:10:38,902
Strawberry passion awareness.

247
00:10:40,622 --> 00:10:41,450
- It's champagne.

248
00:10:42,448 --> 00:10:43,276
- Oh, is it.

249
00:10:43,277 --> 00:10:44,275
- Yeah.

250
00:10:44,275 --> 00:10:45,095
I know you're into beer, but.

251
00:10:45,103 --> 00:10:46,378
- Oh, mm-hmm.

252
00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:48,449
Um, your mom tells
me that you've been,

253
00:10:48,450 --> 00:10:50,688
uh, really, like really busy.

254
00:10:50,689 --> 00:10:52,277
Really working
hard, and all that.

255
00:10:52,278 --> 00:10:54,825
- I mean, yes, but
not as hard as you,

256
00:10:54,827 --> 00:10:56,857
you two have been working.

257
00:10:56,862 --> 00:10:57,964
- Oh, c'mon.

258
00:10:57,965 --> 00:10:59,545
- Managing two businesses and

259
00:10:59,551 --> 00:11:01,901
you know, not to mention,
affairs are hard work.

260
00:11:03,206 --> 00:11:04,826
- Wait, what?

261
00:11:04,827 --> 00:11:05,617
- Hmm?

262
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:06,690
- No, no, no, no.

263
00:11:06,691 --> 00:11:07,964
No, No.

264
00:11:07,965 --> 00:11:08,965
Not even.

265
00:11:08,966 --> 00:11:10,995
I-I would never.

266
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Okay.

267
00:11:12,001 --> 00:11:13,619
I'm not having an affair at all.

268
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:15,030
I love your mother.

269
00:11:15,034 --> 00:11:16,414
- Oh, at least
one of you hasn't.

270
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,210
- Hasn't what?

271
00:11:20,758 --> 00:11:23,138

for everyone involved.

no pride left.

342

taking this sharp downturn

What's going on?

49
00:01:58,448 --> 00:02:01,478
- I think we are both
just very stressed,

50
00:02:01,482 --> 00:02:03,002
and we're doing
ourselves a world of good

51
00:02:03,003 --> 00:02:04,930
by taking this little break.

52
00:02:04,931 --> 00:02:06,411
I've read about stress--

53
00:02:06,413 --> 00:02:07,723
- I've heard you say that
a lot but I've actually

54
00:02:07,724 --> 00:02:09,343
never seen you reading.

55
00:02:09,344 --> 00:02:11,274
- I listen to podcasts.

56
00:02:11,275 --> 00:02:14,685
Whatever, college!

57
00:02:14,689 --> 00:02:17,929
- oh my god!
- You don't ever read!

58
00:02:17,931 --> 00:02:21,067
- I read all the time.
- You are so smart.

59
00:02:21,068 --> 00:02:23,998

That is not the
cottage I remember.

68
00:03:00,827 --> 00:03:03,997
Olden days, no internet,
board games, candles.

69
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,930
- Yeah, another upgrade
and party cake went big.

70
00:03:06,931 --> 00:03:11,516
It's fully decked out for
business and pleasure.

71
00:03:11,517 --> 00:03:14,136
- So, what do you wanna do now?

72
00:03:14,137 --> 00:03:15,516

- His car's not here.

76
00:03:20,793 --> 00:03:23,933
- Weird, must've gone to
the stores or something.

77
00:03:23,934 --> 00:03:25,309
- Yeah, probably.

78
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:26,480
Yeah I have a
conference call at one,

79
00:03:26,482 --> 00:03:27,792
and then I'm totally available.

80
00:03:27,793 --> 00:03:31,723
- We just drove for four
hours to your cottage.

81
00:03:31,724 --> 00:03:33,309
It's gorgeous.

82
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:36,067
Your heartbroken dad is
inside, you wanna work?

83
00:03:36,068 --> 00:03:37,548
- Well, yeah, but
I have shit to do.

84
00:03:37,551 --> 00:03:38,551

85
00:03:41,827 --> 00:03:43,717

88
00:03:51,413 --> 00:03:53,102
Are you completely insane?

89
00:03:53,103 --> 00:03:55,483
How are we supposed
to get back now?

90
00:03:55,484 --> 00:03:57,522
- Yes, I did not
think that far ahead.

91
00:03:57,523 --> 00:03:59,307
But, who cares?

00:04:32,517 --> 00:04:34,377
- You're an insane person.

102
00:04:40,344 --> 00:04:42,074
- S'mores are just so

103
00:04:42,075 --> 00:04:44,758
underrated but they're the best.

104
00:04:46,448 --> 00:04:47,278
- Whoa!

105
00:04:49,586 --> 00:04:50,786
Dad?

106
00:04:50,793 --> 00:04:51,623
- Roger?

107
00:04:53,827 --> 00:04:55,137
- What happened?

108
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:00,480
- Look.

109
00:05:02,758 --> 00:05:04,168
- He doesn't even fish.

110
00:05:04,172 --> 00:05:05,999
- Maybe he does now.

111
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:06,860
Call him?

112
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,480
Oh, right.

113
00:05:09,482 --> 00:05:13,067
Well, we are here
maybe we should--

114
00:05:13,068 --> 00:05:16,378
- Yeah, okay I'm just
gonna look outside again.

115
00:05:16,379 --> 00:05:17,209
- Okay.

116
00:05:33,206 --> 00:05:34,026
Roger!

117
00:05:37,034 --> 00:05:37,904
Roger!

118
00:05:40,586 --> 00:05:41,406
Dad!

119
00:06:08,724 --> 00:06:10,343
Well, he's fishing.

120
00:06:10,344 --> 00:06:11,594
The neighbor just told me, so--

121
00:06:11,595 --> 00:06:12,996
- Good!

122
00:06:14,517 --> 00:06:17,207
- Really settling into that
babushka realness, aren't ya?

123
00:06:17,208 --> 00:06:18,716
- I'm living my truth.

124
00:06:18,724 --> 00:06:19,904
- I'm into it.

125
00:06:55,655 --> 00:06:59,655
Oh, fuck it, enough.

126
00:07:02,689 --> 00:07:06,029
I just, I wanna get back to us.

127
00:07:06,034 --> 00:07:09,004
- Me too.

128
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:13,140
- Ah!

129
00:07:14,793 --> 00:07:15,623
I have,

130
00:07:20,689 --> 00:07:21,519
Champagne.

131
00:07:22,724 --> 00:07:25,826
It's dusty, so it
must be expensive.

132
00:07:25,827 --> 00:07:26,997
- Yes, please.

133
00:07:28,344 --> 00:07:30,974
- Did you just have those
on you at all times?

134
00:07:30,975 --> 00:07:33,965
- S'mores.

135
00:07:35,103 --> 00:07:37,378
- Gonna get glasses
for the champagne.

136
00:07:37,379 --> 00:07:38,209
- Okay.

137
00:07:44,586 --> 00:07:46,895
- Why don't you
ever talk about him?

138
00:07:46,896 --> 00:07:47,716
- Oh.

139
00:07:48,758 --> 00:07:51,757
I don't remember him, at all.

140
00:07:51,758 --> 00:07:53,928
My mom never talked
about him, so.

141
00:07:53,931 --> 00:07:57,341
- Aren't you, aren't
you just curious?

142
00:07:57,344 --> 00:07:59,481
To like, see his face?

143
00:07:59,482 --> 00:08:02,722
- Not really I mean
Roger, he's my dad.

144
00:08:06,068 --> 00:08:08,208
And I just, like, why
would I wanna meet somebody

145
00:08:08,209 --> 00:08:11,096
who might look like
me, but never cared?

146
00:08:11,103 --> 00:08:12,516
Just.

147
00:08:17,551 --> 00:08:19,101
Wow, my blood is bad.

148
00:08:19,103 --> 00:08:21,102
- What?

149
00:08:21,103 --> 00:08:22,763
- One parent left and the
other one could literally

150
00:08:22,764 --> 00:08:26,274
not be more selfish,
what does that make me?

151
00:08:26,275 --> 00:08:28,405
- It is not you.
- No, it is me.

152
00:08:28,413 --> 00:08:30,999
- No, it's separate from you.

153
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,520
- We're exactly the same.

154
00:08:32,521 --> 00:08:35,997
Like, I broke up my mom
and that child groom guy.

155
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
No, but they seemed
genuinely happy.

156
00:08:40,931 --> 00:08:43,661
Anyway, your turn,
tell me about,

157
00:08:45,241 --> 00:08:46,757
what is her name?

158
00:08:46,758 --> 00:08:49,964
You never told me her
name, what's her name?

159
00:08:52,586 --> 00:08:54,306
- She's just the one.

160
00:08:55,896 --> 00:08:57,996
- So how did you guys meet?

161
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,240
I mean, I heard
about the breakup

162
00:09:00,241 --> 00:09:03,031
but I wanna hear the good stuff.

163
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,170
- Fit.

164
00:09:09,172 --> 00:09:12,067
- Oh, I've been
going hard at the gym

165
00:09:12,068 --> 00:09:14,518
trying to shake that jet lag.

166
00:09:16,068 --> 00:09:18,654
- You American?
- Canadian.

167
00:09:18,655 --> 00:09:21,274
- Oh, sorry.

168
00:09:21,275 --> 00:09:23,515
You're new here?
- Yeah.

169
00:09:24,896 --> 00:09:27,856
There aren't a lotta teaching
jobs where I'm from, so.

170
00:09:27,862 --> 00:09:29,102
- Weird.
- Yeah.

171
00:09:31,275 --> 00:09:32,685
- Well, lucky us.

172
00:09:35,896 --> 00:09:37,585
Teach french?

173
00:09:37,586 --> 00:09:38,406
- Yep

174
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:41,999
- Cool.

175
00:09:45,034 --> 00:09:46,930
See you around.

176
00:09:46,931 --> 00:09:47,761
- Okay.

177
00:09:59,724 --> 00:10:03,214
Bye.

178
00:10:05,965 --> 00:10:09,545
- All the blood, all the
blood, rushed to my face and I

179
00:10:09,551 --> 00:10:14,551
stop laughing and
my head got all foggy and then,

180
00:10:15,655 --> 00:10:18,335
it just sort of
snowballed from there.

181
00:10:18,344 --> 00:10:21,136
- Could you pass
me my housecoat?

182
00:10:21,137 --> 00:10:22,547
- Your housecoat?

183
00:10:23,931 --> 00:10:25,067
- Mhm.

184
00:10:25,068 --> 00:10:28,378
- That's actually
called a dressing gown.

185
00:10:28,379 --> 00:10:30,449
- Your colonial
aggression is showing.

186
00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:31,998
- My what?

187
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,170
- Just a little passive-aggressive
moments British people

188
00:10:34,172 --> 00:10:36,861
have because they're not the
center of the world anymore.

189
00:10:36,862 --> 00:10:38,102
- Oh.

190
00:10:38,103 --> 00:10:38,933
Ah, I see.

191
00:10:40,344 --> 00:10:44,864
Well the thing is, you lot just
don't say things correctly.

192
00:10:46,034 --> 00:10:47,074
When you see a small
dog on the street,

193
00:10:47,075 --> 00:10:48,308
you will say something like,

194
00:10:48,310 --> 00:10:51,170
"Oh hey look at that
weiner dog, eh."

195
00:10:52,379 --> 00:10:55,479
- Like, sausage
dog is any better?

196
00:10:55,482 --> 00:10:58,999
- It's correct.
- I'm happy I'm going home.

197
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,309
Sick of you people.

198
00:11:01,310 --> 00:11:02,590
- I don't know.

199
00:11:03,931 --> 00:11:05,550
Well,

200
00:11:05,551 --> 00:11:07,831
maybe I'll come to Toronto.

201
00:11:09,275 --> 00:11:10,335
- Oh!

202
00:11:12,862 --> 00:11:14,522
- I really like you.

203
00:11:17,931 --> 00:11:21,691
Let's go Blue Jays!

204
00:11:25,965 --> 00:11:27,825
- I've never seen you like this.

205
00:11:27,827 --> 00:11:30,927
It's like, not
once, not one time.

206
00:11:34,862 --> 00:11:36,826
- It's just chemicals.

207
00:11:36,827 --> 00:11:38,237
- What?

208
00:11:38,241 --> 00:11:41,761
- She and I, we're very
close for a six month period,

209
00:11:41,762 --> 00:11:45,548
and this mix of dopamine,
serotonin, oxytocin,

210
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:50,826
there's one I'm
forgetting, endorphins!

211
00:11:50,827 --> 00:11:52,687
Just flooded my system.

212
00:11:54,172 --> 00:11:57,072
How could she get
over me, so fast?

213
00:12:01,275 --> 00:12:02,785
And I am detoxing.

214
00:12:04,068 --> 00:12:05,238
I've read all,

215
00:12:07,172 --> 00:12:08,309
I do read.

216
00:12:12,758 --> 00:12:15,278
- You know what, I've
heard all that shit before.

217
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:17,515
- Mhm.
- I don't buy it.

218
00:12:17,517 --> 00:12:18,337
- Mhm.

219
00:12:19,551 --> 00:12:22,309
- If she is your person,
then she's your person.

220
00:12:22,310 --> 00:12:23,140
The end.

221
00:12:24,206 --> 00:12:25,026
That's it.

222
00:12:28,103 --> 00:12:30,003
- Since when are you a romantic?

223
00:12:30,004 --> 00:12:31,999
- Oh my god, I'm not.

224
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,585
I'm not!

225
00:12:34,413 --> 00:12:35,483
- Ew.
- Okay.

226
00:12:36,344 --> 00:12:40,004
So, how's Barback?

227
00:12:42,724 --> 00:12:44,312
- Well, he's a
bartender and musician.

228
00:12:44,313 --> 00:12:47,410
- Oh I am very sorry.
- We're buddies, whatever.

229
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,274
If I wanted to bang that
guy I'd know, I would.

230
00:12:53,275 --> 00:12:54,335
- Would you?
- Yes!

231
00:12:54,344 --> 00:12:56,688
- Would you?
- Yes.

232
00:12:56,689 --> 00:12:57,899
You know what I
want at all times.

233
00:12:57,900 --> 00:12:59,096
- Mm.

234
00:12:59,103 --> 00:13:02,895
- Every second of every
day, like right now.

235
00:13:02,896 --> 00:13:04,516
I'm gonna swim.

236
00:13:04,517 --> 00:13:06,067
- No.
- Yes.

237
00:13:06,068 --> 00:13:07,208
- No.
- Yes, I am.

238
00:13:07,209 --> 00:13:09,546
- No you're not.
- Uh-huh.

239
00:13:09,551 --> 00:13:11,070
Polar bear, polar bear!

240
00:13:11,071 --> 00:13:13,588
- It is zero degrees outside!
- I don't care, polar bear!

241
00:13:13,589 --> 00:13:14,786
- Elle!

242
00:13:14,793 --> 00:13:16,999
Elle, the lake is frozen!

243
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,999
- I'm gonna get
those fucking keys!

Coffee is ready.

3
00:00:39,068 --> 00:00:40,928
- I don't wanna go back.

4
00:00:40,931 --> 00:00:42,481
- Aw!

5
00:00:42,482 --> 00:00:45,205
Don't worry, I
will fight whoever.

6
00:00:45,206 --> 00:00:46,236
I'll do it.

7
00:00:46,241 --> 00:00:49,826
Teachers, kids, I got you.

8
00:00:49,827 --> 00:00:51,547
I'm an accomplished
match-breaker.

9
00:00:51,551 --> 00:00:53,411
- I'm sure you
didn't break them up,

10
00:00:53,413 --> 00:00:56,067
it just ran its course.

11
00:00:56,068 --> 00:00:57,378
- Give me some credit.

12
00:00:57,379 --> 00:00:58,619
I mean, young, dumb Hunter

13
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:00,450
didn't even know that
he was a mistress.

14
00:01:00,451 --> 00:01:03,408
What is the male
equivalent for mistress?

15
00:01:03,413 --> 00:01:04,516
- Uh, master?

16
00:01:04,517 --> 00:01:05,447
- No.

17
00:01:05,448 --> 00:01:07,826
Anyway, she lied to everyone,

18
00:01:07,827 --> 00:01:09,787
and I just like, helped
him see the light.

19
00:01:09,793 --> 00:01:10,930
- You what?

20
00:01:10,931 --> 00:01:13,895
- Oh my God, you
should've seen his face.

21
00:01:13,896 --> 00:01:15,026
- You are really getting over

22
00:01:15,034 --> 00:01:16,933
the guilt part of that quickly.

23
00:01:16,934 --> 00:01:18,141
- Yeah, with distance--

24
00:01:18,142 --> 00:01:19,377
- One night.

25
00:01:19,379 --> 00:01:20,829
- Comes perspective,
and I decided that

26
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:23,516
after what she
did to our family,

27
00:01:23,517 --> 00:01:24,547
they had it coming.

28
00:01:24,551 --> 00:01:25,381
- But...

29
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:32,140
Hunter didn't, he didn't
know it was an affair.

30
00:01:33,275 --> 00:01:35,335
- Okay, you don't
know about this, okay?

31
00:01:35,344 --> 00:01:36,590
- No, I don't, but--

32
00:01:36,591 --> 00:01:38,276
- Then, you don't
get to weigh in.

33
00:01:39,448 --> 00:01:42,895
- I will absolutely
stop weighing in.

34
00:01:42,896 --> 00:01:44,656
I just don't want
that kind of help.

35
00:01:46,655 --> 00:01:47,655
- Well, congratulations.

36
00:01:47,656 --> 00:01:48,755
That's very mature.

37
00:01:50,965 --> 00:01:53,895
I'm saying that I get to
act however the fuck I want,

38
00:01:53,896 --> 00:01:54,856
that's what I think.

39
00:01:54,862 --> 00:01:58,171
- I I am barely awake.

40
00:01:58,172 --> 00:01:59,002
I...

41
00:02:00,724 --> 00:02:02,243
I care about you
and your family,

42
00:02:02,244 --> 00:02:05,209
I just think that continuing
to hurt each other

43
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:06,996
isn't gonna lead anywhere good.

44
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,660
- You know what, you don't
know anything about my life.

45
00:02:08,661 --> 00:02:10,715
You called me once in two years.

46
00:02:10,724 --> 00:02:12,904
- I said I was sorry.

47
00:02:13,931 --> 00:02:15,136
I am sorry!

48
00:02:15,137 --> 00:02:17,097
But, I'm here now, and
you're just too busy

49
00:02:17,103 --> 00:02:19,863
with this geriatric "Parent
Trap" scheme to care.

50
00:02:22,413 --> 00:02:24,622
- At least I'm trying
to do something.

51
00:02:24,623 --> 00:02:27,280
Like, anything, about this
shit pile that I'm in!

52
00:02:27,281 --> 00:02:29,165
- I'm doing something!

53
00:02:29,172 --> 00:02:31,205
I just don't work like you.

54
00:02:31,206 --> 00:02:33,406
I can't solve my problems by

55
00:02:33,413 --> 00:02:36,553
simultaneously filling
all of my holes.

56
00:02:38,034 --> 00:02:40,004
- If you have a problem
with my lifestyle--

57
00:02:40,005 --> 00:02:43,170
- My only problem is
that it took you until

58
00:02:43,172 --> 00:02:45,999
last night to actually
ask me about her.

59
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,274
- Oh, my God!

60
00:02:47,275 --> 00:02:48,585
You also could've
brought her up!

61
00:02:48,586 --> 00:02:50,926
What, I have to fucking
ask you everything now?

62
00:02:50,931 --> 00:02:53,550
- I have, I've tried to talk,
it's like you don't notice.

63
00:02:53,551 --> 00:02:54,381
- When?

64
00:02:54,382 --> 00:02:55,654
- So--

65
00:02:55,655 --> 00:02:57,165
- Okay, yeah, we don't
all have the luxury

66
00:02:57,172 --> 00:02:59,552
of like, staying home sick
from work to chat all day--

67
00:02:59,553 --> 00:03:01,521
- I was suspended from school.

68
00:03:02,482 --> 00:03:03,930
I wasn't sick.

69
00:03:03,931 --> 00:03:05,861
I was suspended
in my second week.

70
00:03:07,275 --> 00:03:08,545
- Why didn't you tell me that?

71
00:03:08,551 --> 00:03:11,281
- Because every time I
try to open my mouth,

72
00:03:11,282 --> 00:03:13,925
you have some bigger dilemma

73
00:03:13,931 --> 00:03:16,585
that needs to be
talked into the ground!

74
00:03:16,586 --> 00:03:17,406
- My dilemma?

75
00:03:20,586 --> 00:03:22,996
It's a little bigger
than a dilemma.

76
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,930
My family will never
be my family again.

77
00:03:25,931 --> 00:03:28,309
Your family loves you so much

78
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:29,790
that they are dying
to connect with you,

79
00:03:29,793 --> 00:03:31,833
and you're the one
who's running away.

80
00:03:31,834 --> 00:03:34,407
I don't wanna be
friends with someone

81
00:03:34,413 --> 00:03:36,761
who can't even realize
how lucky they are.

82
00:03:36,762 --> 00:03:38,788
- I don't think I wanna
be friends with somebody

83
00:03:38,793 --> 00:03:40,723
who can't handle it when
I'm calling them out

84
00:03:40,724 --> 00:03:42,974
because they've
been being a cunt!

85
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:46,590
- Okay, England, we
don't say that word here.

86
00:03:46,591 --> 00:03:47,826
And you know what?

87
00:03:47,827 --> 00:03:48,757
Friends are supposed
to support each other,

88
00:03:48,758 --> 00:03:50,208
even if they're being a cunt.

89
00:03:51,413 --> 00:03:52,243
- No.

90
00:03:54,793 --> 00:03:56,173
- Fuck this.

91
00:03:58,137 --> 00:04:02,237
- Hey, where, where are you...

92
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:04,447

Jesus Christ.

98
00:04:13,103 --> 00:04:13,933
Oh, my God.

No.

No, no, no, no!

The reception, I've
been gone for one day.

124
00:05:56,827 --> 00:05:59,207
I really don't wanna
talk about that.

125

Listen, I know I said I

Okay, thanks, Mom.

128
00:06:09,413 --> 00:06:11,930
Elle split up
Patricia and that guy

129

132
00:06:21,206 --> 00:06:22,066
- Nothing at all.

133
00:06:24,034 --> 00:06:26,447
She's very protective of you.

134
00:06:26,448 --> 00:06:30,028
- Yeah, so, that worked.

135
00:06:30,034 --> 00:06:31,274
- I guess.

136
00:06:35,034 --> 00:06:36,384

So does cottage Roger.

138
00:06:39,172 --> 00:06:41,481
I've never seen
you so laid-back.

139
00:06:41,482 --> 00:06:45,452
- Yeah, it uh, looks
good on you, too.

140
00:06:47,344 --> 00:06:48,757
- I will wash it.

141
00:06:48,758 --> 00:06:49,928
I will wash it.

142
00:06:51,724 --> 00:06:53,974
Did you catch any fish?

143
00:06:54,931 --> 00:06:57,411
- Zip, but that's okay.

144
00:06:57,413 --> 00:07:01,412
I spent so much time trying
to keep up with Trish

145
00:07:01,413 --> 00:07:04,381
that I forgot just how much
I love being in nature.

146
00:07:04,382 --> 00:07:05,967
- I couldn't agree more.

147
00:07:05,968 --> 00:07:07,095
I went phoneless recently,

148
00:07:07,103 --> 00:07:09,343
and it is really helping
my stress levels.

149
00:07:10,275 --> 00:07:11,165
- Sounded like it.

150
00:07:12,931 --> 00:07:14,450
- Okay, I'm full of shit.

151
00:07:14,451 --> 00:07:16,998
Getting rid of your phone does
not get rid of your problems.

152
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,205
- Neither does eating,
or drinking, or...

153
00:07:21,206 --> 00:07:23,026
Avoiding everybody in your life.

154
00:07:23,034 --> 00:07:24,205
I tried.

155
00:07:24,206 --> 00:07:25,306
- Those were my next steps,

156
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:27,000
so that is really discouraging.

157
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:31,690
- All my issues are
public knowledge now.

158
00:07:32,724 --> 00:07:34,284
It's your turn, it's only fair.

159
00:07:35,586 --> 00:07:37,236
- It's just a breakup.

160
00:07:37,241 --> 00:07:38,171
- Yeah, that's my forte.

161
00:07:38,172 --> 00:07:39,002
Spill.

162
00:07:42,344 --> 00:07:43,244
- You sure?

163
00:07:43,245 --> 00:07:44,826
- Mhm.

164
00:07:47,034 --> 00:07:49,792
- I had my heart broken

165
00:07:49,793 --> 00:07:50,763
by a woman.

166
00:07:53,344 --> 00:07:55,214
Which is a first for me, Rodge.

167
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:59,280
Tried to talk to my
gay friends about it

168
00:07:59,281 --> 00:08:01,375
and they don't get it.

169
00:08:02,655 --> 00:08:03,995
Talked to my straight friends,

170
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,100
and I just feel alone.

171
00:08:07,103 --> 00:08:10,550
Finally get the courage
to come out to my parents,

172
00:08:10,551 --> 00:08:12,481
and it's meaningless, why?

173
00:08:12,482 --> 00:08:14,930
Because their sex
life is freakier

174
00:08:14,931 --> 00:08:17,341
than anything I
could be capable of.

175
00:08:17,344 --> 00:08:18,723
- You didn't know that?

176
00:08:18,724 --> 00:08:19,964
- You did?

177
00:08:19,965 --> 00:08:20,995
- Sorry, we were
talking about you.

178
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:21,830
Go on.

179
00:08:24,551 --> 00:08:25,381
- I...

180
00:08:26,448 --> 00:08:28,378
I didn't know what I wanted,

181
00:08:28,379 --> 00:08:29,479
and now it's too late.

182
00:08:30,655 --> 00:08:32,305
But really, she lives
there, I live here,

183
00:08:32,310 --> 00:08:33,690
there's no point in our lives

184
00:08:33,691 --> 00:08:36,719
getting all fucked up
over some dopamine hit.

185
00:08:36,724 --> 00:08:40,244
I mean, when it's right,
it should feel easy.

186
00:08:43,448 --> 00:08:48,168
- Getting a three-year-old
when I wasn't ready to be a dad

187
00:08:48,172 --> 00:08:49,212
was not easy.

188
00:08:51,827 --> 00:08:54,895
My new wife, working constantly,

189
00:08:54,896 --> 00:08:58,406
and still feeling like
she wasn't doing enough,

190
00:08:58,413 --> 00:08:59,623
was not easy.

191
00:09:01,586 --> 00:09:03,516
And yet, I was really happy,

192
00:09:03,517 --> 00:09:06,307
just being the one trying
to make it easier on them.

193
00:09:11,172 --> 00:09:13,412
If I could've found
anybody else, I would've.

194
00:09:15,068 --> 00:09:16,858
Tricia was my person.

195
00:09:17,793 --> 00:09:18,623
She is my person.

196
00:09:20,103 --> 00:09:21,343
- How do you let her go?

197
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:23,970
- I don't think you do.

198
00:09:26,068 --> 00:09:27,588
I think you just live with it.

199
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,930
Molly,

200
00:09:34,724 --> 00:09:36,004
I don't know how to fish,

201
00:09:38,413 --> 00:09:43,413
and I kept my lure in
that damn water, waiting.

202
00:09:45,586 --> 00:09:46,586
And I realized,

203
00:09:48,517 --> 00:09:50,027
I'm not a person that gives up.

204
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:52,860
I think,

205
00:09:54,931 --> 00:09:56,551
I think you have
to ask yourself,

206
00:09:57,551 --> 00:09:58,791

Oh my God!

10
00:00:38,862 --> 00:00:41,932
- Well, I didn't think anyone
else was gonna be in today.

11
00:00:44,275 --> 00:00:45,235
- Are you okay?

12
00:00:45,241 --> 00:00:46,895
- Oh, yeah.

13
00:00:46,896 --> 00:00:47,716
What are you doing here?

14
00:00:47,724 --> 00:00:48,694
It's Sunday.

15
00:00:48,695 --> 00:00:51,339
- I've got a big client pitch.

16
00:00:51,344 --> 00:00:52,284
Are you...

17
00:00:56,655 --> 00:00:58,205
- Hunter and I broke it off.

18
00:00:59,862 --> 00:01:01,412
I feel like an old fool.

19
00:01:01,413 --> 00:01:03,136
- Screw that guy.

20
00:01:03,137 --> 00:01:04,517
It's okay, okay?

21
00:01:05,724 --> 00:01:07,483
Like I'm sure if you
just talk to Dad...

22
00:01:07,484 --> 00:01:10,072
- I don't wanna work
things out with Roger.

23
00:01:10,073 --> 00:01:11,308
I'm sorry.

24
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:12,860
- Well, he doesn't want
you back either, so...

25
00:01:12,862 --> 00:01:16,930
- Yeah, well, things weren't
working out for a long time.

26
00:01:16,931 --> 00:01:18,240
- I don't care, whatever.

27
00:01:18,241 --> 00:01:19,341
- Honey.

28
00:01:19,344 --> 00:01:20,792
- Why?

29
00:01:20,793 --> 00:01:21,999
There's so many better ways.

30
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,450
Why did you have to
sleep with someone else?

31
00:01:23,451 --> 00:01:25,208
It's so much worse now.

32
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:35,718
- I don't know how to
explain this to you.

33
00:01:36,862 --> 00:01:40,274
I worked my whole
life to be where I am.

34
00:01:40,275 --> 00:01:42,545
- You should have talked to me.

35
00:01:42,551 --> 00:01:44,621
We had lunch every
day last month.

36
00:01:44,622 --> 00:01:45,970
Finding out like that was...

37
00:01:45,971 --> 00:01:48,095
- I was free falling.

38
00:01:48,103 --> 00:01:49,552
I don't know how else to say it.

39
00:01:49,553 --> 00:01:51,861
It felt like this
was my last chance

40
00:01:51,862 --> 00:01:52,832
- That's so selfish.

41
00:01:52,833 --> 00:01:55,857
- To actually find myself again.

42
00:01:55,862 --> 00:01:57,452
- So, take a vacation.

43
00:01:59,034 --> 00:02:00,624
Don't go explode your family.

44
00:02:02,931 --> 00:02:05,240
- I love you so much Elle,
but this is not about you.

45
00:02:05,241 --> 00:02:06,071
I am sorry.

46
00:02:06,072 --> 00:02:07,098
- It should be about me.

47
00:02:08,965 --> 00:02:10,655
- Well, it usually
is, sweetheart.

48
00:02:15,931 --> 00:02:16,761
Meredith.

49
00:02:17,896 --> 00:02:19,476
Yeah, are we on
for dinner tonight?

50
00:02:20,965 --> 00:02:23,785
Oh no, Meredith, I really
don't wanna talk about it.

51
00:02:26,344 --> 00:02:27,174
Okay.

52
00:02:28,689 --> 00:02:29,759
Okay.

53
00:02:31,206 --> 00:02:32,616
Yes, I'm coming.

54
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,688
I have gotta run.

55
00:02:36,689 --> 00:02:38,136
- Are you kidding me?

56
00:02:38,137 --> 00:02:39,337
This is the first time that
we've had an honest conversation

57
00:02:39,344 --> 00:02:40,344
about any of this.

58
00:02:40,345 --> 00:02:41,826
- That was Meredith.

59
00:02:41,827 --> 00:02:43,717
She needs me, she wasn't
making a whole lot of sense.

60
00:02:43,724 --> 00:02:44,834
- I need you.

61
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:50,516
Great, well, I guess I
may as well just work.

62
00:02:50,517 --> 00:02:51,447
Happy Sunday.

63
00:02:54,689 --> 00:02:56,279
- I will call you later.

64
00:02:59,689 --> 00:03:00,519
- What the fuck?

65
00:03:15,034 --> 00:03:18,074
- So, Hunter, why
don't you begin?

66
00:03:20,241 --> 00:03:21,481
- This is not what I...

67
00:03:21,482 --> 00:03:23,002
- Okay, um...

68
00:03:26,551 --> 00:03:27,661
I'd like to begin

69
00:03:29,413 --> 00:03:32,073
with taking a minute.

70
00:03:36,517 --> 00:03:38,067
I didn't know
about your husband.

71
00:03:38,068 --> 00:03:38,928
- Hunter, I-

72
00:03:38,931 --> 00:03:40,447
- You lied to me.

73
00:03:40,448 --> 00:03:43,067
I feel, if I can be
honest with you guys,

74
00:03:43,068 --> 00:03:44,998
I feel like a home wrecker.

75
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,280
And I am not a home wrecker.

76
00:03:46,281 --> 00:03:49,335
I was raised to build
homes, not wreck them.

77
00:03:49,344 --> 00:03:51,454
And I've probably been in
contact with a lot asbestos,

78
00:03:51,455 --> 00:03:55,478
but the point is, I'm
doing as best as I can.

79
00:03:55,482 --> 00:03:58,002
The foundation is integral
and that's what I'm...

80
00:03:58,003 --> 00:03:59,550
I'm a builder for that.

81
00:03:59,551 --> 00:04:01,591
And I wanna build homes,
I don't wanna wreck them.

82
00:04:01,592 --> 00:04:03,066
- Okay, Hunter, just...

83
00:04:08,827 --> 00:04:11,027
- I just can't believe
that I had to find out

84
00:04:12,206 --> 00:04:13,026
from your daughter.

85
00:04:13,034 --> 00:04:14,654
- Hunter.

86
00:04:14,655 --> 00:04:16,895
I am so sorry.

87
00:04:16,896 --> 00:04:18,376
I fell for you.

88
00:04:19,413 --> 00:04:21,413
I have never felt like that.

89
00:04:23,793 --> 00:04:25,553
And I think that I was just

90
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:29,790
ashamed.

91
00:04:29,793 --> 00:04:31,383
- Ashamed?

92
00:04:32,655 --> 00:04:34,405
- I'm too tired for this.

93
00:04:34,413 --> 00:04:37,283
- Okay look, I know we're
not supposed to take sides

94
00:04:37,284 --> 00:04:38,825
and we're not.

95
00:04:38,827 --> 00:04:43,167
We love Roger very much, but I
have never seen you so happy.

96
00:04:44,034 --> 00:04:45,284
You've been glowing lately

97
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:47,995
and we know it's
because of Hunter.

98
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,340
So we just wanted to
give you the facts.

99
00:04:50,344 --> 00:04:52,904
If this thing is real,
it deserves a chance.

100
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,170
- Can I say something?

101
00:05:03,896 --> 00:05:06,306
God, I would love
another chance with you.

102
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:07,380
- Oh, Hunter.

103
00:05:16,551 --> 00:05:17,381
- Okay.

104
00:05:22,827 --> 00:05:24,895
Oh, that's so nice.

105
00:05:24,896 --> 00:05:26,166
Baby, I don't...

106
00:05:26,172 --> 00:05:27,792
I don't know what you're saying.

107
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,310
- What did I say it wrong?

108
00:05:31,137 --> 00:05:32,757
- I don't know.

109
00:05:32,758 --> 00:05:33,688
I don't know.

110
00:05:33,689 --> 00:05:34,969
I don't speak Portuguese.

111
00:05:36,068 --> 00:05:37,238
- But, aren't you...

112
00:05:37,241 --> 00:05:38,171
You are Portuguese, aren't you?

113
00:05:38,172 --> 00:05:40,932
- Yes, yes, yes, I'm Portuguese.

114
00:05:41,931 --> 00:05:42,791
Look at my skin.

115
00:05:44,448 --> 00:05:47,447
That's not to say that I
don't love what you just said.

116
00:05:47,448 --> 00:05:49,278
Although, I don't
know what it meant.

117
00:05:49,279 --> 00:05:51,715
- Well, I said,

118
00:05:52,827 --> 00:05:57,136
I think I said, no obligations.

119
00:05:57,137 --> 00:05:58,547
You just make me happy.

120
00:06:00,586 --> 00:06:01,616
- I love that.

121
00:06:02,482 --> 00:06:03,312
I love that.

122
00:06:04,275 --> 00:06:05,095
- Isn't that sweet?

123
00:06:05,103 --> 00:06:06,412
- Okay, kids.

124
00:06:06,413 --> 00:06:08,516
- Maybe we can learn together?

125
00:06:08,517 --> 00:06:09,717
- Maybe we can.

126
00:06:09,724 --> 00:06:11,594
- We can learn so
many things together.

127
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,030
- Oh, cheers!

128
00:06:16,034 --> 00:06:17,834
- We'll give you two a room.

129
00:06:20,172 --> 00:06:21,072
- Or a few.

130
00:06:28,862 --> 00:06:30,032
- Wow.

131
00:06:30,034 --> 00:06:31,414
- That is definitely
the asshole of a grape.

132
00:06:32,344 --> 00:06:34,033
- He picked it.

133
00:06:34,034 --> 00:06:35,240
- Portuguese.

134
00:06:35,241 --> 00:06:36,447
- Is it?

135
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:06,070
- Thank you for this,
Mer, truly thank you.

136
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:09,654
I cannot believe her.

137
00:07:09,655 --> 00:07:12,095
- Yeah.

138
00:07:12,103 --> 00:07:14,973
You should've seen the
look I've got from Molly.

139
00:07:14,974 --> 00:07:18,135
I mean, I have seen
that look before.

140
00:07:19,379 --> 00:07:21,589
She's just so cruel now.

141
00:07:22,724 --> 00:07:24,451
I've seen that look
from my sister,

142
00:07:24,452 --> 00:07:25,788
from some of our friends,

143
00:07:25,793 --> 00:07:27,973
but I have never
seen it from her.

144
00:07:27,974 --> 00:07:29,825
And I never expected to.

145
00:07:29,827 --> 00:07:31,687
- I don't get the big deal.

146
00:07:31,689 --> 00:07:33,859
She's a queer, you're a queer.

147
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,100
You can say that now.

148
00:07:37,103 --> 00:07:39,757
- But it's not a
queer, it's just queer,

149
00:07:39,758 --> 00:07:40,588
I think.

150
00:07:42,724 --> 00:07:44,412
- I'm a good mom, aren't I?

151
00:07:44,413 --> 00:07:45,241
- Yeah.

152
00:07:45,242 --> 00:07:46,071
- I tried.

153
00:07:47,448 --> 00:07:49,098
Roger is a great dad

154
00:07:49,103 --> 00:07:52,033
but we just had so
much that didn't work.

155
00:07:52,034 --> 00:07:53,723
- Yeah, I know.

156
00:07:53,724 --> 00:07:55,214
- It's like that old joke,

157
00:07:56,448 --> 00:07:59,788
two ninety year olds go
to the divorce lawyer.

158
00:07:59,793 --> 00:08:03,412
The lawyer says, why
did you wait so long?

159
00:08:03,413 --> 00:08:05,623
You're almost at the
end of your lives.

160
00:08:05,624 --> 00:08:07,240
And the couple says,

161
00:08:07,241 --> 00:08:10,274
we wanted to wait until
the kids were dead.

162
00:08:14,275 --> 00:08:16,755
Is that what we're
meant to do now?

163
00:08:16,758 --> 00:08:18,928
Put a smile on forever,

164
00:08:18,931 --> 00:08:21,281
for the sake of
our adult children?

165
00:08:22,862 --> 00:08:25,999
I have finally reached
my career goals,

166
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,240
my professional goals.

167
00:08:28,241 --> 00:08:33,241
I deserve to truly fall in love
with a man who is passionate

168
00:08:33,862 --> 00:08:37,481
and kind and...

169
00:08:37,482 --> 00:08:42,482
Yeah, maybe somewhat
younger than me, and...

170
00:08:43,068 --> 00:08:43,788
- Chiseled.

171
00:08:43,793 --> 00:08:44,861
You can say it.

172
00:08:44,862 --> 00:08:47,205
- Oh, God. chiseled.

173
00:08:47,206 --> 00:08:48,926
- Very chiseled.

174
00:08:53,068 --> 00:08:54,278
Do you think Molly and Elle

175
00:08:54,279 --> 00:08:56,925
would treat any
other women this way?

176
00:08:58,034 --> 00:09:00,481
I mean, their judgment is so...

177
00:09:00,482 --> 00:09:01,312
- Unwoke.

178
00:09:02,448 --> 00:09:05,136
Everyone is supposed
to be woke now,

179
00:09:05,137 --> 00:09:07,927
but now we're not allowed
to be a part of it?

180
00:09:07,931 --> 00:09:09,001
We started it.

181
00:09:11,827 --> 00:09:13,927
- Well, there's just
always gonna be people

182
00:09:13,931 --> 00:09:16,481
who wanna make you feel
ashamed for something.

183
00:09:17,896 --> 00:09:20,166
I think we just have to
choose not to feel ashamed.

184
00:09:21,931 --> 00:09:23,101
- Amen, sister.

185
00:09:24,896 --> 00:09:26,616
- Oh my God!

186
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:29,447
I need to dance.

187
00:09:29,448 --> 00:09:31,098
Come here.

188
00:09:31,103 --> 00:09:35,723
Francis, where's
that box of wine?

189
00:09:40,793 --> 00:09:42,833
- Did you wanna
come in and say hi?

190
00:09:44,517 --> 00:09:49,274
- I don't think I'm ready to
see your parents just yet.

191
00:09:49,275 --> 00:09:50,165
- Me neither.

192
00:09:51,517 --> 00:09:52,337
Thanks, Roger.

193
00:09:54,827 --> 00:09:57,857
- Give my little girl
a hug for me, would ya?

194
00:09:57,862 --> 00:09:58,692
- Yeah.

195
00:10:02,793 --> 00:10:03,663
Hey, Roger.

196
00:10:04,586 --> 00:10:07,096

with a lot of good
things ahead of you.

198
00:10:09,551 --> 00:10:10,381
- So do you.

199
00:10:11,724 --> 00:10:12,964
Handsome.

200

Honey you made it.

00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,860
- When I imagined
a swinger party

5
00:00:18,862 --> 00:00:21,826
I pictured guy in a thong

00:00:21,827 --> 00:00:25,964
with a rady ponytail and
really bad wallpaper.

7
00:00:25,965 --> 00:00:28,065
Not this, Hunter.

8
00:00:28,068 --> 00:00:29,516
Really?

9
00:00:29,517 --> 00:00:30,447
- Oh, honey.

10
00:00:30,448 --> 00:00:32,654
Come on, we were just dancing.

11
00:00:32,655 --> 00:00:34,995
- No place is safe, oh my god.

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,100
Is this why you waited till
I left home to get a pool?

13
00:00:38,103 --> 00:00:39,378
- Oh, pfh.

14
00:00:39,379 --> 00:00:40,826
Molly, your not
listening sweetie.

15
00:00:40,827 --> 00:00:41,787
Come in here.

16
00:00:41,793 --> 00:00:43,210
Have an adult conversation.

17
00:00:43,211 --> 00:00:44,376
- I don't want to.

18
00:00:45,551 --> 00:00:47,760
I came here to have
a place to stay

19
00:00:47,761 --> 00:00:50,858
for a couple of days and it's
supposed to feel like home.

20
00:00:50,862 --> 00:00:52,032
- Honey,

21
00:00:52,034 --> 00:00:54,654
you're always
welcome in our home.

22
00:00:54,655 --> 00:00:55,825
- Oh sweetie, stop.

23
00:00:55,827 --> 00:00:57,167
You just don't look so good.

24
00:00:57,172 --> 00:00:58,861
- This isn't helping.

25
00:00:58,862 --> 00:01:01,171
- Well, honey I
was honest with you

26
00:01:01,172 --> 00:01:03,522
so that you could
be honest with us.

27
00:01:03,523 --> 00:01:05,167
- Wrong choice, man.

28
00:01:05,172 --> 00:01:08,342
- Hey! Not everyone
in an open marriage

29
00:01:08,344 --> 00:01:11,412
is some kind of sex
addicted freak show.

30
00:01:11,413 --> 00:01:15,033
Between this house,
my job, raising you,

31
00:01:15,034 --> 00:01:18,214
and having a meaningful
relationship with your father

32
00:01:18,215 --> 00:01:20,826
I do not have time to have sex

33
00:01:20,827 --> 00:01:23,547
with every other person I see.

34
00:01:23,551 --> 00:01:26,619
Even if I wanted to.

35
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:27,450
- No, don't.

36
00:01:30,448 --> 00:01:31,618
- Molly, sweetie,

37
00:01:33,103 --> 00:01:35,309
we love you unconditionally.

38
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:38,030
And just because you
disagree with our lifestyle,

39
00:01:38,034 --> 00:01:41,550
don't waste your
time judging us.

40
00:01:43,551 --> 00:01:45,411
You want me to
drive you somewhere?

41
00:01:45,413 --> 00:01:46,930
- I am an adult woman.

42
00:01:46,931 --> 00:01:47,931
I'm taking your car,

43
00:01:47,932 --> 00:01:49,240
I'm taking your phone,

44
00:01:49,241 --> 00:01:51,241
and I will return them
when I'm ready to.

45
00:01:53,448 --> 00:01:54,718
- Molly--

46
00:01:54,724 --> 00:01:56,933
- If you have a
problem with that

47
00:01:56,934 --> 00:01:59,240
then, you should
think long and hard

48
00:01:59,241 --> 00:02:00,964
about why you chose to have me.

49
00:02:01,896 --> 00:02:03,786
- That was my phone!

50
00:02:03,793 --> 00:02:05,171
Who was that?

51
00:02:13,344 --> 00:02:14,172
- Hey.

52
00:02:14,173 --> 00:02:15,002
- Hey.

53
00:02:15,003 --> 00:02:16,447
- You good?

54
00:02:16,448 --> 00:02:19,238
- I don't know, I don't know.

55
00:02:19,241 --> 00:02:22,451
I have literally never been
more happy to see you though.

56
00:02:22,452 --> 00:02:23,858
- Really?

57
00:02:23,862 --> 00:02:25,342
- Yeah, buddy.

58
00:02:27,517 --> 00:02:30,964
- Hey, um, I have a good idea.

59
00:02:30,965 --> 00:02:31,895
- Hit me.

60
00:02:31,896 --> 00:02:34,274
- Um, I am a really good cook.

61
00:02:34,275 --> 00:02:35,785
- Oh, stop being so humble.

62
00:02:35,793 --> 00:02:39,343
- And, um, I'm
done in 20 minutes

63
00:02:39,344 --> 00:02:42,104
and I think you should
let me cook for you.

64
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:45,898
- Oh.
- Is Molly home tonight?

65
00:02:45,899 --> 00:02:47,166
- Oh, fuck. I don't know

66
00:02:47,172 --> 00:02:48,902
she's not my fucking
award so, I don't know.

67
00:02:48,903 --> 00:02:52,476
- Oh, I mean I just,
I didn't know if maybe

68
00:02:52,482 --> 00:02:53,932
she wanted to eat with us.

69
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,757
- Oh, well that's very lovely.

70
00:02:57,758 --> 00:02:59,098
Um, no she'll be fine.

71
00:02:59,103 --> 00:03:00,999
But I am starving, yes.

72
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:01,970
- All right.
- Thank you.

73
00:03:01,971 --> 00:03:04,925
- Great, um I was thinking

74
00:03:04,931 --> 00:03:06,999
my Nanna's shepherd's pie.

75
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,619
When it all comes together it's
got this really rich gravy--

76
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:10,274
- Oh, I'm a vegetarian.

77
00:03:10,275 --> 00:03:11,445
- And beefy, oh.

78
00:03:11,448 --> 00:03:12,968
- I'm sorry.

79
00:03:14,103 --> 00:03:17,173
- Um, I only know how
to make shepherd's pie.

80
00:03:18,551 --> 00:03:19,969
- I thought you were
a really good cook.

81
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:20,965
- Of shepherd's pie.

82
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,654
- Really just like,

83
00:03:23,655 --> 00:03:26,065
honing in on your
one dish there.

84
00:03:26,068 --> 00:03:27,718
- But like it's so good.

85
00:03:27,724 --> 00:03:28,834
- I don't-
- You should maybe eat

86
00:03:28,835 --> 00:03:29,997
some beef for this.

87
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,136
- I won't eat it.

88
00:03:31,137 --> 00:03:32,097
- Mac and cheese?

89
00:03:32,103 --> 00:03:33,343
- Oh, I would eat that.

90
00:03:33,344 --> 00:03:34,524
- Yeah? Like from
the powder kind?

91
00:03:34,525 --> 00:03:35,757
- No.

92
00:03:35,758 --> 00:03:36,998
- Oh, you want boujee
but I can't do that.

93
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,760
- I will literally
eat anything else.

- Okay, wait no.

131
00:05:23,931 --> 00:05:25,761
My mp3 player is on shuffle.

132
00:05:26,724 --> 00:05:28,619
- Mp3 player?

133
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:30,585
Is it 1999 or?

134
00:05:30,586 --> 00:05:32,066
- All right, okay.

135
00:05:32,068 --> 00:05:33,308
I'm shutting this off.

136
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:34,240
We're going to turn
it off, right now.

137
00:05:34,241 --> 00:05:35,447
- No no no no, wait wait wait.

138
00:05:35,448 --> 00:05:36,718
I want to hear it, I
want to hear all of it.

139
00:05:36,724 --> 00:05:37,454
I'm so sorry, I'm
sorry, I'm sorry.

140
00:05:37,455 --> 00:05:38,788
- Batteries out.

141
00:05:38,793 --> 00:05:40,003
- I didn't realize
you were good.

142
00:05:43,517 --> 00:05:44,857
- Wow.
- Sorry.

143
00:05:44,862 --> 00:05:46,552
- So nice of you, okay
- Sorry.

144
00:05:46,553 --> 00:05:47,721
- Listen, before you eat

145
00:05:47,724 --> 00:05:49,794
I just want to say
something very quickly.

146
00:05:49,795 --> 00:05:53,412
I think that you are neat.

147
00:05:53,413 --> 00:05:55,213
You are a neat girl.

148
00:05:56,482 --> 00:05:58,964
- Oh, you are weird.

149
00:05:58,965 --> 00:06:00,585
- Thank you.

150
00:06:00,586 --> 00:06:04,826
- Um, I feel like we
have a thing, right?

151
00:06:05,931 --> 00:06:06,971
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

152
00:06:06,972 --> 00:06:08,785
- Yeah.
- Okay.

153
00:06:08,793 --> 00:06:10,447
Good, great.

154
00:06:10,448 --> 00:06:13,828
Um, but do you...

155
00:06:14,689 --> 00:06:16,309
have a boyfriend?

156
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:17,688
or something?

157
00:06:17,689 --> 00:06:20,826
That guy at Rosie's, was he...

158
00:06:20,827 --> 00:06:22,167
It seemed like he was meeting
your mom for the first time.

159
00:06:22,172 --> 00:06:24,378
- Oh, no. Fuck, no.

160
00:06:24,379 --> 00:06:25,757
That is Hunter.

161
00:06:25,758 --> 00:06:28,067
He's uh-he was with
my mom actually.

162
00:06:28,068 --> 00:06:30,928
My mom and dad, that was her
boyfriend or ex-boyfriend

163
00:06:30,931 --> 00:06:32,481
or fuck I don't know whatever.

164
00:06:32,482 --> 00:06:34,619
So, don't worry about that.

165
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:36,310
- But you guys were...

166
00:06:37,517 --> 00:06:38,787
Okay, I'm officially lost.

167
00:06:38,793 --> 00:06:39,999
- Sorry, yes.

168
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,757
Um, so she had an
affair with him and,

169
00:06:43,758 --> 00:06:45,688
ooh you know what, I don't
really want to talk about it.

170
00:06:45,689 --> 00:06:48,277
If that's okay, I'd love
to not think about it.

171
00:06:48,278 --> 00:06:49,475
I would love to just-

172
00:06:49,482 --> 00:06:52,378
No I would love to
just be here with you

173
00:06:52,379 --> 00:06:53,209
and not think.

174
00:06:53,210 --> 00:06:54,336
- Okay, all right.

175
00:06:54,344 --> 00:06:58,481
- Um, usually I'd, you know, um

176
00:06:58,482 --> 00:07:00,102
but I just, I can't.

177
00:07:00,103 --> 00:07:01,003
- No, no that's fine.

178
00:07:01,004 --> 00:07:02,619
You know what, I wasn't-

179
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:03,826
I didn't expect--

180
00:07:03,827 --> 00:07:04,757
- It's just, it's
weird because I just,

181
00:07:04,758 --> 00:07:06,338
I keep thinking about Christmas.

182
00:07:07,344 --> 00:07:09,074
Like I really love Christmas.

183
00:07:09,075 --> 00:07:11,998
And, um,

184
00:07:13,793 --> 00:07:14,863
You know like, nobody's
every going to love you

185
00:07:14,864 --> 00:07:17,722
the way your parents do.

186
00:07:17,724 --> 00:07:19,864
Right, like that
love doesn't exist

187
00:07:20,931 --> 00:07:22,241
anywhere else in the world.

188
00:07:23,206 --> 00:07:26,236
And,

189
00:07:26,241 --> 00:07:28,621
My family had this
like net around me.

190
00:07:30,034 --> 00:07:33,034
It was like everything was
just handled, you know?

191
00:07:34,413 --> 00:07:37,413
And, my mom fucking
destroyed it.

192
00:07:39,655 --> 00:07:41,585
Completely forever.

193
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,480
And I just, I didn't have
a chance to prepare for it.

194
00:07:48,172 --> 00:07:50,452
Like I didn't realize
that that last Christmas

195
00:07:50,453 --> 00:07:54,278
was going to be our
last Christmas together.

196
00:07:55,793 --> 00:07:57,205
You know?

197
00:07:58,448 --> 00:08:00,478
But just everything
feels colder now.

198
00:08:00,482 --> 00:08:01,792
It just feels cold and I'm

199
00:08:03,034 --> 00:08:05,794
so scared, I'm
terrified all the time.

200
00:08:07,206 --> 00:08:08,166
Which is weird.

201
00:08:09,344 --> 00:08:11,033
And I just don't know
who else is going to

202
00:08:11,034 --> 00:08:13,378
love me like that, you know?

203
00:08:13,379 --> 00:08:17,719
Like the way my whole family
in all togetherness loved me.

204
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:19,450
But I get it, right.

205
00:08:19,451 --> 00:08:21,028
Like, I'm an adult.

206
00:08:21,034 --> 00:08:24,071
So I should just get the
fuck over it and move on.

207
00:08:24,072 --> 00:08:25,998
But I can't because
it's my family.

208
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,240
- Okay, okay. No,
no, no it's okay.

209
00:08:30,068 --> 00:08:31,585
Do you...

210
00:08:31,586 --> 00:08:34,236
Did you ever hear
about that ski hill

211
00:08:34,241 --> 00:08:35,791
made out of garbage.

212
00:08:37,413 --> 00:08:39,964
They built on top
of an incinerator.

213
00:08:39,965 --> 00:08:41,654
- What?

214
00:08:41,655 --> 00:08:42,755
What are you talking about?

215
00:08:42,758 --> 00:08:45,098
- It's in Copanae again.

216
00:08:45,103 --> 00:08:46,833
It converts something like

217
00:08:48,275 --> 00:08:51,785
400,000 tons of
waste into energy.

218
00:08:53,172 --> 00:08:54,172
You ever heard of that?
- Nope.

219
00:08:54,173 --> 00:08:55,522
- It's called Copenhill.

220
00:08:55,523 --> 00:08:56,997
- Oh.
- Yeah.

221
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,380
Yeah pretty cool, you
see how I did that?

222
00:08:58,381 --> 00:08:59,719
Yeah, fancy.

223
00:08:59,724 --> 00:09:01,964
And, um,

224
00:09:01,965 --> 00:09:04,165
all that garbage

225
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,274
nobody wanted it.

226
00:09:06,275 --> 00:09:07,275
Of course not, it's garbage,

227
00:09:07,275 --> 00:09:08,205
it's trash get rid of it
- Right.

228
00:09:08,206 --> 00:09:10,026
But look what those danes did.

229
00:09:10,034 --> 00:09:12,516
They took all that
stinky garbage,

230
00:09:12,517 --> 00:09:13,617
that trash,

231
00:09:14,724 --> 00:09:17,343
and they made something
kind of beautiful.

232
00:09:17,344 --> 00:09:18,174
Kind of useful.

233
00:09:21,413 --> 00:09:23,033
- What I'm saying is-it's fine.

234
00:09:24,448 --> 00:09:29,408
I would rather ski knowing
all of that, than not.

235
00:09:32,551 --> 00:09:37,551
- So is my mom the
incinerator ski hill dump,

236
00:09:38,275 --> 00:09:39,995
or am-like I'm garbage?

237
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,136
- Yes, you're garbage.

238
00:09:41,137 --> 00:09:41,997
I'm trying to say that

239
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,205
you're garbage.

240
00:09:43,206 --> 00:09:44,616
- Okay, great as long
as we're clear on that.

241
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:47,240
- Yeah no.

242
00:09:50,448 --> 00:09:51,518
Families are hard.

243
00:09:53,413 --> 00:09:56,412
You've got this
mishmash of people

244
00:09:56,413 --> 00:09:58,623
living together
trying to get along,

245
00:09:58,624 --> 00:10:00,999
trying to figure
out who they are.

246
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,240
- Yeah, yep.

247
00:10:03,448 --> 00:10:06,718
um, you just,

248
00:10:06,724 --> 00:10:08,074
you don't really
get it, you know.

249
00:10:08,075 --> 00:10:09,378
Cause I've lost my mom.

250
00:10:10,344 --> 00:10:11,174
It's..

251
00:10:14,965 --> 00:10:16,785
- Did I ever tell you
about my dead dad?

252
00:10:18,827 --> 00:10:20,307
Did I ever tell you that?

253
00:10:20,310 --> 00:10:22,000
- Yeah, my dad
died when I was 25.

254
00:10:23,931 --> 00:10:27,211
Suddenly... and immediately

255
00:10:28,931 --> 00:10:32,211
felt like half of me
had been ripped away.

256
00:10:33,310 --> 00:10:36,170
Like I felt empty on one side.

257
00:10:37,896 --> 00:10:39,446
Felt off kilter.

258
00:10:41,241 --> 00:10:43,481
And I felt like
my life was over.

259
00:10:43,482 --> 00:10:46,136
And...

260
00:10:46,137 --> 00:10:49,097
took me years to
figure out that,

261
00:10:50,344 --> 00:10:52,384
that whole was not
going to get replaced.

262
00:10:53,344 --> 00:10:55,454
It's just the way it is.

263
00:10:57,034 --> 00:11:00,314
And he was nowhere
near perfect but,

264
00:11:03,206 --> 00:11:04,926
I miss him every single day.

265
00:11:07,310 --> 00:11:10,240
And I'm never going to be able
to tell him that I loved him.

266
00:11:13,275 --> 00:11:14,995
And Christmas is really hard.

267
00:11:21,896 --> 00:11:24,586
And I think that if you
have someone who loves you

268
00:11:26,379 --> 00:11:28,619
you just got to let them love
you in the way that they do.

269
00:11:30,310 --> 00:11:32,760
And you got to find a
way to love them back

270
00:11:33,931 --> 00:11:35,141
when you have the chance.

271
00:11:39,448 --> 00:11:40,928
- I'm so sorry.

272
00:11:40,931 --> 00:11:41,901
- It's okay.

273
00:11:41,902 --> 00:11:43,336
- No, I'm sorry for your loss.

274
00:11:43,344 --> 00:11:45,144
I'm, like, sitting here
talking about losing my family

275
00:11:45,145 --> 00:11:46,757
and you're an actual orphan.

276
00:11:46,758 --> 00:11:48,998
- Okay, I'm
not an actual orphan.

277
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,720
- No I just

278
00:11:51,724 --> 00:11:54,484
I think I fucked things
up with Molly, you know?

279
00:11:54,485 --> 00:11:56,654
And she's the feelings, like I-

280
00:11:56,655 --> 00:11:58,375
She's really my only friend.

281
00:11:59,551 --> 00:12:02,309
and I'm such an asshole like,

282
00:12:02,310 --> 00:12:03,829
why are you still even here?

283
00:12:03,830 --> 00:12:05,857
- I live here. This is my house.

284
00:12:05,862 --> 00:12:09,242
- You made me dinner and you
play all these instruments

285
00:12:09,243 --> 00:12:11,381
that are here that you play.

286
00:12:12,862 --> 00:12:14,932
You play that instrument?

287
00:12:15,931 --> 00:12:17,861
- Yes, I do.
- Do you play that one?

288
00:12:17,862 --> 00:12:19,102
- That was a gift. I don't.

289
00:12:19,103 --> 00:12:21,343
- And your just so sweet
and I know you

290
00:12:21,344 --> 00:12:22,999
- Okay, okay, okay.

291
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,688
Listen, you have
very good conviction.

292
00:12:26,689 --> 00:12:28,279
This is strong but,

293
00:12:30,068 --> 00:12:31,208
I see you.

294
00:12:32,793 --> 00:12:34,833
I don't think you're
any of those things.

295
00:12:36,905 --> 00:12:38,066
I really like you.

296
00:12:38,068 --> 00:12:38,928
- Oh.

297
00:12:40,724 --> 00:12:43,831
- Despite your incessant
mocking of my mp3 player.

298
00:12:43,832 --> 00:12:45,067
- I have to.
- Why?

299
00:12:45,068 --> 00:12:48,548
- Because it's not 1999.
- I love it.

300
00:12:48,551 --> 00:12:50,861
No system is better
than that mp3 player.

301
00:12:50,862 --> 00:12:52,282
- There are many better systems.

302
00:12:52,283 --> 00:12:54,165
- No, it's perfect.

303
00:12:57,827 --> 00:12:59,207
- I'm really tired.

304
00:13:00,448 --> 00:13:01,208
- Okay.

305
00:13:03,379 --> 00:13:08,209
Well, how about I just
sit here with you.

306
00:13:14,034 --> 00:13:15,034
We'll just sit here.

307
00:13:17,344 --> 00:13:18,174
- Why?

308
00:13:19,586 --> 00:13:21,306
- Well because we have to
wait for the pizza to arrive.

309
00:13:21,310 --> 00:13:23,170
- Oh, fuck yes.

310
00:13:23,172 --> 00:13:25,522
- Yeah, cause we're
not eating that shit.

311
00:13:25,523 --> 00:13:27,447
- But it's two whole colors.

312
00:13:27,448 --> 00:13:30,208
- Yeah, two whole colors.

313
00:13:32,206 --> 00:13:33,476
- It's okay.

314
00:13:33,482 --> 00:13:34,972
We could put it on the pizza.

315
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,860
♪ I think your scars are sweet

316
00:13:45,862 --> 00:13:48,722
♪ And your harelip's neat

317
00:13:48,724 --> 00:13:53,724
♪ And I love your eyes

318
00:13:56,344 --> 00:14:01,314

strange, strange life ♪

1
00:00:16,724 --> 00:00:18,102
- I'm very busy.

2
00:00:18,103 --> 00:00:19,343
What, Elle?

3
00:00:19,344 --> 00:00:20,723
Jordan, get over here.

4
00:00:20,724 --> 00:00:21,554
Great job.

5
00:00:22,758 --> 00:00:23,828
You're doing amazing.

6
00:00:23,829 --> 00:00:25,027
You're like a son to me.

7
00:00:26,862 --> 00:00:28,282
What are you looking at?

8
00:00:28,283 --> 00:00:29,715
Shut it.

9
00:00:29,724 --> 00:00:30,757
No.

10
00:00:30,758 --> 00:00:32,338
Shut up.

11
00:00:32,344 --> 00:00:33,688
Ginger bitch.

12
00:00:38,758 --> 00:00:40,688
- Mom, hi!

13
00:00:40,689 --> 00:00:44,719
- Oh, hope you had some nice
mental health days, Eleanor.

14
00:00:44,724 --> 00:00:46,144
- Mom, I don't think you're
supposed to say mental health

15
00:00:46,145 --> 00:00:47,337
that way anymore.

16
00:00:47,344 --> 00:00:49,521
- I'm looking froward
to the meeting.

17
00:00:49,522 --> 00:00:51,097
I can hardly handle
the suspense.

18
00:00:51,103 --> 00:00:53,102
- Well yeah, of course.
I will see you at 9--

19
00:00:53,103 --> 00:00:55,481
9:30, yes you will.

20
00:01:00,965 --> 00:01:03,135
- I am the creator
of my own destiny.

21
00:01:03,137 --> 00:01:04,657
It's 9:29, Elle.

22
00:01:13,206 --> 00:01:13,996
- Okay.

23
00:01:17,206 --> 00:01:19,786
Thank you so much for
taking this meeting with me.

24
00:01:19,793 --> 00:01:20,933
I know you're so busy.

25
00:01:20,934 --> 00:01:23,067
- Yes, what is this about Ellie?

26
00:01:23,068 --> 00:01:24,858
Oh, that grocery chain
didn't pull out, did they?

27
00:01:24,862 --> 00:01:27,205
Because I cannot
handle that today.

28
00:01:27,206 --> 00:01:28,026
Jordan!

29
00:01:28,034 --> 00:01:28,902
Get in here--

30
00:01:28,903 --> 00:01:29,716
- Uh, nope.

31
00:01:31,724 --> 00:01:34,240
They are in, it's
not about that.

32
00:01:34,241 --> 00:01:35,069
I--

33
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:35,928
- Then what?

34
00:01:38,827 --> 00:01:40,307
- Sorry, are you mad at me?

35
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:44,690
- Why would I be mad at you?

36
00:01:45,551 --> 00:01:47,311
- Well, I just, um

37
00:01:48,758 --> 00:01:50,447
- Would it be because
you took it upon yourself

38
00:01:50,448 --> 00:01:52,858
to meddle in my
personal business?

39
00:01:52,862 --> 00:01:55,450
Molly told her parents
what you said to Hunter.

40
00:01:55,451 --> 00:01:56,478
- What? That's..

41
00:01:58,275 --> 00:01:59,715
I'm not, that's, um

42
00:01:59,724 --> 00:02:00,764
that's not fair.

43
00:02:00,765 --> 00:02:02,447
I think that we--

44
00:02:02,448 --> 00:02:04,378
- Yeah, well I would love
to know what you think.

45
00:02:04,379 --> 00:02:05,619
I am all ears.

46
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:07,410
- Mom, please.

47
00:02:07,413 --> 00:02:08,792
- What do you want, Elle?

48
00:02:08,793 --> 00:02:11,002
I am seriously losing
patience with you.

49
00:02:11,003 --> 00:02:12,280
- I just told him the truth!

50
00:02:12,281 --> 00:02:14,475
- It was not your truth to tell.

51
00:02:14,482 --> 00:02:18,412
- I am so fucking sick of lying.

52
00:02:18,413 --> 00:02:21,002
I'm so sick of
pretending like I'm okay,

53
00:02:21,003 --> 00:02:23,480
like everything's
okay, I'm not okay.

54
00:02:24,551 --> 00:02:26,761
I'm so fucking sad.

55
00:02:30,931 --> 00:02:34,378
You haven't even asked
me how I'm doing.

56
00:02:34,379 --> 00:02:36,067
Like, so what?

57
00:02:36,068 --> 00:02:38,518
I broke up your
minute-long relationship.

58
00:02:38,519 --> 00:02:40,027
I'm your only kid.

59
00:02:40,034 --> 00:02:41,240
- Well it didn't work,

60
00:02:41,241 --> 00:02:42,791
because Hunter and I
are stronger than that.

61
00:02:42,793 --> 00:02:43,623
- I

62
00:02:45,758 --> 00:02:47,828
I don't know who this person is.

63
00:02:47,829 --> 00:02:48,827
She's not my mom.

64
00:02:50,068 --> 00:02:53,408
You know, I came in
here to thank you

65
00:02:53,413 --> 00:02:54,833
for being a mentor to me.

66
00:02:54,834 --> 00:02:57,997
Hmm? But you know what,
you're not my mentor.

67
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,999
So here's what I'm
actually saying.

68
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:00,860
- Elle

69
00:03:00,862 --> 00:03:02,447
- Top five clients.

70
00:03:02,448 --> 00:03:03,278
- What?

71
00:03:03,279 --> 00:03:04,515
What about them?

72
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:06,516
- Actually, sorry no,
former top five clients

73
00:03:06,517 --> 00:03:08,307
because they have decided

74
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:10,309
to go with a younger,
more current ad agency.

75
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:11,550
- What?

76
00:03:11,551 --> 00:03:13,411
Jordan, why did you
not tell me this?

77
00:03:13,413 --> 00:03:16,102
- I mean you of all
people should know, right?

78
00:03:16,103 --> 00:03:17,792
People should do what
makes them happy?

79
00:03:17,793 --> 00:03:20,453
It's better for everyone
in the long run, right?

80
00:03:24,827 --> 00:03:25,927
- I've never heard of them.

81
00:03:25,931 --> 00:03:26,861
- It's a new company.

82
00:03:26,862 --> 00:03:27,590
- You're working for them?

83
00:03:27,591 --> 00:03:28,516
- I am them.

84
00:03:29,482 --> 00:03:31,516
And I'm taking your assistant.

85
00:03:31,517 --> 00:03:32,617
Jonathon!

86
00:03:34,517 --> 00:03:35,857
I just doubled your salary.

87
00:03:35,862 --> 00:03:37,757
- Oh, shit.

88
00:03:37,758 --> 00:03:40,897
- I hope you and Hunter
are very happy together.

89
00:03:40,898 --> 00:03:43,586
Maybe he'll be better at
doing what you tell him to do.

90
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:47,830
I'm fine.

91
00:03:49,034 --> 00:03:50,074
- It's Jordan.

92
00:03:51,068 --> 00:03:51,928
It's Jordan.

93
00:03:53,413 --> 00:03:54,213
I

94
00:03:55,344 --> 00:03:56,826
Patricia, I--

95
00:03:56,827 --> 00:03:58,067
- You're not going anywhere.

96
00:03:58,068 --> 00:03:59,588
- I love the days that
we spend doing hot yoga

97
00:03:59,589 --> 00:04:01,066
on Sunday mornings, but I--

98
00:04:01,068 --> 00:04:02,308
- You're staying here, don't go.

99
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:05,340
- It's just, twice the,
could you do triple.

100
00:04:05,344 --> 00:04:06,554
- I don't think so.

101
00:04:06,555 --> 00:04:08,101
No.

102
00:04:08,103 --> 00:04:11,619
- I'm gonna, I'm gonna
leave that for you.

104

- Hey.

112
00:04:41,482 --> 00:04:42,280
- Rosie, Jonathon,
Jonathon, Rosie.

113
00:04:42,281 --> 00:04:43,165
- It's Jordan.

114
00:04:43,172 --> 00:04:44,412
- Hi.

115
00:04:44,413 --> 00:04:45,863
- I need to work from
here for a few days.

116
00:04:45,864 --> 00:04:47,792
- Okay, anything for you.

117
00:04:47,793 --> 00:04:48,793
- Great.

118
00:04:48,794 --> 00:04:50,240
- Here you go.

119
00:04:50,241 --> 00:04:52,101
- Do you have
any Skinnygirl Margaritas?

120
00:04:52,103 --> 00:04:52,973
- No.

121
00:04:55,206 --> 00:04:56,274
- Hey, are you okay?

122
00:04:56,275 --> 00:04:57,205
- Yeah.

123
00:04:57,206 --> 00:04:58,406
- What's happening?

124
00:04:58,413 --> 00:04:59,413
- No, I'm fine,
I'm good, I'm fine.

125
00:04:59,414 --> 00:05:01,861
- So is Jordan your new Molly?

126
00:05:01,862 --> 00:05:02,999
- How did you know that?

127
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:03,970
Uh, who's Jordan?

128
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,378
What, are you, are you serious?

129
00:05:08,379 --> 00:05:10,654
Fuck, okay yes.

130
00:05:10,655 --> 00:05:12,995
Jordan is my new assistant.

131
00:05:14,103 --> 00:05:15,757
- For

132
00:05:15,758 --> 00:05:17,447
- I started a new business,

133
00:05:17,448 --> 00:05:20,277
and we are gonna work
out of my second bedroom

134
00:05:20,278 --> 00:05:22,305
because it didn't work
out with Molly, so.

135
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:24,520
- Is that why she
moved back to England?

136
00:05:24,521 --> 00:05:25,787
- What?

137
00:05:25,793 --> 00:05:28,002
- Yeah, she took the
Red-eye last night.

138
00:05:28,003 --> 00:05:29,210
She called me on the way.

139
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,968
- Oh, so she calls you, Jesus.

140
00:05:33,969 --> 00:05:36,235
- Take it easy, all right,
Molly and I are friends

141
00:05:36,241 --> 00:05:38,519
and she needed to
talk to a friend.

142
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:40,587
I wish you'd told me
about her earlier.

143
00:05:40,588 --> 00:05:43,336
I think it's great that she's
going for what she wants.

144
00:05:44,862 --> 00:05:46,067
- Yeah.

145
00:05:46,068 --> 00:05:47,757
- We should celebrate, right?

146
00:05:47,758 --> 00:05:50,308
Um, do you have like,
a Red-headed Slut,

147
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:51,826
do you know how to make that?

148
00:05:51,827 --> 00:05:52,687
- Of course I do.

149
00:05:56,279 --> 00:05:57,654
- Fuck.

150
00:05:57,655 --> 00:05:59,205
- Coming!

151
00:06:03,448 --> 00:06:04,276
- Molly.

152
00:06:04,277 --> 00:06:05,095
- Shh

153
00:06:05,103 --> 00:06:06,283
- Uh

154
00:06:07,931 --> 00:06:10,451
- Molly, what are
you doing here?

155
00:06:13,448 --> 00:06:14,278
Uh

156
00:06:16,827 --> 00:06:18,997
Molly, for fuck's sake, just

157
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:26,654
No, it's fucking November.

158
00:06:26,655 --> 00:06:29,615
No, Molly just stop
this now, stop, stop it.

159
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:30,860
What are you doing?

160
00:06:30,862 --> 00:06:32,792
- Just let me say this
as quickly as possible.

161
00:06:32,793 --> 00:06:35,103
I know this is not okay.

162
00:06:36,379 --> 00:06:40,205
I, I just needed to
say to your face,

163
00:06:40,206 --> 00:06:42,205
to your actual face,

164
00:06:42,206 --> 00:06:44,656
that I know now that
you're my person.

165
00:06:46,103 --> 00:06:49,002
And I can handle anything
that comes along with that

166
00:06:49,003 --> 00:06:51,860
because everything is
easy if it's with you.

167
00:06:53,103 --> 00:06:56,378
You have me in your
pocket forever,

168
00:06:56,379 --> 00:06:58,519
so if you wanna be with
me, you just call me

169
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:01,717
and I will get on a
plane, another plane,

170
00:07:01,724 --> 00:07:04,864
or in a cab, it depends

171
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,790
- Just give me a minute.

172
00:07:13,793 --> 00:07:14,623
- Okay.

173
00:07:18,758 --> 00:07:21,928
- Babe, come back to bed.

174
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:29,790
- Molly, um, I

175
00:07:31,379 --> 00:07:32,209
Molly

176
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:34,450

1
00:00:01,433 --> 00:00:03,232
We could use
a man of your talents, Chase.

2
00:00:03,233 --> 00:00:05,599
Going back to France and Poland.
How do you feel about that?

3
00:00:05,624 --> 00:00:06,783
That would suit me.

4
00:00:06,784 --> 00:00:09,063
I know real strength when I see it.

5
00:00:09,064 --> 00:00:10,852
And you have it in abundance.

6
00:00:10,853 --> 00:00:12,223
I don't feel very strong right now.

7
00:00:12,224 --> 00:00:15,023
What will you tell the child
when they ask where their dad is?

8
00:00:15,024 --> 00:00:18,303
There's a war.
I'll tell them you're dead.

9
00:00:18,304 --> 00:00:20,863
I would look after you and the baby.

10
00:00:20,864 --> 00:00:22,823
Papa!

11
00:00:22,824 --> 00:00:24,900
She will stay here, where she is safe.

12
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,399
I get out of here,
it'll be somewhere worse.

13
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:31,959
So don't stir things up.

14
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:34,399
You shouldn't be here!

15
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:37,039
If I have to die for my country, I will.

16
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:38,639
First contact, local resistance.

17
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,719
And if I fail to make contact?

18
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:42,560
Improvise.

20
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:35,994
With the Germans firmly in control
of much of mainland Europe,

21
00:01:35,995 --> 00:01:38,543
there is no doubt Hitler's attention now

22
00:01:38,568 --> 00:01:40,719
is focused toward Great Britain.

23
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:44,534
As yet, Churchill's forces have
held at bay the Nazi threat

24
00:01:44,535 --> 00:01:47,999
which has so ruthlessly
advanced across the continent.

25
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,359
Nation after nation falling
to the sheer force

26
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,399
of the Blitzkrieg campaign.

27
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:56,159
For how much longer Britain
can defy its momentum

28
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:57,919
seems soon to be proven.

29
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:01,199
Their army much depleted,
they look to their Navy

30
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,319
and the Royal Air Force
to defend their island.

31
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:07,928
These are the darkest of times
for Britain, for Europe,

32
00:02:07,929 --> 00:02:09,700
and indeed the rest of the world.

33
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:23,260
How are you finding the training?

34
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,359
I'm improving.

35
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,759
I'm only theoretically dead
three times a day now.

36
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:30,600
- Maybe some of the...
- Three times a day is better than most.

37
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,460
I've called you in
because you leave tomorrow night.

38
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:39,079
The drop is radio equipment
and light explosives.

39
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:41,439
The return journey will be on land,

40
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:44,060
getting a group of key
resistance fighters out.

41
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:47,159
This kind of operation
carries the highest risk.

42
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:49,439
So I'd think about getting
your affairs in order

43
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,440
before you leave.

44
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,420
Five minutes.

45
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:29,500
I'm going away. There's a good
chance I won't make it back.

46
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:32,180
I want you to know I've made a will.

47
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,479
You will be the sole beneficiary.

48
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:37,359
How many times? I don't want your money!

49
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,700
It isn't for you.

50
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:45,620
If something does happen, then
you won't get my war pension...

51
00:03:47,693 --> 00:03:49,173
...because you're not my wife.

52
00:03:55,019 --> 00:03:56,019
Well, good.

53
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,839
I'm glad we sorted that out.

54
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,180
Thanks for telling me.

Klaus?

I'm sorry.

71
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,439
Your father didn't want you to know.

72
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:07,279
He wanted you to think it was
an accident.

73
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,180
Why should I believe you?

74
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:10,799
I have proof

75
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,900
of their whole euthanasia programme
if you want it.

76
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,360
No.

77
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,639
No. I don't need proof.

78
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:22,580
I know what they're capable of,
and I'm part of it.

79
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:27,519
I'm fighting for them.

80
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:28,599
I'm on their side.

81
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:31,199
Whether I like it or not,
I'm fighting for their cause.

82
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,359
You have no choice.

83
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,740
Yes, I do have a choice, Frau Campbell.

84
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:40,159
I'm just too weak to make it.

85
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,460
No.

Mm-hm.

93
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:26,119
Thank you, Nancy.

94
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:30,079
I do not know what you've
said to him, but thank you.

95
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:33,199
If I lose Klaus, I've lost everything,

96
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:35,759
and if a parent can't
look after their child,

97
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:38,239
then what use are they on God's Earth?

98
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,199
Children never stop needing you.

99
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:44,399
Their pain is like our pain,
isn't it? Always.

100
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:47,119
You have children too, Miss Campbell?

101
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,500
You didn't say.

102
00:07:49,233 --> 00:07:50,533
I have a child.

103
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:52,720
A son.

104
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:58,180
He's grown-up now, my son.

105
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:07,780
There's a lot of musicians
in here, Webster.

106
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:11,679
Jazz guys mainly,
but a fair few classical musicians.

107
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:14,799
Wait till those German bastards
hear us play Beethoven.

108
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,959
How's that for inferior race,
you Nazi pigs?

109
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:19,700
The main thing is we get you out.

110
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,799
I will find a way.

111
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,959
I've got an orchestra
waiting for me, Webster.

112
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:27,399
Wait... Please...

113
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:30,119
I don't understand,
why are you being like this?

114
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,580
I know it's hard.

115
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:36,359
No, you don't. That's just it.

116
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:38,100
You don't know. You can't know.

117
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:41,999
The queers in here with me, they know.

118
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,919
The blacks in here, they know.

119
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:46,839
The Jews, the scum,

120
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,940
that's me, that's us.

121
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:52,660
I'm the one in the fucking cage here.

122
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,380
You can walk out whenever you like.

123
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:57,719
And I'm telling you,

124
00:08:58,100 --> 00:08:59,820
don't ever come back, Webster.

125
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,600
Albert...

126
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:09,920
Albert!

127
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:51,840
Tomasz!

128
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:57,600
Chodz.

129
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:13,519
Let's go this way. I know somewhere.

130
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:15,020
It's quieter down here.

131
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,340
No, I know a house. Come with me.

132
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:28,100
Easy, soldier! You're hurting me.

133
00:10:36,755 --> 00:10:38,028
Tomasz!

134
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:18,840
Lois!

135
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:25,559
Come on, Lois!
Come on, love. You can do it.

136
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,039
I can't, I can't, I can't!

137
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:30,319
I hate to tell you, love,
but you've got no choice.

138
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,639
Don't make me laugh.

139
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:34,599
The baby'll come too soon
and grow up to be a ventriloquist.

140
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:36,100
Now you're making me laugh!

141
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:54,679
Come on, push. Brilliant. Come on,
now. Push. That's it. Nearly there.

142
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,359
You don't want to go in there,
Douglas. Believe me.

143
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:03,239
I don't want to go in,
I just want to know how she is.

144
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,500
She is beautiful!

145
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,220
She is.

146
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:33,519
You've got a grand-daughter, Douglas!

147
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:34,900
And she's beautiful.

148
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:37,220
Right.

149
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:49,940
You all right, love?

150
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:52,759
Yeah.

151
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:55,020
Just your regular Saturday night,
you know.

152
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,323
Hello, you.

157
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:34,639
<i>and that our great country
will do all it can</i>

158
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:37,443
<i>to fight on against their common enemy.</i>

159
00:14:27,226 --> 00:14:29,740
Mother? Is everything all right?

160
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,719
Is it Jan?

161
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,060
The baby's been born.

162
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:36,980
YOUR baby's been born.

163
00:14:38,073 --> 00:14:39,073
A girl.

164
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Oh!

165
00:14:44,119 --> 00:14:45,559
- A girl?
- Yes!

166
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,239
I see.

167
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:54,000
Douglas came round to tell me,
flushed with excitement.

168
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:57,239
I think he was hoping I would reciprocate

169
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:59,559
and dash to the little bastard's
manger, bearing gifts.

170
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:01,359
Don't use that word.

171
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,959
Why not? Does it insult your sense
of decency?

172
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:06,319
- Yes. It does.
- In what way?

173
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:09,079
The fact that I said what is true or
the fact that you believe it too?

174
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:11,919
I do not believe it.
It's a disgusting word.

175
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,839
And it's what the child is.

176
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:16,239
What YOUR child will always be called!

177
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:17,559
Perhaps in your world.

178
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:19,199
And not in Lois's?

179
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:22,119
Where the warm-hearted poor will
take an under-the-stairs child

180
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:26,460
and hold it to their collective
bosom in their socialist utopia?

181
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,606
I've seen the warm-hearted poor

182
00:15:28,607 --> 00:15:30,239
at that wretched school that Jan attends.

183
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,919
I've seen the way they treat outsiders.

184
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,799
Why are you even telling me this?

185
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,519
Lois wants nothing to do with me.

186
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:38,119
And she wants me to have nothing
to do with the baby!

187
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:40,919
- You have a choice.
- I am respecting her wishes!

188
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:43,119
Which conveniently coincide
with your own?

189
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:45,860
I am committed to providing
for that child.

190
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:48,340
For my child!

191
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:53,239
Have you promised money?
Are you going to see the baby?

192
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:54,439
No, of course not!

193
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:57,399
Well, why not? Now you're displaying
this sudden concern.

194
00:15:57,400 --> 00:16:00,079
Because it would break my heart,
you foolish boy!

195
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:01,480
When did you grow a heart?

196
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:32,580
I'm sorry.

197
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,639
I just wanted to, um...

198
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:36,399
I gave you the benefit of the doubt

199
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:39,079
when our Lois started first
knocking about with you.

200
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:41,900
Let's just say you wouldn't
have been my first pick.

201
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,079
You made that very clear at the time.

202
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:48,039
But a lad from your background
getting stuck in on the politics,

203
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:51,519
the decisions you made, the stand
you took, can't have been easy.

204
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:53,679
I've met your mother, remember.

205
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:54,799
But this...

206
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,820
...this...

207
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:00,279
...you got this so wrong.

208
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:04,719
You will miss out on her loving you
and on you loving her.

209
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:08,020
So, in the end, I feel sorry for you.

210
00:17:09,886 --> 00:17:10,886
What do I do?

211
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,599
You carry your pain.

212
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:15,119
You live with it.

213
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:16,940
That's what you bloody well do.

214
00:17:36,419 --> 00:17:38,820
Is that you pretending to be a grown-up?

215
00:17:40,613 --> 00:17:44,980
Auntie Nancy?
What are you doing in Paris?

216
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:48,319
So good to see you!

217
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:50,719
Who have you spoken to
in the authorities?

218
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:53,639
Nobody. Just the dumb-ass guards
at St Denis.

219
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:55,599
Do you have any friends
in the officer class?

220
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:56,999
A guy called Sieber.

221
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,279
But he doesn't have very much say.
Have you?

222
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,479
I have plenty.

223
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,959
And this friend of yours,
is he a political activist?

224
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,919
- A trade unionist?
- No.

225
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:06,300
He's French-African.

226
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,039
Ah! All right.

227
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,279
I suspect that was enough.

228
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:13,439
I can't make any promises,
but my censor is with us

229
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:14,879
in Paris with the press corps.

230
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:17,199
- I will talk to him.
- That would be great.

231
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:20,079
- And, er, I'll keep making a noise here.
- No.

232
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:22,279
If you want them
to leave the hospital alone,

233
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:23,759
leave the noisemaking to me.

234
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,319
Monsieur?

235
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:27,159
And this Albert,

236
00:18:27,806 --> 00:18:30,046
he clearly means a great deal to you.

237
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:32,340
Yes.

238
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:36,360
I thought so.

239
00:18:56,521 --> 00:18:58,479
I'm leaving the country tomorrow.

240
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,039
Of course you are.

241
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:01,940
And I don't want us to part like this.

242
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,260
I'm sorry for what I said.

243
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,220
About my heart?

244
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:15,820
Well, it was witty, at least.

245
00:19:41,053 --> 00:19:43,700
I don't know what to do about
gestures like that.

246
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:48,040
A lot of people did that
when your father died.

247
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:57,879
I mean, does one take the hand
and squeeze it back?

248
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:59,500
And what does that mean?

249
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:05,180
That you are now comforting
the comforter?

250
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:10,420
That you're reassuring
the comforter that you're fine?

251
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:16,319
That you got over
the embarrassment of your grief?

252
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:20,912
Is that how you see grief?
As an embarrassment?

253
00:20:20,913 --> 00:20:23,180
No, not generally.

254
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:27,799
But for our particular circumstances.

255
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:28,800
Father was sick.

256
00:20:30,186 --> 00:20:33,060
He came back from the war a sick man.

257
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,879
And I know how that can happen now.

258
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,839
What he did was unforgivable.

259
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:41,359
Would you feel the same way
if he had been killed in action?

260
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:42,959
No, of course not.

261
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:45,439
His death wouldn't have
been his responsibility.

262
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:48,279
And bad luck. But not by his own hand.

263
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:50,860
- And planned.
- He was destroyed...

264
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:55,239
...every bit as completely as if
he'd been blown to smithereens.

265
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:57,999
No, other men suffered,
other men saw bad things.

266
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,839
But they came back
and they got on with it.

267
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:01,599
Perhaps he just wasn't strong enough.

268
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:04,140
Well, that's a polite way of saying
he was weak.

269
00:21:06,586 --> 00:21:08,306
And you can't forgive him for that?

270
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:15,860
No, I'm afraid I cannot.

271
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:26,239
And it's an indescribably sad feeling.

272
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:27,240
But I can't.

273
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:33,120
We're going to have to do
something about this.

274
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:35,780
Here.

275
00:21:36,399 --> 00:21:37,522
Ta.

276
00:21:37,708 --> 00:21:40,199
You and her should have my
room, and I'll stay in here.

277
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:43,300
What about Tom? When he comes back?

278
00:21:45,347 --> 00:21:46,780
He's not coming back.

279
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:50,479
You don't believe he's dead?

280
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,959
I've got more than myself
to think about now, haven't I?

281
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:56,039
Well, I'm glad I gave you something
to take your mind off things.

282
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:57,620
That was the plan all along.

283
00:22:05,119 --> 00:22:07,660
Harry knows. Come round last night.

284
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:12,060
I, er, sent him away.

285
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:14,879
Hope I did right.

286
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:15,880
You did.

287
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:32,759
Oh, no, no, no!

288
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:34,159
Oh, no!

289
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:37,759
No, no, no! No!

290
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:43,399
Dad? Aren't you going to answer it?

291
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:45,719
If we don't open the door,
they can't tell us.

292
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:47,719
And if they can't tell us,
then it won't be true.

293
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:49,119
Dad, we have to open the door.

294
00:22:50,393 --> 00:22:51,500
Hello?

295
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:54,119
Hello? I'm looking for Lois Bennett.

296
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:56,279
I was told she lives here.

297
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:58,820
It's nothing to do with Tom.
I promise you.

298
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:13,660
I don't understand, Vernon.

299
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:18,959
Why would you do this? Look at me.

300
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:21,079
A girl who got into trouble
with another man's child.

301
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:22,959
No money, no prospects.

302
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:25,199
I have no prospects either.

303
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:29,199
Well, death, I suppose,
is a prospect of sorts.

304
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,759
But I can provide for you and your child,

305
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:33,880
and I can't think of anything
I'd rather do.

306
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:39,119
What if you were to just marry me
on impulse and think about it later?

307
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:42,279
We've only been in the same room
for about two hours in total.

308
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:44,639
And how have you liked it so far?

309
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:47,820
Stop! You have to stop this!

310
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:50,479
I have no expectations.

311
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:52,460
I have no assumptions...

312
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:54,320
...about this marriage.

313
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:58,679
The world is wrong right now.

314
00:23:59,282 --> 00:24:00,454
It's so wrong.

315
00:24:00,455 --> 00:24:02,439
And if I'm risking my life
every day to go

316
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:05,300
and kill someone, then why not
take a risk to love someone?

317
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:08,359
And by someone, I mean me, by the way.

318
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:09,679
Not just anyone.

319
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:12,079
That would have a comic tragedy
in keeping with my love life

320
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:15,380
so far, and I'm probably not selling
myself very well right now.

321
00:24:16,446 --> 00:24:17,446
Vernon...

322
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:22,399
...I am tired and I am lonely
and I am weak just now.

323
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:26,879
And it would be so easy
to say yes to you.

324
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,260
So easy.

325
00:24:29,053 --> 00:24:30,053
But I can't.

326
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:37,380
You are a dear, sweet man,
but I can't just say yes.

327
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:41,000
All I ask of you is that you consider it.

328
00:24:42,853 --> 00:24:44,533
You don't have to love me.

329
00:24:45,787 --> 00:24:47,587
You just have to let me love you.

330
00:24:53,726 --> 00:24:55,060
_

331
00:24:55,586 --> 00:24:56,740
_

332
00:24:56,786 --> 00:24:58,786
_

333
00:24:59,420 --> 00:25:01,420
_

334
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,159
I could come with you.

335
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:06,199
I've been to Stanford Grove
Elementary School.

336
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:07,980
I'm not afraid of anything.

337
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:12,260
_

338
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:14,500
_

339
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,600
_

340
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:19,820
_

341
00:25:21,613 --> 00:25:22,613
I don't believe you.

342
00:25:24,367 --> 00:25:25,807
But it's nice that you say it.

343
00:25:27,979 --> 00:25:30,979
You sound just like your sister
when you say things like that.

344
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:33,080
Just like her.

345
00:26:02,679 --> 00:26:06,100
_

346
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:11,634
_

347
00:26:12,078 --> 00:26:16,380
_

348
00:26:19,194 --> 00:26:21,194
_

349
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:23,780
_

350
00:26:28,922 --> 00:26:32,820
_

351
00:26:38,005 --> 00:26:40,005
_

352
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:44,960
_

353
00:28:49,274 --> 00:28:50,580
_

354
00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:56,140
_

355
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:05,020
_

356
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:07,580
_

357
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:11,940
_

358
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:15,660
_

359
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:22,220
_

360
00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:29,620
_

361
00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:41,660
_

362
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:46,260
_

363
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:49,260
_

364
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:10,160
Thank you for coming, Douglas.

365
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:13,079
Yes, I came as soon as I could.

366
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:14,159
So I see.

367
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:18,439
Recent experience has inured me
to the power of surprise,

368
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:20,580
- so no need to apologise, Douglas.
- Right.

369
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:25,159
Jan is registered here as a refugee,
so they knew where to find him,

370
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:27,359
and with Harry away,
I didn't know who to contact.

371
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:29,396
You haven't told him? He doesn't know?

372
00:30:29,397 --> 00:30:31,635
What, that his brother's in
the local lunatic asylum?

373
00:30:31,636 --> 00:30:33,180
Why would I tell him that?

374
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:37,039
It says here he's being
treated for shellshock.

375
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:39,399
The main thing is Jan's brother's alive,

376
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:41,442
and Jan needs to know.

377
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:44,759
Well, what if he wants to go
and see him? What then?

378
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:46,780
I can't possibly go to a place like that.

379
00:30:47,946 --> 00:30:49,420
No-one's asking you to.

380
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:58,439
What is this place?

381
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:00,359
It's a hospital.

382
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:01,680
A kind of hospital.

383
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:05,399
You know what, Jan,

384
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:08,959
I shouldn't have, er,
I shouldn't have brought you.

385
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:11,260
I want to go inside, Douglas.

386
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:16,879
Well, there'll be people here
who are very upset

387
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:18,880
and I'm worried it'll upset you.

388
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:33,260
How do you know where to go?

389
00:31:34,653 --> 00:31:36,300
Because this is where I came...

390
00:31:37,273 --> 00:31:38,273
...when I was ill...

391
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:46,420
...like this man.

392
00:31:48,533 --> 00:31:49,533
Hey.

393
00:31:51,806 --> 00:31:53,100
It's all right, mate.

394
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:56,079
It's all right. I know.

395
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:58,380
I know. I know how this feels.

396
00:31:59,747 --> 00:32:01,620
I know what you're going through, mate.

397
00:32:03,012 --> 00:32:04,012
Can I help you?

398
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:09,080
Um...

399
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:16,380
Well, you didn't help me last time,
so I doubt it.

400
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:18,599
Do I know you?

401
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:20,039
Have we met?

402
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:21,580
Yeah, we've met all right.

403
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:26,279
I was treated here after 1916.

404
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:28,159
And your name is...?

405
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,700
Scrimshanker.

406
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:31,879
Yeah.

407
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:34,940
Least that's what you used to call me.

408
00:32:37,839 --> 00:32:39,420
Coward, it means, doesn't it?

409
00:32:42,566 --> 00:32:46,820
Do you still want to call me
a scrimshanker now I'm well?

410
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:48,710
Mr Bennett!

411
00:32:48,711 --> 00:32:50,799
Mr Bennett! Mr Bennett! It's my brother!

412
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:53,060
It's Grzegorz! It's Grzegorz!

413
00:33:02,305 --> 00:33:04,305
_

414
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:11,567
_

415
00:33:11,567 --> 00:33:13,960
_

416
00:33:14,472 --> 00:33:16,472
_

417
00:33:16,497 --> 00:33:17,497
Shh.

418
00:33:17,665 --> 00:33:19,960
_

419
00:33:22,211 --> 00:33:23,460
_

420
00:33:24,380 --> 00:33:25,980
_

421
00:33:26,230 --> 00:33:29,060
_

422
00:33:55,220 --> 00:33:56,660
_

423
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:58,940
_

424
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:02,340
If you want to eat, you are going
to have to put this gun down.

425
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,860
How many Germans did you kill?

426
00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:11,740
I don't know.

427
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:15,439
When you go back and fight,
you must take me.

428
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:16,639
I will kill more.

429
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:19,999
No, I may not go back and fight.

430
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,580
I may stay here.

431
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:23,700
But you'll get better...

432
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:25,880
...and then you can fight.

433
00:34:27,420 --> 00:34:29,420
_

434
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:46,119
I have my arms and my legs...

435
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:49,719
...and I get through the day,

436
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:54,060
but when I close my eyes...

437
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,380
When I close my eyes, all I see is...

438
00:35:00,380 --> 00:35:05,100
...bad and black and...

439
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:07,759
...I cannot shake it.

440
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:10,180
It's... It's like...

441
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:13,199
...something got in.

442
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:15,100
It's like a...

443
00:35:15,715 --> 00:35:17,740
...stranger in my head.

444
00:35:20,187 --> 00:35:21,580
It will get better.

445
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:25,079
It will.

446
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:28,140
He thinks I can look after him
right now...

447
00:35:29,753 --> 00:35:31,460
...but I can't, Mr Bennett.

448
00:35:33,339 --> 00:35:34,500
Not yet.

449
00:35:35,993 --> 00:35:37,220
I'll explain.

450
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:45,380
We will go back.

451
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:49,508
We will go back when Gregor is well

452
00:35:50,149 --> 00:35:51,520
and ready to come out.

453
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:54,940
Harry promised me it would be happy.

454
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,080
When he came back...

455
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:00,919
...we would be happy.

456
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:04,479
Well, I don't know what gives Harry
the right to promise that.

457
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:06,239
It's not something that you can promise.

458
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:09,239
It's just something that you hope for.

459
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:10,740
Harry was wrong?

460
00:36:11,479 --> 00:36:14,300
To promise or to break his promise?

461
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:16,740
Both.

462
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:22,079
Harry's, er, got a habit of being wrong.

463
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:23,959
- What?
- Nothing, son.

464
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:25,540
Nothing. Just forget it.

465
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,599
When we get in,

466
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:30,679
we could play chess.

467
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:31,839
Yeah, we could, son,

468
00:36:32,420 --> 00:36:34,119
if that's what you'd like.

469
00:36:34,386 --> 00:36:35,386
We could.

470
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:53,079
I'm never sure what one is
supposed to say.

471
00:36:53,780 --> 00:36:56,039
It's not as though there's much
that is remarkable

472
00:36:56,593 --> 00:36:57,793
at this stage, is it?

473
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:01,519
Is that what you thought,
after you had Harry?

474
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:04,359
I thought he was remarkable to have
survived my mothering from day one.

475
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:06,620
I still feel it now.

476
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:12,860
Do you want to hold her?

477
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,000
What for?

478
00:37:18,013 --> 00:37:19,220
It doesn't matter.

479
00:37:25,353 --> 00:37:26,860
Jan would miss you.

480
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:29,279
He'd miss Douglas, too,

481
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:30,900
if you stopped visiting.

482
00:37:31,553 --> 00:37:32,833
Why would I stop visiting?

483
00:37:34,773 --> 00:37:38,060
Well, because you'd have to provide
an explanation for the baby.

484
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:42,431
You're worried I'll
tell him she's Harry's.

485
00:37:42,456 --> 00:37:43,468
Yes.

486
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:46,180
Not for Harry's sake, but for Jan's.

487
00:37:48,446 --> 00:37:50,340
The boy worships Harry...

488
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:56,839
...and he's already lost everything
that he ever believed in,

489
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:59,780
and we've no idea
when we'll see Harry again.

490
00:38:00,753 --> 00:38:02,513
I'll keep Harry's secret.

491
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:20,639
I wanted you to have this

492
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:23,100
towards the upkeep of the child.

493
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:26,879
- In exchange for my not telling Jan.
- No.

494
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:29,940
No, that was an appeal
to your conscience.

495
00:38:31,173 --> 00:38:33,573
This is an appeal to your common sense.

496
00:38:37,407 --> 00:38:38,447
Please take it.

497
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:53,380
Harry's not cut out for fatherhood.

498
00:38:58,906 --> 00:39:00,106
You've done the right thing.

499
00:39:11,319 --> 00:39:12,319
Robina!

500
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:14,500
Ah.

501
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:16,860
I just felt I should...

502
00:39:19,780 --> 00:39:21,199
How was the hospital?

503
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:22,639
Not nice,

504
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:26,119
but, er, Jan met his brother,
so I think that helped them both.

505
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:27,660
Well, that IS good...

506
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:30,679
...and I know it must have been
hard for you.

507
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:33,180
And this for you.

508
00:39:34,246 --> 00:39:35,526
It had to be done...

509
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:39,540
...and I am a great believer in doing
what has to be done.

510
00:39:40,859 --> 00:39:41,859
Yeah.

511
00:39:45,286 --> 00:39:46,286
Goodbye.

512
00:39:53,686 --> 00:39:54,686
Rob...

513
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:14,319
What is amusing?

514
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:16,719
I don't know
if amusing is the right word,

515
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:18,119
but I see you all here

516
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:20,559
and it is as though you always knew
you would end up here,

517
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:23,039
that this is what the war
is really about.

518
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:26,460
You needed Paris for a boy's
holiday destination.

519
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:29,879
- I think we are fulfilling our destiny.
- Is that why you went easy

520
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:31,919
on the French? Compared to
the Poles, I mean?

521
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:35,479
Because you didn't want to damage
all the good hotels and restaurants.

522
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:37,359
I think you have a bit of an
inferiority complex

523
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:38,740
when it comes to Paris.

524
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:41,359
Are we flirting?

525
00:40:41,786 --> 00:40:42,786
No.

526
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:46,599
- Then why did you ask me to dinner?
- I didn't.

527
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:50,719
I asked you about an interned French
musician and you invited me here.

528
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:54,679
Well, if he has been interned,
there must have been a reason.

529
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:56,359
We have to protect our people.

530
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:59,879
His flat was requisitioned by
some of your guys, he objected,

531
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:02,959
and now he's been arrested
and interned as a subversive.

532
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:05,279
He's French-North African.

533
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:06,999
Then he isn't French.

534
00:41:07,180 --> 00:41:08,839
So, you're not going to help me.

535
00:41:09,113 --> 00:41:10,713
Is this musician your lover?

536
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:14,239
I've never met him.

537
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:16,399
He's a friend of my nephew's.

538
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:18,519
But do you have a lover in Paris?

539
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:19,879
If you're not going to help me,

540
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:21,500
I'm not playing games with you.

541
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:24,079
It's a simple enough question.

542
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:25,300
Do you have a lover?

543
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:31,940
No. I do not have a lover.

544
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:36,799
So...

545
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:42,500
...perhaps there's a path opening up...

546
00:41:43,732 --> 00:41:45,332
...which would give me a reason to help.

547
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:50,689
As flattered as I am by your offer
of prostitution,

548
00:41:50,690 --> 00:41:51,959
I'm going to decline.

549
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:54,380
You might want to let go of my hand now.

550
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:02,599
I have protected you
more than I have needed to.

551
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:06,719
And what, you'd like me to show my
gratitude by going to bed with you?

552
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:09,020
Schmidt, you're such
a disappointment to me.

553
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:15,806
I had you down for intellectually
confused, morally conflicted

554
00:42:15,807 --> 00:42:17,306
and a political coward,

555
00:42:17,307 --> 00:42:20,020
but somehow I thought, I imagined...

556
00:42:20,887 --> 00:42:22,687
...you were above this kind of thing.

557
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:25,460
I'm a patient man...

558
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:29,239
...but I don't think you are in
a position to negotiate.

559
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:32,719
No, but I'm in a position to stick
a steak knife in your balls

560
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:36,100
and make you squeal like a girl
in front of your comrades.

561
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:39,620
That's not me flirting.

562
00:42:40,679 --> 00:42:42,519
Just so you're not confused.

563
00:42:55,880 --> 00:42:59,159
Jesus Christ! I thought you had some
influence with these people.

564
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:01,959
I'll do a report, broadcast,

565
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:03,799
on the internment policy.

566
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:05,319
I can do it in the studio here in Paris

567
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:06,959
and maybe make it round the censors.

568
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:09,719
Yeah. How about we organise
a bake sale and I pray?

569
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:12,319
For God's sakes! I tried!

570
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:15,140
The guy just wanted to fuck me.

571
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:20,620
So, don't talk to me like I didn't try.

572
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:24,540
Don't talk to me like I did nothing!

573
00:43:31,039 --> 00:43:32,039
Auntie Nancy?

574
00:43:36,546 --> 00:43:37,546
Auntie Nancy?

575
00:43:39,840 --> 00:43:42,159
- You're never like that.
- No.

576
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:44,180
- You just don't...
- React...

577
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:46,039
...to bad things. I know.

578
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:48,940
It's how you are, how you've always been.

579
00:43:51,339 --> 00:43:53,079
There's a reason for that.

580
00:43:54,899 --> 00:43:55,899
So...?

581
00:43:56,760 --> 00:43:58,079
Are you...? I mean, are you...?

582
00:43:58,080 --> 00:43:59,080
I was attacked...

583
00:44:00,979 --> 00:44:02,419
...my first time in Europe.

584
00:44:04,573 --> 00:44:05,700
I was raped.

585
00:44:07,580 --> 00:44:11,039
Some civil servant in Portugal.

586
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:13,100
I was covering the uprising...

587
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:16,000
...and it happened.

588
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:22,639
And women get raped in conflicts
all the time,

589
00:44:23,286 --> 00:44:24,646
and it happened to me.

590
00:44:27,266 --> 00:44:28,860
And that's all you need to know.

591
00:44:34,120 --> 00:44:36,879
I love you, and all that,

592
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:40,639
and you are a kind and gentle man,

593
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:43,199
but that's not how I deal

594
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:44,900
with this kind of thing.

595
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:48,820
I never have, and I'm not going
to start now.

596
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:52,280
I should go.

597
00:44:57,220 --> 00:44:58,839
Will you go back to Berlin?

598
00:44:58,840 --> 00:44:59,919
For now.

599
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:02,839
I don't know how long I'll be
able to work there.

600
00:45:03,060 --> 00:45:04,719
And you?

601
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:06,839
Are you going to stay in Paris?

602
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:09,519
I'll stay as long as I'm needed,
if I can help.

603
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:11,119
Be careful.

604
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:14,121
These people don't need
an excuse to hurt you,

605
00:45:14,146 --> 00:45:15,706
and I don't want to see you hurt.

606
00:45:25,373 --> 00:45:26,373
Goodbye.

607
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:41,439
<i>Britain battles on
alone while the Luftwaffe</i>

608
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:44,639
<i>wages its now daily assault
on the Royal Air Force.</i>

609
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:46,679
<i>Here, we see our boys returning
safely home,</i>

610
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:50,039
<i>only to prepare for battle
once more and return to the skies.</i>

611
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:53,279
<i>Their time back on solid ground
is often very short lived,</i>

612
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:55,319
<i>and just as often, fraught with anxiety</i>

613
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:57,365
<i>about those comrades yet to return.</i>

614
00:45:57,880 --> 00:46:00,959
They're due back any minute now.
We can wait over there.

615
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:02,279
I hope Vernon's all right.

616
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:03,719
Maybe we should just go.

617
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:05,599
Maybe you should write him a letter.

618
00:46:05,600 --> 00:46:07,959
No, he came to me
and asked me to marry him.

619
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:10,919
I owe him an answer in person,
even if it is a no.

620
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:12,839
He won't be listening to an explanation.

621
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:14,719
He'll just hear no.

622
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:17,359
Lois, have you ever met a man
that wanted to hear you explain

623
00:46:17,360 --> 00:46:19,300
just why you're turning him down?

624
00:46:20,660 --> 00:46:22,239
But I'd like to know why.

625
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:24,481
I know what it's like to love somebody

626
00:46:24,482 --> 00:46:26,479
and not have them love you in return.

627
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:28,959
I know what it's like to torture
yourself trying to guess

628
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:30,900
what's in somebody's heart.

629
00:46:31,320 --> 00:46:33,639
Vernon deserves an explanation,

630
00:46:33,640 --> 00:46:35,500
and he deserves it in person.

631
00:46:48,080 --> 00:46:50,380
Randy, isn't it?

632
00:46:51,153 --> 00:46:52,153
Lois.

633
00:46:53,906 --> 00:46:55,220
I see you had the baby.

634
00:46:56,046 --> 00:46:57,726
That's usually how it works, yes.

635
00:46:59,600 --> 00:47:00,759
Is Vernon back?

636
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:03,359
- I mean, the squadron leader.
- Erm, no.

637
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:04,360
We, erm...

638
00:47:05,720 --> 00:47:07,279
It got sticky and...

639
00:47:07,593 --> 00:47:10,060
Saw him take down two Junkers
but lost him after that.

640
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:13,399
He got shot down?

641
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:14,759
We don't know.

642
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:17,439
His radio went down,
but radios go down all the time.

643
00:47:17,660 --> 00:47:19,159
He's not back.

644
00:47:19,379 --> 00:47:20,379
That's all we know.

645
00:47:44,548 --> 00:47:45,780
_

646
00:48:31,192 --> 00:48:32,392
This can't be happening.

647
00:48:34,806 --> 00:48:36,646
This can't really be happening.

648
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:08,799
Hey, there he is.

649
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:10,040
Top man.

650
00:49:11,360 --> 00:49:12,820
Touch-and-go for a moment.

651
00:49:13,880 --> 00:49:15,260
I didn't doubt it.

652
00:49:19,160 --> 00:49:21,959
We thought you were a goner.
It's good to see you.

653
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:22,999
Good job.

654
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:24,519
Got into a spin over Hull,

655
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:27,359
dropped 6,000 feet and had to limp
home with a battered fuselage.

656
00:49:27,360 --> 00:49:30,039
Managed to glide into
a field about 20 miles away.

657
00:49:30,040 --> 00:49:32,879
It was all a damned sight easier
than riding a ladies' bicycle.

658
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:34,839
You're alive! You're alive!

659
00:49:34,840 --> 00:49:36,980
Of course I am. I'm indestructible.

660
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:42,519
Do you have an answer?

661
00:49:42,520 --> 00:49:43,839
Yes, I do. Yes!

662
00:49:43,840 --> 00:49:45,260
I want to marry you.

663
00:49:50,440 --> 00:49:52,560
Huh! Good.

664
00:50:09,273 --> 00:50:10,900
Don't look at me, please.

665
00:50:11,686 --> 00:50:13,940
I can't think of anything I'd rather do.

666
00:50:16,626 --> 00:50:18,300
I thought I'd never see you again.

667
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:22,340
Now you have.

668
00:50:26,680 --> 00:50:27,680
Now I have.

669
00:50:32,673 --> 00:50:33,673
There's you.

670
00:50:35,880 --> 00:50:36,920
There's Kasia.

671
00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:43,040
No.

672
00:50:44,080 --> 00:50:46,900
That Kasia has gone, Harry.

673
00:50:48,440 --> 00:50:50,919
I know you must have been through
so much, but if we can just...

674
00:50:50,920 --> 00:50:53,479
Things I have done. Bad things I've done.

675
00:50:53,480 --> 00:50:54,559
That's what war is.

676
00:50:54,560 --> 00:50:57,119
No, Harry, we choose.

677
00:50:57,387 --> 00:50:58,387
We choose...

678
00:51:00,020 --> 00:51:01,340
...and I chose to kill.

679
00:51:02,120 --> 00:51:03,539
You had to survive.

680
00:51:03,540 --> 00:51:05,060
I still had a choice.

681
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:08,919
And for my country,
for the people, for my family,

682
00:51:08,920 --> 00:51:10,239
that was the right thing to do,

683
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:13,660
but there was a price...

684
00:51:14,919 --> 00:51:16,980
...and the price was the old Kasia.

685
00:51:18,739 --> 00:51:22,460
The girl you fell in love with,
she isn't there any more.

686
00:51:26,900 --> 00:51:29,959
I tried to find her and she isn't there.

687
00:51:29,960 --> 00:51:31,340
You still love me...

688
00:51:32,320 --> 00:51:33,679
...and I love you.

689
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:36,382
And that counts for so little.
Really, it does.

690
00:51:36,383 --> 00:51:38,119
It is all that matters.

691
00:51:38,120 --> 00:51:41,439
No. I think the world just proved
you wrong, Harry,

692
00:51:41,679 --> 00:51:44,119
and it is dangerous to think like this.

693
00:51:45,360 --> 00:51:48,039
You are such a romantic. I think...

694
00:51:48,040 --> 00:51:51,919
You think we can get back
to England and be like we were.

695
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:53,599
I'm here to get you out.

696
00:51:53,600 --> 00:51:55,420
I'm here because you are in danger...

697
00:51:58,693 --> 00:52:00,820
What happens after that,
I have no idea...

698
00:52:02,920 --> 00:52:04,580
...but I'm here to get you out.

699
00:52:06,520 --> 00:52:07,940
We have survived...

700
00:52:09,360 --> 00:52:11,479
...and neither of us are the same,

701
00:52:11,480 --> 00:52:12,839
but you must come,

702
00:52:12,840 --> 00:52:15,679
even if it is only to honour
who we used to be,

703
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:18,660
and if not that, then Jan.

704
00:52:40,886 --> 00:52:42,140
It's him.

705
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:50,980
Raise a glass to us
once you get to Yugoslavia.

706
00:52:51,626 --> 00:52:52,626
Good luck.

707
00:52:54,767 --> 00:52:55,767
Idziemy.

708
00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:33,720
Harry!

709
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:42,460
I'll find you at the top of the hill. Go!
