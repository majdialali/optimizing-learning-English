# optimizing-learning-English:

A big-size individual and optional project of a master course called ACIT4510 Statistical Learning in OsloMet. The goal of this research work is  participating in optimizing learning the English language for  non-native speakers by using techniques from statistics, AI, and NLP. 

The implementation goes mainly about extracting the frequency of English words and expressions (more specifically phrasal verbs) from real English conversations, series subtitles. In other words, our model tries to optimize learning the shortcuts of spoken English by analyzing subtitles of chosen American series(13k lines).

Please have a look on a file called 'description.pdf' for more details about this project.
